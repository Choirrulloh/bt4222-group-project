CNET también está disponible en español.. Nokia 130 lasts more than a month, costs 19 euros. The new old-school Nokia 130 comes in single or dual-SIM versions and goes on sale in China, India and Africa.. August 11, 2014 2:14 AM PDT. Nineteen euros won't buy you much in this day and age, but it will buy you a no-frills Nokia phone. The Nokia 130 is an old-school mobile phone at an old-school price for developing markets, with basic smartphone features like music and video in a phone that will last over a month before it needs juicing up.. This new phone is one of the first to be announced since Microsoft bought the phone-manufacturing part of Finnish company Nokia -- and, per Microsoft's plans to ditch the brand, perhaps one of the last phones to have Nokia written on it. Before the brand disappears, however, Microsoft will use the Nokia name as a trojan horse to build up Windows Phone in regions where the smartphone market is still in its relative infancy. Although the 130 isn't a Windows Phone, it is an opportunity for Microsoft to build on Nokia's popularity to corner more of the budget end of the market in these regions.. Microsoft says the Nokia 130 will go on sale in selected countries, including China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Vietnam. Exact release dates are yet to be confirmed, but it will be "this quarter" -- so between now and September. Both the single and dual-SIM models will cost the equivalent of 19 euros (about £15, $25, or AU$28) when bought unlocked and SIM-free. Nokia traditionally gives its prices in euros, and it looks like Microsoft is continuing that policy for the moment.. It's a candy bar phone with a 1.8-inch colour screen above an old-fashioned nine-button keypad, with soft keys in the middle. The 130 comes encased in white, black or red.. How the £100 Nokia points the way for Microsoft in CNET.... Nokia Lumia 530 costs less than 100 euros. Remember your first Nokia? Here's what it would look like today. Did Microsoft hand Nokia second-guessers a new reason for old critique?. Nokia, Xbox Studios part of Microsoft's big cuts. Basic it may be, but there's still a few features that you'd find on a more powerful smartphone, including music and video. Powered by Series 30+ software, the 130 has a microSD slot for up to 32GB of MP3s or video. It has an FM radio built in-too.. The battery lasts 36 days on standby, an impressive amount when most smartphones won't last 36 hours.. As with many of Nokia's cheaper phones, there are two versions: a single-SIM version and a model that holds two SIM cards.. Dual-SIM phones are useful for anyone who wants to combine their work and personal numbers in one phone, or hand out different numbers to their significant others and their bits on the side. They're popular in developing countries but less so in mature markets such as the UK and US.. Be respectful, keep it clean and stay on topic.

more ... more .... more ... more .... Release date: Sep 1, 2014. Small dimensions (4.17 x 1.79 x 0.55 inches). Lacks a camera on the back. Does not support automatic screen brightness. Low pixel density screen (114 ppi). The Nokia 130 is a budget phone featuring a 1.8-inch LCD screen, music and video players, FM radio and a microSD card slot to store your tunes.. Dimensions: 4.17 x 1.79 x 0.55 inches (106 x 45.5 x 13.9 mm). Weight: 2.42 oz (69 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Features: Numeric keypad, Soft keys, D-Pad. Resolution: 128 x 160 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 13.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 36.0 days (864 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern..

First, Flipkart delivered it quickly and had a very good packaging. Now about the Nokia 130 Pros: 1. Build : Solid and durable build. I had dropped it multiple times,other than few scratches it is working fine. Once it mic stopped working after a drop, but got fixed on it own after a restart. Battery : For a regular normal usage of 30-45 mins call per day, and 20 mins of music on and only one sim , the battery comes to approx 1 week. Hi I bought this Phone from FlipKart after doing Hours of Online research for a Good Basic Phone This was actually going to be used by my Mom It is one of the best Basic Phones i have came across Pros: 1.Does not looks like a cheap Phone, in fact looks like a LUMIA series Phone from back 2.Good Battery Backup & takes very less time to get fully charged 3.Signal reception is very Strong 4.Loud & Clear Loud Speaker during Call & listening FM 5.Very bright Torchlight 6.Right Pricing Cons: Th.... Best buy for your Parents !. Its good looking ; Very light weight ; not very expensive ; great sound quality for both phone calls and Radio. Excellent battery life And most importantly, very easy to use for the elderly. And yes , it has classic "Snake" game also ;) I bought it at 1765 here at Flipkart.. Its a very simple phone that has very good quality audio output. The speakers are much better than the smart phones. Smart phones get heated up when playing music continuously but that issue is not there in this phone, u can play music loudly (no earphones) continuously without any issue. USB charging port is a good thing and it gets charged when connected to a computer for media transfer. It really is small and looks beautiful (White version) and i strongly recommend this phone if u r lookin.... Good set for value :. Light weighted, best calling and voice quality. This can be used elderly people too with ease. I use this mobile when I drive two wheeler due to its light weight and small in size. Do not belive on the advertisement. Cabin made with poor quality plastic. Quality check not done properly, Some functions are not at all working.This mobile is not a good option.. beware this phone, it was written bright red but color received is orange and when we try to return they instead tell they will not as picture is orange but i buy from app its appears like red only .flipkart is now the same as before customer guy are rude and stick to their point. So no option I have to have it and buy it other one as it’s a gift for mom and she didn’t like it. But definitely i will prefer other ecommerce sites like amazon, snap deal to buy next time. Not upto the mark Basic Mobile. cons 1)There is NO IN CALL TIMER. You won't know when your call starts by just looking at screen. KEEP it sticking to your ear to see if call is connected. 2)Bluetooth is namesake - only for sharing objects. BLUETOOTH HANDS-FREE are NOT supported at all. 3)Shows hint for editing call volume whenever you dial a number and this bullshit feature can't be turned off anywhere. 4)Screen goes dark while making call and single clicking RED button doesn't wake it up. You need to CLICK TWICE to use.... Memory card is not accessible through data cable as mentioned in specification. Replaced one time for this reason. But new piece has same issue.. Q: this mobile contact cartoon symbols ?. Q: can we put cartoon symbols on contacts. A: no we cannot..its doesnt have emojis here its not smileys. Q: can we put cartoon symbols on contacts. A: yeah off course y not.. Q: can we put cartoon symbols on contacts. Q: Does this phone have Tamil language option?. Q: In this mobile contacts saving Images Are they ?.

After a few years of being almost exclusively in the smartphone telecom industry, it seems that Microsoft is changing course, a bit. Back in April 2014, Microsoft acquired Finnish tech company Nokia with the intent of becoming larger players in the smartphone industry. After the acquisition, Nokia stopped all production of smartphones on every operating system other than Windows Phone. Despite this full fledged effort and push behind the Nokia Lumia smartphone line, Microsoft has failed to increase its market share in the United States and abroad, which currently hovers in low single digits. What's worse, in July of this year, Microsoft decided to cut 18,000 jobs, 12,500 of which belonged to former Nokia employees.. Microsoft has recently announced a new phone, the Nokia 130. The Nokia 130 is an entry level smartphone that will have a price point of around $25 that will be geared towards emerging markets. It will come with a version that supports dual sim technology, giving you the ability to have two different phone numbers work on the same phone. The Nokia 130 will not run on the Windows Phone operating system, but rather on the Nokia 30+ series OS, and will not even come with a camera.. The Nokia 130 will be bare bones and comes with specs that are a blast from the past, including a long lasting battery life (36 days in standby mode). It will also feature Bluetooth 3.0, expandable storage up to 32GB, and a video and music player. Though the phone cannot necessarily do very much, it will do very little, very well. Microsoft is marketing their newest feature phone as an inexpensive, easy, phone that just makes sense to have because it is so inexpensive.. For now, they are targeting markets that are relatively untapped by the industry leading operating systems Apple IOS and Google Android: lower income people in Africa, China, and India. This phone will not be available initially in the United States, where there is not currently the same demand for feature phones; however, it is very possible that Microsoft markets this phone in the US and Europe as a phone to have that you wouldn't care too much what happened to it, especially if it does well abroad. The Nokia 130 is a phone to take on an adventurous hike, to the beach, on a run, or anyplace that you would not normally want to take your primary device and risk damaging it. At a price point of $25, there's almost no reason to not buy it-- it's almost like buying a cheap pair of jeans from the thrift store. You don't need them, but you'd rather get a pair of jeans from the thrift store messed up than your nice pair from Levi Strauss or Banana Republic.. If you are currently a Windows Phone user or fan, don't be too worried-- Microsoft doesn't want to abandon you. If Microsoft's play to lower end markets turns successful, we could see their influence in the entire mobile phone industry--smartphone industry included--increase and improve as a result of gained capital and users..

Microsoft and Xiaomi will pair up on AI-powered speakers and hardware. HoloLens adds mixed reality to a Japanese national treasure. Microsoft's Mixer lets viewers buy games straight from livestreams. The ESA says preserving old online games isn't 'necessary'. The $25 Nokia 130 proves Microsoft's not done with dumbphones. Facebook is itching to connect the next billion people. Microsoft has been itching to get in on the fun too, and while there's no shortage of cheap Windows Phones to entice all those first-time smartphone shoppers around the world, the folks in Redmond still have their eyes on the most developing of developing markets. That's why the company just pulled back the curtain on what may be the dumbest of dumbphones: the Nokia 130 , a $25/€19 device that makes phone calls, fires off SMS messages and... Alright, maybe that's not totally fair -- after all, the 130 does accept microSD cards, sport an LED flashlight (no camera here, natch) and play videos. Just, you know, don't expect to cruise the web on this thing. Microsoft's trying to position it as a first cell phone, or a backup in case you don't want to ruin your fancy smartphone while traipsing through the backcountry. Here's the thing, though: the release of the 130 isn't just Microsoft cleaning house, a last spasmodic cough meant to clear the pipes for newer, smarter devices to come. Microsoft vice president Jo Harlow told Re/code that the company is committed to the low-end cause, adding that Microsoft doesn't have anything else to reach that valuable swath of users. Need even more proof? Check out this tweet from Microsoft spokesperson Doug Dawson:. - Doug Dawson (@theDougDawson) August 11, 2014. @greengart @jonfingas To clarify - We will continue to offer a portfolio of Nokia-branded mobile phones. It's not hard to see how Microsoft could gain some ground with this approach. If they hook first-time phone buyers with cheap, robust hardware, they've got a target pool they can tease with the promise of a more-connected future through services like OneDrive working in tandem with Windows Phones. But whether or not things go down exactly that way? That's another story entirely.. microsoft , mobilepostcross. Lenovo's Yoga 730 is a cheaper 2-in-1 with Alexa support.
