Mobiles / Gionee Mobile Phones / Gionee M2017 Price in India. User Visits: 59 Compare. The Chinese handset maker, Gionee has always been known for its impressive mid-range and budget segment smartphones. However, the brand is now trying to step its game in the market with the launch of a premium high end smartphone called Gionee M2017. The handset been placed in the same price segment as high-end flagship phones like iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy Note 8. However, does the device lives up to its price tag? We take a look at the pros and cons of the handset and bring you this brief overview.. This something that has never been heard of before on a smartphone. The Gionee M2017 comes with a massive 7,000mAh battery out of the box. This is probably the biggest battery out there till date and should see the user for atleast a day or two on a full charge. Moreover, the handset does support the quick charging feature, which means the massive battery does not take long to charge.. The handset also has a dual camera module on the rear panel to appease those who love to click images on their smartphones. The rear camera module on M2017 comprises of 12MP + 13MP sensors, which are capable of producing impressive Bokeh and monochrome images. Moreover, Gionee is known for its camera centric devices and M2017 is not here to disappoint.. The display dominating the front panel of the device is a massive 5.7-inch affair, which makes it an ideal handset for multimedia and gaming. Moreover, the brand has equipped the display with a resolution of Quad HD, which translates into a pixel density of 515 PPI. The sharpness and vividness of the display is evident from the resolution and pixel density.. The good news is that handset comes with massive onboard storage of 128GB, however, at one point or another a power user is bound to run out of the space. It would have helped to have the option to expand the storage. However, Gionee has given expandable storage a miss in this handset, which will disappoint a lot of users.. While Gionee M2017 does come with its fair share of bells and whistles, it does not and cannot justify the hefty price tag that it comes with. There are much better smartphones available at this price point from stalwarts like Samsung and Apple. If you have a budget of this kind, it would be advisable to go for flagship smartphones from reputed brands.. Gionee M2017 is currently not available in any online store..

Gionee ’s M2017 smartphone was recently spotted on Chinese certification website, Tenaa. The 4G LTE capable smartphone in its images looks like the Galaxy S7 Edge on the front with what appears to be a dual-edge display. On the other hand the rear of the device looks like an old Virtu phone design, but with a Gionee logo and dual rear-cameras.. M2017 sports a 5.7-inch QHD AMOLED display (2560 x 1440 resolution), and features an Octa-core 1.96GHz processor running on 6GB of RAM along with 128GB of on board storage.

An Antutu benchmark of the device shared by PhoneArena shows that the M2017 comes with a Qualcomm 653 processor that is coupled with an Adreno 510.

Gionee has had experience with phones with large battery capacity, including the Marathon series; of which the Marathon M5 comes with a 6000 mAh battery. We reviewed the Marathon M5 and found that it was difficult to finish the charge of the phone even with a heavy day of use, but found it equally difficult to charge the big capacity phone considering how slow it charged.. Gionee Marathon M5 review: One of the best phablets for under Rs 20,000. The listing on Tenaa showed the device to feature just one colour variant, Black. It is not mentioned if the M2017. will be featuring Quick Charge, but as experience would tell; it is important that they do. There has been no official announcement by Gionee on the availability or the pricing of the device yet..

Gionee M2017 with 7,000 mAh battery is out in China. Gionee unleashed the beast in China; M2017 is a smartphone that features a huge 7,000 mAh battery.. The Chinese company is right on schedule as they launched their M2017 smartphone in China. This is a smartphone that comes prepared with two times the battery juice because it features two 3,500 mAh batteries inside.. Aside from this astonishing feature, the M2017 is a monstrous smartphone disguised to look like prince charming with a 155.2 x 77.6 x 10.78mm body that weighs a hefty 238 grams. It also sports a 5.7-inch Quad HD AMOLED display with 2k resolution (2560x1440 pixels), curved edges topped off with sapphire glass.. Under the hood, it has an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 635 SoC partnered with 6GB of RAM and built-in storage options: 128GB or 256GB. Sadly, the device does not have a microSD card slot nor does it have a 3.5mm headset jack but, it does run on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and Amigo 3.5 UI.. In the photography department, the device has a dual rear camera (12MP + 13MP), and 8MP selfie shooter. The M2017 also features a fingerprint scanner out front and has vast connectivity options such as 4G, Bluetooth, GPS, USB Type-C, and Wi-Fi.. The smartphone comes in two colors - black and gold, as well as two back designs: metal and leather. The selling price starts around 6,999 Yuan (1,007 USD). While the top model with Italian custom alligator skin back is priced at 16,999 Yuan (around 2,446 USD).. Gionee has released smartphones with big battery capacities before, but reviews say that is a big hassle when charging because it takes an awful amount of time to get full. Hopefully, this will change with the M2017 and its Quick Charge 3.0 feature.. As of now, there is no news if the M2017 will be sold globally, just stay tuned as we wait for updates on this matter.. Gionee M2017: Smartphone Sophistication in Every Possible Way. A 5.7 inches AMOLED screen with 2K or 2560 x 1440 pixels resolution. A Qualcomm MSM8976 Snapdragon 653 chipset. Using an Octa-Core processor which is a Quad-Core 1.95 GHz Cortex A72. Plus another Quad-Core 1.4 GHz Cortex A53 matched together. And along with an Adreno 510 GPU. A metal body with a leather encasing. Smartphones have become more than utility devices. They have become a part of an individual's lifestyle, an extension of their personal being. And it's not just about hi-tech features; it's about luxury and refinement with the best technology and beyond it. Along with the big names out there, companies like Gionee are extending the competition with phones like their new M2017.. There's a new way in which smartphones are interpreted nowadays. And top-end technology features are only one-half of a success story. With the huge number of products and manufacturers breaking technology limits every other day, the best products have to do a lot more to stand out.. Gionee M2017 has done just that. It boasts nearly whatever technology a phone maker can provide now along with a refined design. Gionee has simply aimed to make a smartphone a class apart from the rest.. These are which make M2017 one of the best available around and definitely close to the benchmark. Superb color saturation and hue are only a few pointers to mention about the display on this Gionee M2017.. This device is comprehensively able to compute anything the user can throw on it without any lag whatsoever. And just to make sure, Gionee has fitted a 6 GB RAM to the whole setup. Internal storage specs come in at 128 GB.. The Dual-lens 6P primary camera can take more than just beautiful picture with intensely rich colors, strong saturation and powerful details. A 12 MP upper lens coupled with a 13 MP lower lens to provide 2x optical zoom along with LED flash and Phase Detection Auto Focus. Adding to this the 2K video taking capabilities, this Gionee M2017 boasts one of the best possible camera setups around.. This is just what this Gionee M2017 is all about. And it is quite obvious that this smartphone weighs in at 238 grams. Dimensions for this model are at 155.2 x 77.6 x 7.4 mm (6.11 x 3.06 x 0.29 inches) but it is easy to hold and use despite the size. A firm confident grip is apparent thanks to its leather wrapped back panel although a metal panel option is also available.. Instead of one battery, two 3500 mAh batteries are working together. And this is a certain benchmark for smartphones. This Gionee M2017 obviously needs all this juice due to its display specs and powerful processors. But, it does provide industry leading backup. It also comes with Quick Charge 3.0 facilities.. The Philippines is still a rising market and affordability, or rather value-for-money is a huge factor to it. But this is a select phone, a luxury smartphone and so it's evident that pricing will not affect this Gionee M2017 much.. There's a high chance that this model will not simply fly off the shelves. It will be available primarily on a delivery-per-order scale. There is no doubt that this smartphone is about excellence as any other can offer at this point. And the absence of similar models of this genre might just give this Gionee M2017 positive sales numbers.. Another Chinese smartphone manufacturer in the long list of companies, Gionee came into being in the year 2002. It is headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China and has grown exponentially to hold a market share of almost 4.7% within a decade of its inception.. The company markets its phones worldwide but has gained prominence in Taiwan, Philippines, Myanmar and the rest of South Asia. Affordability and specifications are key USPs of smartphones sold and manufactured by Gionee.. User Review : 1 Reviews.

Gionee M2017 Price: Two Editions Available. The Gionee M2017 Chinese smartphone is now official and it packs some impressive specs, including 7,000 mAh battery power and 6 GB of RAM.. The 7,000 mAh battery capacity. is the main selling point of this device, and is achieved through two 3,500 mAh battery units. It remains unclear just how Gionee managed to cram two batteries and get them to communicate with each other, but it likely works similarly to how a portable battery pack takes over when the main battery drains.. The intriguing, new Gionee M2017 sports a metal build with a leathery material on its back. The handset sports a 5.7-inch curved AMOLED display. with a QHD resolution (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) and sapphire glass protection for extra scratch resistance.. Oddly enough, the 4G smartphone packs a midrange processor –. a 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 653 –. paired with high-end sidekicks such as Adreno 510 graphics and a solid 6 GB of RAM. The Gionee M2017 further features 128 GB or 256 GB of native storage, dual SIM support, a dual rear camera system comprised of 12- and 13-megapixel cameras, and an 8-megapixel camera on the front.

The 7,000 mAh battery capacity also sports its own smart power management system which, according to Gionee, can deliver up to 25 hours of continuous video playback and more than 915 hours of standby on a single charge. is also in the mix, allowing for fast charging.. On the downside, it's worth noting that the Gionee M2017 does not have a headphone jack either, indicating that the trend Apple started with its iPhone 7. The Gionee M2017 doesn't have a microSD slot either, but that's a smaller problem considering that the base version of the smartphone has 128 GB of native storage space.. The Gionee M2017 comes in Gold and Black color options and is available in two editions. The standard model costs 6,999 yuan, or roughly $1,007, while the more luxurious edition with an Italian custom alligator leather back goes all the way up to 16,999 yuan, or about $2,446.

We are still not sure as to how long it will take for the batteries to charge up despite fast charging and how long the batteries will actually last.. Gionee has been known to produce smartphones with weird features to attract a particular kind of users, and the M 2017 is no different. The Chinese manufacturer’s marathon series has been known for its huge batteries as M5 and M6 Plus models were launched with 6020 mAh batteries. But, the M2017 will break all records in terms of battery life. The phone was recently passed by TENNA, which is China’s regulatory agency and a few details including pictures were leaked. In this review, we take a look at some of these leaked features and take a more detailed look at its rumoured whopping 7000 mAh battery.. The phone has a standard bar shape, but everything else about it has been turned on its head. The screen is a 5.7-inch dual curved display. A lot of manufacturers including OnePlus has been migrating to this kind of display. The screen will be a full HD AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440. This configuration makes it one of the best smartphones in the market. Pictures that were recently leaked shows that the phone has a leather back finish with a metal frame on the top and bottom. There is one central home button on the lower part of the dual curved screen and a camera on the front. The screen itself has a very little bezel. The rear side of the phone has two cameras and a LED flash surrounded by a speaker grille.. The leaked TENNA report shows that the phone has a Snapdragon 653 SoC processor powering the device. The CPU is octo-core, and it is accompanied by an Adreno 510 graphics unit. The phone also has 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. It has not been confirmed yet whether the phone will have additional storage capabilities, although, you will not need much when you have a storage of 128 GB. Rumours have also spread that Gionee is planning to tie up with a popular cloud storage application to provide users with more storage options.. There is still some confusion regarding the processor though as an earlier GeekBench test revealed the processor to be the Helio P10 chip. The results of both the tests haven’t been announced as of yet. We expect that the phone will be able to breeze through common applications and also be able to run a few more demanding apps like Asphalt 8 and some 3D games.. Gionee has made a lot of changes to the cameras on the phone. The front selfie camera will be a massive 8 MP shooter. This will be more than enough for video calling and will also take amazing pictures. However, it is the primary camera, or should we say cameras, that the company has made changes to. There are two primary cameras of 12 MP and 3 MP each. This is not the first time that we are seeing a strange configuration like this, though, Gionee released the S9 with the same configuration a few months ago. The dual camera has the function of producing more depth of field effects giving images more contrast and a better sense of distance. The camera on the S9 made a huge difference in terms of the quality of images. We hope that that the dual camera on the M2017 also does the same.. This is the part of the review we were hoping to get to and the part where we will spend the most time. The marathon series has been known to provide large batteries so that the phone runs as long as it can without needing to charge. The M 2017 will have a huge 7000 mAh battery. The battery will also have fast charging so that it won’t take a long time to fully charge the behemoth. However, how much longer the battery will last is a question. To accommodate the battery, the company had to increase the size of the phone including the screen which will use up a lot of the power. Whatever be the case, we cannot wait to test the battery out for ourselves.. Subscribe for Exclusive Deals & Updates for you.
