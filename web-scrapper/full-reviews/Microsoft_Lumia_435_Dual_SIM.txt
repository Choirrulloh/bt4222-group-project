Lumia 435- The Ultimate Budget Phone!.. Lumia 435 is the latest budget smartphone by Microsoft. It is the cheapest branded smartphone in the world. However, it has a few cons too. 1) Design and Display- It is made of the usual polycarbonate body and its design is similar to that of Lumia 525. Lumia 435 sports a 4 inch capacitive screen which is not vivid enough. It off ers a poor 480 x 800 pixel resolution resulting in a meagre 233 ppi pixel density. The display is just alright but the viewing angles are bad and you may see colours turning upside down while auto rotation. The text is not very crisp and it does not have a clearblack display for sunlight readability. So overall I rate the design and display 3.5/5. 2) Performance and RAM- It boasts a 1.2 Ghz Snapdragon 200 dual core clubbed with 1GB RAM and Adreno 302. Overall, it performs daily tasks smoothly with a few lags which are intermittent. However, it would not be able to handle games like Asphalt 8, Mass Effect 3 well due to poor hardware. But, it multi tasks with ease and provides a good user experience. I would recommend it to only those who need a phone for daily tasks. The graphic chip is outdated but still does well. Hence, overall performance is good except for some stutters. 3) Software and Interface- The good part is that it is a Windows Phone. It comes preinstalled with Windows 8.1 but is upgradable to the upcoming Windows 10 which is very exciting. Windows 10 unifies experience across all platforms. It gives developers an incentive to make apps only for one platform so that the quality and quantity of apps in the Windows Store increase manifold. Windows 10 comes with some great features and animations like the new Notification Centre, redesigned Settings app, camera features of Lumia 930, better animations and an attractive user interface. Customization of tiles, background and a new way to put the photos will just make you love the phone. It will deliver a very smooth experience as the Windows UI is very light and less resource hungry unlike Android. Now, Windows has also introduced the Spartan Project and Cortana-your personal voice assistant which will make your life easy. Also, with Word flow and Action centre, and other minor improvements in UI have made Windows to earn its position again in the market. So, low hardware will be able to do well on the phone. 4) Camera and Storage- It is the worst part of the phone. It comes with a meagre 2MP camera and no secondary camera or flash. So, for photographers and selfie lovers, it is a nightmare. However, it comes with an 8GB internal storage which is upgradeable to 128GB through microSD card. So, you can store lots of music, games, apps, photos, etc with ease as you never run out of storage if you spend a handsome amount on micro SD card. Also you get 30GB of Onedrive storage free. But, it has only accelerometer and proximity sensor to avoid a higher price. Therefore, I rate it 3.5/5 overall. 5) Battery- With the new battery saver feature, even a poor 1560mAh battery lasts a day which is quite good. After heavy gaming, web browsing, video playback, games, etc for 18 hours, we are still left with one more hour. Hence, people hating charge their phones intermittently would love to check this out. Verdict- It is a durable phone and will last for more than a year. Although, it is not future proof due to low hardware but will please you till it works. Microsoft is a great brand and has ensured good quality inside and outside both. However, there is noticeable lag, Uncomfortable form factor, low resolution screen, low hardware and average battery performance which will make you think twice to buy this phone. There is huge competition among budget phones with the newly launched Moto E 2nd Gen, the old Redmi 4S and such other phones. So, at the end of the day, it purely depends on the choice of interface and system software you like. If you are a Windows lover and looking for a budget smartphone, I surely recommend it. Despite, its cons, other things like price, brand value, system software, user interface and good performance make it a good competitor in this range. Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 0 0.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Microsoft Lumia 435 continues the starter smartphone trend. This model is almost like the entry-level Lumia 532, with just a few slight variations.. by January 14, 2015 2:00 AM PST. Microsoft Lumia 435 is almost identical to the Lumia 532. What's the difference between the Microsoft Lumia 435 here and the Microsoft Lumia 532 ? Not much. Both are the same size and have nearly identical hardware components. They also come in the same colors. The main variations, really, come out in the camera and processor.. Microsoft Lumia 532 steps up the Lumia 435. The final word on Microsoft's Band. Where the 532 has a 5-megapixel fixed-focus camera, the 435 has a 2-megapixel fixed-focus shooter. Likewise, the quad-core chipset of the 532 gives way to a 1.2GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor. Oh, and there's no Glance UI on the lock screen to tell you the date and time.. Otherwise, the specs line up almost exactly: a 4-inch 800x400-pixel display, 8GB of internal storage and a removable 1,560mAh battery. It comes in the same colors, too: bright green and orange to shake up more subtle white and black shades. Cases are interchangeable between the two.. The 432 costs €69, which works out to about $81 or £54, while in Australia it's AU$129. For more hardware details, check out CNET's Microsoft Lumia 532 preview.. Microsoft Lumia 435 Dual Sim (black).

Mobile Phones Home Theatre Home Appliances Wearable Tech Networking Coffee machines. Review: Microsoft Lumia 435 Dual SIM Leigh D. Stark 3 years ago Mobile Phones Features Performance. How low can you go? Microsoft answers the question with a new phone that hit the $129 mark, bringing two SIM slots and just enough mobile for people who need something smart and simple.. If you don’t think you need the best phone, but you do need something, the phone manufacturer formerly known as Nokia and now known as Microsoft might have something up its sleeve , provided you can handle Windows Phone 8.1.. The phone is small, offering up a 4 inch display running the old school resolution of 800×480, which offers roughly 233 pixels per inch, 100 below that of the Apple iPhone 6’s Retina display, with support for touch.. Under this display, you’ll find a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 1.2GHz processor, paired with 1GB RAM and 8GB storage, the latter of these upgradeable thanks to a microSD slot found inside the phone. Microsoft makes the phone, and so includes its Windows Phone 8.1 operating system on this handset.. Connections for the handset include 802.11b/g/n Wifi, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, and 3G mobile connectivity, with microUSB 2.0 making the case for wired connectivity on the charge and data transfer side of things.. A 3.5mm headset jack is included, too.. Two microSIM slots are included here, too, making it possible to use two separate phone and data connections if need be, though both will be at most 3G only.. Cameras are found here, too, with a 2 megapixel rear camera with no flash, and a VGA camera up front, making sure there is something if you want to do some video chat or take a selfie.. Few buttons are found on the handset, with physical buttons taken care of via a volume rocker and power button on the right edge, with the three typical soft buttons for Windows below the 4 inch screen, catering to back, home, and search.. The casing for the Lumia 435 is removable, revealing a 1560mAh battery that is also removable.. There are generally three sections of the mobile phone market when it comes to buying one: flagship with its $700 to $1200 options, mid range running from $300 to $699, and then everything else below it being entry level.. Entry level, though, also has its own little divisions. There’s budget bargain bin entry level, offering phones from $49 and higher, and there are prepaid all-rounders that subsidise the cost of the phone by forcing you to go with a telco.. And then there are entry level devices in the $99 to $149 range that don’t, and are open, available for you to insert your SIM — any telco’s SIM — and go for your life, and it’s in that group that we find Microsoft’s Lumia 435 Dual SIM, one of the first phones from Microsoft since the company took over from Nokia in making mobile handsets.. You might look at the handset and go “that’s a Nokia, so why does it say ‘Microsoft’ up top”, and that’s the reason why: Microsoft now makes the Nokia Lumia phones, no longer Nokia, so that’s what’s going on, and that’s what starts the 435 off.. But there’s more to the Lumia 435 than just the Microsoft branding up top.. In the hands, despite the Lumia 435 obviously being made for cheap, it still feels relatively well made, with a fairly thick removable casing that looks like it could be replaced with a different colour if Microsoft decides to release them in stores.. The plastic casing isn’t the sort of quality you can expect out of the older Lumia handsets made by Nokia, and it’s clear this is a less expensive model. That being said, it’s a comfortable albeit edgy design, and when we say edgy, we’re particularly focused on the edges which are pronounced along the sides before leaning into a soft slightly curved back.. We found it comfortable, though the corners can be a bit slippery, and we nearly dropped the phone twice.. Buttons are also here, too, with two physical sets on the side for power and volume, while the main soft buttons along the front are your typical Windows fare for back, home, and search, the latter of which now goes to Microsoft’s Cortana assistant.. But one thing we do need to note is that lack of lights under the buttons, so if you’re using the phone in the dark, you’ll want to remember what does what, because the front buttons do not light up like on other smartphones.. Powering the phone on or returning it from standby is easy, that said, with a simple push on the button on the right edge, and with that the screen will come to life.. As you can well expect, the offering here is a pretty low-end display, with the several year old 800×480 resolution used on an older display with weak viewing angles.. We’re serious when we say the angles aren’t particularly good here, because the colours wash out at any vertical angle and yet hold their own on the horizontal.. The display also leaves a lot to be desired in the whole brightness department, with images that won’t exactly jump off the screen, and just enough colour to see that yes, this is a smartphone that you can look at, browse the web with, listen to music on, and play the odd app or game.. That being said, Microsoft’s Windows Phone 8 is a fairly colour reduced operating system, with an emphasis more on strong colour grids atop black or white, and while the display isn’t great, it’s used well here thanks to that operating system design. On an Android phone, we’d be sceptical, but here on Windows Phone 8, it works.. It’s not great, but it works.. Performance isn’t bad, though, and provided you can deal with the screen, you’ll have a fairly efficient Windows experience, with few slowdowns when you’re scrolling or customising your app menu, loading apps, and jumping from app to app when you hold down on the back button and kick into multi-tasking.. There is a spot of lag here and there, but nothing that’ll raise alarm bells, especially since this is now Microsoft’s lowest priced phone.. Microsoft includes access to Cortana, the Windows Phone answer to Apple’s Siri.. Pages: 1 2. Tags 3G 3G phone Microsoft Windows phone Windows Phone 8. Previous article Review: Microsoft Surface 3.
