Lenovo Phab2 Pro - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 8 9 ». let me know about your experience with this mobile once you have bought it, thanks. I bought it at discount for AED 1,199. It is a good phone , but honestly, there are other better phones out there. Memory Management is not that good. I only have 1.7 gb memory left. Takes lot of time to focus, and many times picture not that great. I guess if you can buy it for cheap, than it's worth it. Deleting messages in bulk not possible. You need to delete one by one.

more ... more .... more ... more .... posted by Maxwell R.. Tags :. Hands-on - Hands-on + Android - Android + Lenovo - Lenovo +. Lenovo made big news during its Keynote Address at Lenovo Tech World. It announced, and had on display, the first smartphone that brings augmented reality to a consumer application, leveraging the platform developed by Google , known until today as Project Tango. The Lenovo Phab2 Pro brings to fruition a project that has been under development for years, and with the announcement of the Phab2 Pro, Google has brought Project Tango into the mainstream, and will henceforth be known as “Tango.” Design There is no getting around this, the Phab2 Pro is a beast. The device will not go down as a smartphone with the world’s largest display, but given the mild contractions we have been seeing with other flagship class devices, the Phab2 Pro stands out. This is a two-handed device, but given the size, it is not at all uncomfortable to hold in the hand. The well-endowed Phab2 Pro has a gently curved back that lets it rest comfortably in the hand. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is located low enough that it is easy to find, which should enable quick muscle memory for users. One thing we are reserving comment about is the micro-USB port on the bottom. We got nothing official, but a Lenovo person with some knowledge about the device made a point about refusing to comment about the apparent lack of a USB-C and that nothing is certain until the product ships. Does that mean there could be some changes before launch? We honestly do not know. We are simply passing along what we were told. It is an aluminum alloy body, with a huge display, and lot of cameras on the back. Did we tell you this thing is big? Display Let us dig into the size a little. The display is a 6.4-inch IPS panel with quad-HD resolution. Aside from the AR functions it is expected to carry out, this thing will be great to watch movies on. There is plenty of real estate and pixel density to make the viewing experience more than adequate. Cameras The Lenovo Phab2 Pro has four cameras. The front facing camera is 8-megapixels, using “big” 1.4µm pixels with an F2.2 aperture. The main camera is 16-megapixels, with fast focus. The other two cameras are really non-user sensors that bring Tango to life. One is a laser-emitter and receiver, used for depth measurements. The other is a fish-eye style lens that assists with motion tracking. In all, the back half of the Phab 2 Pro has a lot going on. Processor and memory Some would argue that the Qualcomm Snapdragion 652 Tango Edition CPU is not worthy of a “flagship” status device. These preproduction units displayed no hiccups, no errors, nothing but smooth performance when we tried out the AR apps that were installed on the devices. The 4,050mAh battery will supply power to this set-up for many, many hours. Details about the tuning of the CPU were not immediately forthcoming, but it is an octa-core SoC mated with the Adreno 510 GPU. It is capable of handling LTE-Advanced in most flavors, and supports Quick Charge 3.0. The CPU is aided by 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of expandable storage. Interface and functionality The interface is not purely stock, but it is pretty close. The notification shade looks like it was lifted straight off a Nexus 6P. The app tray has the same simple layout, and actually, we are glad there is an app tray – so many Chinese brands like to go for the single-layer UI. The biggest difference is in the applications, given that this is a Tango smartphone, so it can support applications no other device can, like Dinos Among Us (more on that later). Pricing, release date, and expectations An exact release date was not announced, only that in September, the Lenovo Phab2 Pro would be globally available, unlocked, and sold through Best Buy in the United States. The best part? This groundbreaking device will retail for only $499. The Lenovo Phab2 Pro is a threshold device not only for Lenovo, but for Google, and of course the developer community. This device, obviously priced to entice broad adoption, brings all the familiar features, and adds a host of others that have not been easily relevant at a consumer level. The Domino World app is plain fun. The Measure It app is plain useful. All are easy to use, educational, and bring something new to smartphones. We are certain there are more than a few of you that are interested in ordering this behemoth as soon as it is available.. Galaxy S9 vs iPhone X hands-on: A battle royale.

Lenovo Phab2 Pro is the first Project Tango phone. Lenovo Phab2 Pro is the first Project Tango phone. At its TechWorld conference Lenovo has not only announced the modular Moto Z and Moto Z Force smartphones but also the first Google Project Tango enabled device, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. The phone provides an Augmented Reality (AR) experience, thanks to its ability to sense 3D-motion and geometry. It can capture 3D-scans of its surroundings and use the data to create 3D-maps, recognize places or track objects. The technology can project virtual effects in real-world spaces, help navigate indoor areas or provide information about objects it has recognized.. To achieve this the Phab2 Pro has a total of four cameras. In addition to the 8MP front module and the 16MP rear camera there are a depth and a motion tracking camera, both also located on the back. Underneath the 6.4" Quad-HD IPS display there is a. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 652 chipset running Android 6.0. 4GB RAM and 64GB of microSD-expandable storage are on board as well, along with a fingerprint reader and Dolby Atmos surround sound technology. All the high-end technology is nicely wrapped up in metal unibody that is available in gold or silver.. The Lenovo Phab2 Pro will be available to purchase online in August and one month later in stores globally. In the US it will cost $499. Lenovo promises that by the time of shipping a special Tango App Store will contain around 25 apps and is planning to expand this number to 100 by the end of the year. The new technology certainly looks promising, and it will be interesting to see. how it catches on with consumers and developers. Additional information on how Tango works on the Phab2 Pro can be found in the Lenovo promotional video below.. Tags: mobile , 3d , android , google , smartphone-news.

Batman used Lucius Fox's cell phone sonar technology to rescue hostages and apprehend Joker. The new ASUS Zen Fon 3 is much more interesting. Nine phone-related articles on Dpreview homepage just now. The vast majority of photos are taken with phones. I apologize that this is the world that you live in. But this is the world that you live in.. Yep, and any McDonald's outlet probably sells more meals per day than any of the world's finest restaurants (with apologies to those who consider McDonald's to be among the finest restaurants).. More bells and whistles to keep you buying the newest, latest and useless gadgets. What's next? A life-sized hologram you can converse with?. So you would like more of the same crap from the past 5 years?. Tech will move on without you. Tango looks very useful to a lot of people.. Hmm, I have just been waiting for real time, hd video phone calls, without tons of dropped frames. Holographic images of those we are calling would be so cool, but I think we really need much more phone/internet bandwidth first. By that I mean sustained bandwidth, not peak (or advertised) bandwidth.. To Ethan P99, Good luck to them. If moving technology got its 'hands' around global climate change, food and water shortages and energy crisis worldwide, I'd be more impressed by that. Some new 'virtual' reality plaything does little to contribute to our civilization. But I suppose it's a cute but useless diversion rather than facing 'real' reality.. What are you doing on a tech-gadget site, Jim?. Technology like this might seem pointless or irrelevant to you, or me, or anyone else, for that matter, but it's these kinds of technologies that can change the ways that people communicate. If people can find new ways to communicate, they will find new ways to innovate. If people can innovate, and they can more easily share their new ideas via technology, more problems can meet solutions. For example: If you can SHOW somebody how to build a water pump from a live 3D model without having to waste the resources it takes to actually go to that person/village you are not only giving that person/village the chance of generating their own clean water supply but saving on carbon footprint at the same time. Augmented reality might be useless in my hands - just a bit of fun - but don't underestimate the technologies behind it and the untapped potential.. Better than talking to a jacket and hat on a chair.... My 'sling' is not directed at advanced technology per se. As a matter of fact, I am an insatiable technology fan and always have been, given my early adult years in aerospace engineering and design. The 'sling' is directed primarily at useless self absorbing gadgets such as 3D imagery with Dolby surround sound in what is after-all a telephone, or more properly a cell phone. And in this case it is a marketing tool to capture 'the must have the latest thing' customer and serves no practical use except to temporarily entertain the user until he or she gets bored and moves on to the next toy. 3D imagery itself is not to be denigrated and is advancing as we speak in the field of big screen and eventually TV entertainment. The current technology remains crude and eye-straining but eventually a breakthrough or two will get us there.. And my 'slumming' remark was admittedly snarky.. Many good selling points here, but the battery is major.. I never understood and agreed on this thin device craze, that dramatically compromises the battery life. Up to the point where the phone is simply to thin to hold.... Good product Lenovo, hope others would follow.. The efficiency of the new 820 chip is really good now that you can have an all day battery with the same capacity battery. Battery life in the newly released flagships with this new chip should not be a worry anymore, especially with new quick chargers.. It has an 820 chip on it. It will last all day if you don't use the phone. If you use it constantly it lasts about 4 hours. I agree, please design phones which one can use for work, meaning last 8+ hours of continuous use, not standby!. BTW - I do love my phone, not knocking it, but lets be realistic, it needs better battery life.. The Nexus 6p has a Sd810. The 810 was plaqued with overheating and battery issues. Know what it has before spitting lies. Btw my S7 has the 820. I've gotten 7 hours 21 minutes of constant use out of it. The 820 is on a whole other level.. My Samsung Note 4 lasts 3-4 days with normal use, including navigation. I've replaced the standard battery with a ZeroLemon 10.000 mAh one. I reckon it could last week's if I switched to the maximum battery saving mode. Of course it's not an option with the later non replaceable battery models :(. A classy looking, technologically interesting device.. But not magical, like Apple phone.. Magical? like an apple phone? you mean 2 years behind like most apples phones.. The battery at the same time has to be this big and also can be this big because the phone has a 6.4" screen...some people would probably call it a tablet :).

Lenovo Phab 2, Phab 2 Plus, Phab 2 Pro hands on. by John Velasco June 9, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. It’s a grand old party for Lenovo, who for the longest time, has been manly focused on selling its smartphones abroad. time has finally come for the company to tackle the US market, a place. that’s still largely uncharted territory for them, despite having acquired Motorola back in 2014.. Anyone can manufacture and sell an Android-based smartphone, but for Lenovo, its success hinges on offering at least a couple key qualities that help to differentiate its stuff from the vast number of players already saturating the market. Thankfully, Lenovo has seemingly delivered just that. Lenovo and Google have been teasing us about what Project Tango is capable of doing for a while now, but at long last, they’ve unveiled the world’s first Tango-enabled smartphone at Lenovo TechWorld 2016.. In addition to the new Tango-powered handset, Lenovo have two other smartphones that are backed with irresistible prices and relatively few compromises considering the asking price.. With the unveiling of its new Phab 2 line, it’ll be interesting to see how much attention Lenovo will get from consumers in the US market.. We have three smartphones in this new line, the Lenovo Phab 2, Phab 2 Plus, and finally, the Tango-ready Phab 2 Pro. For the most part, the trio all share the same fundamental design language. They’re big phones, really big! As the model names imply, they’re phablets meant for people who love big phones – or those who want that bridge form-factor between 7-inch tablets and today’s average sized smartphones.. Part of the reason why they’re all so large is because they’re fashioned with 6.4-inch sized screens, which is plenty of real-estate room to enjoy movies and such. Now, the main differences between them are the materials used for their chassis. Being the entry-level of the bunch, the Phab 2 has a body comprised out of mostly plastic and doesn’t have a fingerprint sensor. A step up from that, the Phab 2 Plus swaps the plastic for metal (aluminum alloy) – while adding that fingerprint sensor as well. And finally, the Phab 2 Pro looks very similar to the Phab 2 Plus, given that it also boasts a metal body, but it has a unibody design with slightly thicker separator lines on the back.. Aesthetically, we wouldn’t say that these designs are necessarily fresh, especially when it looks very much like other metallic phones we’ve seen released this year including. the HTC 10 , the Huawei P9 , and ZTE Axon 7. We’re not drooling over them, but despite that, we’ll give them credit for going with designs that aren’t just ripped directly from Motorola.. As we’ve mentioned already, all three phones boast 6.4-inch sized screens, so there’s a ton of room to enjoy content. Just like their designs, they follow the same premise with their resolutions. With that, you’re going to find a 720p IPS screen with the Phab 2, a better 1080p display. with the Phab 2 Plus, and a pixel crunching Quad-HD IPS display with the Phab 2 Pro.. The resolutions directly relate to their sharpness and detail, as the Phab 2’s 720p screen is pretty light on the fine details, while the Quad HD resolution of the Phab 2 Pro looks exquisitely detailed. Not only does it have the best looking screen out of the bunch, but it features what Lenovo refers to as an “Assertive Display,” which is simply means that it can optimize the image quality depending on the ambient lighting and the kind of content that’s being shown.. You’ve probably already caught on to the. low-mid-high range theme going between these three new smartphones, so don’t be shocked to find the same approach when it comes to processing hardware. The entry-level of the bunch, the Phab 2, features a quad-core MediaTek 8735 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Next up, the Phab 2 Plus gets a small upgrade in the form of a quad-core MediaTek 8783 chip with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of saving memory. And finally, the Phab 2 Pro leverages the Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 (Tango Edition) SoC coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of base storage.. Thankfully, every one of these devices. offers expandable storage thanks to the available microSD card slots they offer. In terms of performance, however, it’s obvious that the Phab 2 Pro has the snappiest operation thanks to the Tango-optimized Snapdragon 652 it’s packing, which is needed for it to run many of the Tango features effectively. Conversely, the Phab 2 and Phab 2 Plus might seem like they’ve been overlooked, but don’t worry because they. to operate relatively fine at least for those with relatively modest needs and expectations.. Now this is where things really get juicy, mainly because the Phab 2 Pro is fashioned with hardware that makes it Tango-ready. On the back, it’s hard to miss the camera modules and sensors that work hand-in-hand for Tango and the vast augmented reality experiences it’s capable of delivering. There are technically three major components that validate it being Tango-ready: a fisheye camera lens to get a wide view of the space, an RGB camera that helps in sensing what’s around the room, and an IR emitter that sends out an IR grid to measure the time of flight, or in laymen’s terms, its helps to measure distance. Needless to say, we’re really excited about this, but we’ll talk more about the Tango experiences in the next section.. As for the other two phones, they carry 13-megapixel cameras with phase detection auto-focus, but the Phab 2 Plus gets an extra jolt because it’s a dual-camera configuration for post-bokeh effects, and offers an f/2.0 aperture lens, laser auto-focus assist, and 1.34 micro pixels.. Love it or hate it, all three phones are running Lenovo’s custom skin on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. That’s not necessarily a bad thing depending on who you talk to, but the more compelling thing here is how the Phab 2 Pro is Tango-ready, giving us a glimpse into the future of augmented reality with our smartphones. While augmented reality is nothing new in the grand scheme of things, Google’s work with Project Tango goes the extra step by giving freedom to AR – no longer restricting it to just a static experience.. What we mean by that is that you can use the Phab 2 Pro in ways that weren’t possible before. We managed to check out some Tango demos, like an upcoming Lowe’s app that provides conceptual ideas of what your future kitchen might look like by visualizing a specific stove, refrigerator, or other appliances right where you intend on putting them in a room. It’s a neat thing if you’re a home decorator especially, since you can visualize where things will go prior to actually buying them.. Another demo was a first person shooter having us destroy these aerial drones floating around the room. Even though we’re still in the early stages of what Tango is capable of, the demo shows us how it can map a room out with its sensors – thus, allowing us to move around the room to track and destroy these aerial drones. It makes us think about the possibility of one day seeing Tango-ready phones strapped into headsets like Google Cardboard, but rather than a stationary experience, we’d be able to move around in space.. We managed to check out several other demos too, like this one demo. that allowed us to play and setup dominos in the AR space, and another dinosaur experience that showcases Tango’s ability to scale appropriately as you’re moving around in space. Overall, however, the software here with the Phab 2 Pro and Tango establishes a new experience that we haven’t seen before. As more developers get on board, we can only imagine getting better, more meaningful experiences.. Tango might be the big hoopla at Lenovo Tech World, but at the same time, it’s also Lenovo’s official foray into the US smartphone market. Better yet, they’re sticking with a firm strategy with the rollout of its Phab 2 line, just because they’re all priced aggressively – $199, $299, and $499 respectively for the Phab 2, Phab 2 Plus, and Phab. All three will be available globally beginning in September, but most likely earlier for the US.. Price-wise, they all have their value. At $199, you’re getting a mighty big phone that should be ample for most users with the Phab 2. Going up from that, the $299 Phab 2 Plus benefits from having a metal body, a fingerprint sensor, and slightly beefed up specs. And lastly, the $499 Phab 2 Pro is still not too shabby given that it has the same specs as any contemporary flagship right now, but it’s the sole device on the market that brilliantly shows off what Tango is capable of delivering..

Tango is fun and full of potential Decent build and display 64GB storage. Could be way too big for some Mediocre battery Camera awful in low light Fingerprint sensor too easily confused with Tango camera No NFC. Get past its size, and the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is an average phone, suitable for daily use. Its Tango camera shows AR's potential on mobile, but it's still too early to make this a must-have phablet.. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Build & Design. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Display & Speakers. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Software, Storage & Communications. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Review Conclusion. Tango is fun and full of potential. Could be way too big for some. Fingerprint sensor too easily confused with Tango camera. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is big, but that’s not the only reason it’s different. It’s the first Android smartphone with Tango, a computer vision technology that uses the Pro’s camera and specialized processing to detect space and positioning.. Think of it as a hyper local and more detail-driven GPS, which recognizes you’re standing three feet from a wall rather than 2.3 miles from the nearest Starbucks. Google hopes Tango will enable better augmented reality (AR) apps, 3D mapping, indoor navigation, all with a better sense of environmental awareness.. We took a Lenovo Phab 2 Pro review unit for a spin to find out if this 6.4-inch Android phablet is good enough to justify its $500 asking price, and to see Tango on a consumer device.. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is a supersized smartphone. It measures 7.1 x 3.5 x 0.4 inches, and weighs .57 pounds. It has a 6.4-inch display, and is closer to a small tablet in size than a smartphone.. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro back panel. There’s a reason there are so few smartphones with displays beyond 5.7 inches. Even with thin bezels, anything larger it’s just too big a screen to fit on a compact device. One-handed operation is impossible, even gripping it with one hand is tough. Using it as a real phone is also extremely awkward. And forget about carrying it in your pocket. This is a backpack or purse kind of device.. The flipside is that the big screen is better for multimedia, productivity, and all the AR goodies Tango offers. This is arguably more important than being able to use a phone with one hand.. Either way, the point is the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is BIG, and you’ll want to test it out in person before committing.. Otherwise, it looks like a standard smartphone. The display has slightly raised glass with standard Android capacitive soft keys on the bottom and an ear speaker and front-facing camera on the top. The back panel is a single piece of gunmetal gray aluminum that extends and flattens around the sides.. The cool aluminum provides a quality impression, and shrugs off fingerprints and smudges very well. Such a big smartphone probably won’t survive many drops, so a case is highly recommended.. A volume rocker and textured power button sit on the right, and the microSD/SIM tray sits on the left. A 3.5mm audio port sits on the top (where it should be), while two speakers sit on the bottom, with a microUSB input in between. Once again, we’re disappointed by another new smartphone shipping without USB Type-C. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro volume rocker and power button. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro SIM tray. The back panel has a slight curve, and houses two antenna stripes, along with the back-facing cameras, sensors, flash, and fingerprint sensor. There are three cameras in total, but only one functions as a traditional shooter. The other two enable Tango’s tricks. The bottom camera is circular, just like the fingerprint sensor directly underneath it. These feel similar and are easy to confuse by touch alone. Too many times we blindly pressed the camera trying to unlock our. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro review unit.. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro’s 6.4-inch display has a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution, resulting a dense 459 pixels per inch. That’s very sharp for a display this size. It’s an LCD IPS, and with it come all the strengths and weaknesses of the technology. Whites are particularly bright, blacks could be deeper. Overall, it lacks the pop and saturation of today’s high-end AMOLED displays , but the difference is slight enough that it’s only apparent in a direct comparison.. The display is also plenty bright at max setting, and while glare is persistent, it’s easy enough to see outdoors as to not be rendered useless.. Here’s the standard smartphone boilerplate: smartphone displays range from good to great. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is a small step below the market’s best ( iPhones and Galaxies).. We had high hopes for the speakers, given the device’s size. They prove adequate, which is perhaps the best thing we can say about smartphone speakers (they are generally awful across devices). The sound is pleasant and balanced, though flat overall. Sound volume is appropriate for personal use.. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro has an eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor (1.8 GHz), along with 4GB RAM and 64GB capacity. This is a midrange chipset that sits below the Snapdragon 820 found on the late 2015 and early 2016 flagships, and closer to the 810. It also has Adreno 510 graphics, which is even slower compared against the 820’s Adreno 530.. In real-world usage, it performs well. It’s stable, at least when running non-Tango apps (more on that below). Lenovo Phab 2 Pro review unit handled everything we threw at it, including demanding games like Modern Combat 5. It’s 4GB RAM goes a long way when dealing with open browser tabs and switching between apps. The fingerprint sensor was reliable in testing as well.. Comparing it against more powerful smartphones reveals the chipset’s limitations. The Google Pixel XL, with its Snapdragon 821, is a far smoother smartphone, which is most evident moving from the lock screen to the home screen. In fact, our Lenovo Phab 2 Pro review unit would reboot to the startup screen after unlocking, following a power cycle. It happened too consistently to be a bug, and proved annoying.. Other than that, there’s little functional difference between the 652 and more powerful chips outside of the fluid aesthetic. It’s an acceptable trade off given the price difference between the two devices.. Geekbench 4 is a cross-platform benchmark that measures overall performance. AnTuTu is a cross platform benchmark that measures overall system performance.. AnTuTu 3D is a cross-platform benchmark that measures graphical performance. AnTuTu CPU is a cross- platform benchmark that measures complex app and multitasking performance. AnTuTu RAM is a cross-platform benchmark that measures system speed. AnTuTu UX is a cross-platform benchmark that measures user experience. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro ships with 64GB storage, with about 7GB taken up out of the box. Most other Android smartphone have 8GB or 9GB taken up, so we’re pleased with Lenovo. In fact, we’ll even let the useless bloatware slide (McAfee Security, SYNCit, Accuweather), also because it can be uninstalled. If 64GB isn’t enough, it also supports microSD expansion.. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro OS is very close to stock Android. We were hard-pressed to find any major tweaks or changes. It ships with Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow), and as of this writing (December 2016), it has the August 1 Android security patch level. Marshmallow is a fine Android version, but we’re getting antsy waiting for Nougat to become the default for new smartphones. It also should have a more recent security patch.. This is a GSM unlocked smartphone , meaning it will work on T-Mobile and AT&T in the US, and should have no trouble connecting overseas. Sprint and Verizon customers are out of luck.. It supports 802.11 b/g/n/ac dual-band Wi-Fi, along with Bluetooth 4.0. There’s no NFC, which should be standard on all Android smartphones, so no tap-to-pay.. With a large 4050 mAh battery, you would think the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro has all-day battery life. Streaming Netflix over Wi-Fi with the screen brightness set to max, our Lenovo Phab 2 Pro lasted 6 hours 40 minutes. The cutoff for this test is eight hours. Anything better is good ( with some topping 20 hours ), anything worse is bad.. It supports Qualcomm Quick Charge, fortunately. We were able to get 45% from a dead battery after charging for 30 minutes.. Tango is impressive, and AR technology is extremely versatile. Pokemon Go showed AR’s potential as a basis for gaming, Tango can take that steps further.. Imagine popping the hood of your car and holding your phone over it to reveal a digital overlay with directions on how to change spark plugs. Or maybe looking at a city block from the street, with restaurant and shop info hovering over respective locations. Theme parks could use it for the same, or hospitals and shopping centers for indoor mapping. In the home, it could be used for home improvement projects, or rearrange furniture.. Some of the new Tango apps do just that. Lowe’s Vision is a surprisingly robust standout, and Google Measure and MagicPlan offer similar utility. There are numerous home apps, with the selection almost doubling in the two weeks we tested our Lenovo Phab 2 Pro review unit.. Gaming is more limited on Tango, with simple AR overlay games dominating, along with a few more immersive offerings. Hot Wheels Track Builder appeals to the five-year kid in all of us, while Domino World is arguably the best. It’s a sandbox game with multiple options for setting up and knocking over dominoes. It’s easy to use, but deep enough for extremely creative domino setups. Plus, listening to the dominoes fall is very satisfying.. Other apps center around AR sandboxes, AR pets, and silly AR demos. The 3D scanning app Scenes shows Tango’s use outside AR, as does Signal Mapper (for visualizing Wi-Fi signal strength in a given area). We also liked Wally Virtual Notes’ potential. It enables users to leave AR notes for users in specific locations. We can see a workplace using it to help new employees get acclimated to the office.. Silly Tango Holo app with AR Gorilla and Santa Claus. As with any new platform, Tango on the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro has plenty of bugs and limitations. We experienced frequent freezes and slowdowns with some apps, and infrequent crashes with others. The AR can also get wonky. Though it works great in open room with four walls, clutter throws it off, resulting in some odd clipping effects.. Given Tango’s potential, it’s too bad the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro has such a mediocre camera. It’s a 16-megapixel rear shooter, with and f/2.2 aperture. While that’s decent resolution, the aperture is not wide enough for acceptable low-light performance. Anything less than f/2 on non-budget cameras is disappointing (smaller aperture is represented by a larger number). See our Google Pixel XL review for an explainer on this particular spec.. The sample pics from our Lenovo Phab 2 Pro review unit aren’t so bad in adequate lighting. Details are present, and colors pop. Contrast could be deeper, but we’ve seen much worse from other recent smartphones. We also liked the simple AR options in the camera app, like the kitty in the bottom picture.. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro sample pic with AR kitty. Low-light without a flash kills any quality, however. Compare the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro to the current low-light king, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. Both pictures were taken at the same time in the same low-light situation. You can’t even see the dog In the Phab 2 Pro’s pic, while the S7 edge barely makes her out.. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro low-light pic. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge low-light pic. Again, the S7 edge is the best in low light by a mile. Still, it’s eight months old, and it’s not unreasonable to expect new smartphones to approach its performance level.. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is $500, which is appropriate given flagships hover north of $700. It’s also different from the pack, with its large size and Tango camera.. That makes is a niche device, something “geeky” for early adopters. Get past its size, and it functions fine as a daily driver, with acceptable performance. Battery life isn’t good, but it’s not crippling. And the camera is passable in most lighting situations. Low-light shooters will have to get by with the harsh flash.. At the very least, Tango is a neat party trick. “Look at what my phone can do!” While it’s still too new to offer must-have utility, it’s brimming with potential. In fact, that could take it beyond mobile VR , which could seem frivolous in comparison..

Trending >> Earbuds that will improve your hearing. >> A camera for your neck. >> Aibo's back and better than ever. Gives you a taste of Augmented Reality, but not much more. We are part of The Trust Project. We all want our smartphones filled with groundbreaking tech - but that can either be the kind that's perfect for everyday use, or something that isn't quite as useful,. but demonstrates plenty of potential to bridge a technological gap in our lives.. Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro falls into the latter category. It's the world's first smartphone with Project Tango, Google's foray into Augmented Reality (AR).. Haven't we seen this all before? Well, yes and no. It sounds a lot like the setup you'll find in. Intel RealSense camera setup, and could do clever stuff like measuring objects just by pointing the lens at them.. Lenovo's version fits in your pocket, but is the Phab 2 Pro just as gimmicky - or does it do enough to make us rethink how we use AR?. For such cutting edge tech, the Phab2 Pro is a surprisingly affordable US$499. Just keep in mind that it only has the guts of a mid-range phone, though.. There's a Snapdragon 652 CPU running the show, paired with 4GB of RAM. It's an octa-core chip, but clock speeds aren't the highest - which begs the question: is the Phab2 Pro underpowered?. With modest Geekbench scores of 1474 (single-core) and 3540 (multi-core), it gets the job done on paper. In real world use too, the phone is zippy enough to get you through your daily routine without any noticeable lag or slowdown.. Loading up a Tango-enabled app does, however, feel a little on the slow side. The experience is generally fine once you're using it though, so we're not too worried. 3D models are rendered quickly enough and it doesn't feel too sluggish, albeit barely – but more on that later.. On first impressions at least, it doesn't give me the confidence that the next generation of apps will run smoothly on it.. You get 64GB of on-board storage, and there's a microSD card slot too, so you won't run out of space in a hurry. Like most other phones, though, the slot also accommodates a second SIM card, meaning that it's shared. Performance aside, the Phab 2 Pro otherwise feels like a premium phone. There's nary a flaw on its body, and they took the effort to chamfer and polish the edges perfectly, even on the USB port – now that's premium-level effort for you.. The 6.4in, 2560x1440 display certainly adds to the upmarket feel, and it's a real visual treat. Lenovo has picked an LCD panel, so while contrast and black levels won't rival OLED screens from Samsung, it still looks sharp and has great viewing angles.. Dolby Atmos is along for the ride, too, tweaking the sound EQ and letting you record multi-channel audio using the built-in microphones. The external speaker is loud and clear as well.. However, the ergonomics, size and weight aren't quite singing the same song.. Nothing can disguise the fact that this is a rather bulky and heavy phone - I couldn't change volume and then use the fingerprint sensor without changing my grip first. You just can't reach it all, and it slides off non-flat surfaces easily when you put it down.. It would be tricky to make the phone any slimmer though, seeing as it's packed with cameras and sensors.. You get an RGB camera, a time-of-flight camera, a motion-tracking camera, and an IR depth sensor, in addition to the usual array of motion sensors to make Tango possible.. The large, 4050mAh battery probably didn't help, either - but it does let you go for well over a day between charges. Stay away from power-intensive apps, and the Tango AR modes, and you'll be waking up on day three with a small amount of juice left.. If I'm honest, I wasn't expecting much from the Phab 2 Pro's main camera. A 16MP sensor and phase detection autofocus should do a respectable job, so with those expectations in mind, I wasn't disappointed.. You get decent enough results in daylight, but things aren't so great at night.. However, you should note that it struggles to focus when lighting conditions aren't optimal, so you have to be selective about your subject matter and composition. You'll have a better time if you choose a clear focal point, or compose the picture so that it's not difficult for the autofocus to figure out what you want to do.. Image quality is decent enough, provided you have the right amount of light.. In low light, the algorithm is rather heavy-handed; while the images aren't grainy at all, it does come at the cost of detail.. Despite the camera-heavy nature of the Phab 2 Pro, it seems that the photography element wasn't quite high on the agenda. Its focus speed of 0.3 seconds was touted as a feature, but in practice, it felt no faster than most cameras.. 16MP rear, with 0.3s focus, phase-detect AF & twin LED flash, 8MP front. Lenovo Phab2 Pro review A low-cost, low-risk way to try out AR, but you need to put up with the compromises. Cutting edge tech at mid-tier price. Mid-range CPU cutting it close for AR.

NEWS l l. EVENTS l l. RESEARCH l l. Lenovo launches Phab2 Pro smartphone with Google’s Tango technology. Jordan Novet @jordannovet June 9, 2016 10:39 AM. Above: Lenovo's Phab2 Pro smartphone, in Champagne gold, left, or gunmetal gray.. The real cost of mining Ethereum. Walmart’s problem isn’t Amazon — it’s a lack of interest in who its customers are. Microsoft releases new Windows 10 preview with more proactive Windows Update. At its Lenovo Tech World event in San Francisco today, Lenovo is pulling the covers off three smartphones under the new Phab2 moniker. One of them, the $499 Phab2 Pro, is the first consumer-oriented smartphone to package up Google’s Project Tango augmented reality (AR) technology. It’s something that Google has been working on with Lenovo for several months .. Lenovo is also launching the $299 Phab2 Plus that features dual 13-megapixel rear cameras, a Fujitsu Milbeaut image signal processor — a component also found in some Leica cameras — and manual mode. Also new today is the $199 Phab2.. These are all big phones — phablets, really, or just phabs — with displays spanning 6.4 inches diagonally. At that size they’ll have more screen real estate than the now retired 5.96-inch Nexus 6, the 5.7-inch Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+, and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6S Plus. (My colleague Evan Blass correctly predicted the size, name, and Tango functionality of the Phab2 Pro in a tweet earlier this week.). But besides being big, these phones will be able to stand out on the smartphone market by virtue of their AR capability. Only the Phab2 Pro supports Google’s Tango technology, though. It also comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 chip tuned especially for Tango.. Dual-lens cameras are also still a novelty, although they are not without precedent — see Huawei’s P9 for example, and before that, the HTC One M8 .. So the real question is whether AR will become the cool new thing for a phone to do out of the box. Lenovo has certainly placed a bet on the technology. As for Google, it has been working on mobile AR for the past four years, but the company has also been advancing mobile virtual reality (VR), first with the Cardboard headset and more recently with the Daydream platform. Interestingly Google did not specifically mention Lenovo when it identified some of the companies working on Daydream-ready phones. Lenovo’s marketing materials say that the Phab2 phones are Daydream-ready.. Still, being the first to productize Tango for the public, not just developers , does count for something. Now would be a good idea to reflect on the fact that Lenovo and Google have some history together. The former bought Motorola Mobility from the latter in 2014. If the Phab2 — particularly the Pro — takes off, that $3 billion deal may end up looking smarter in hindsight.. Above: A close-up of the Phab2 Pro.. Here are the specs for the new Phab2 phones:.

Esto también se puede leer en español.. Google's Tango phone, the Lenovo Phab2 Pro, is coming in November. Clay Bavor, head of VR and AR at Google, has confirmed the release date of the first phone with Google's depth-sensing 3D camera system.. October 4, 2016 6:49 PM PDT. Google's first ready-to-buy Tango phone will go on sale in November, according to Clay Bavor, head of VR and AR at Google.. 2016 is set to be a very big year for Google phones. The search giant just announced two new Pixel phones to compete with the Apple iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy models. But if you're in the market for a new phone this November with the latest Google tech, you may have a hard decision ahead.. Remember the Lenovo Phab2 Pro , the huge 6.4-inch phone with Google's Tango depth-sensing 3D camera system that scans the world around you, can play augmented reality games, help navigate indoors, or see how new furniture and appliances might fit in your home? It's coming next month, according to Google.. Update, November 1: It's here, but it may not ship until December. One more delay for the phone.. Though the phone was originally supposed to ship in the summer , and later got delayed to September and then a nebulous "fall," Clay Bavor, head of VR at Google, confirmed to CNET that the phone will go on sale this November. (Yes, that's the same month as Google's Pixel phones.) The Phab2 Pro should sell for $499 unlocked in the United States, equivalent to £345 or AU$672.. It's important to note that only the Google Pixel phones will be compatible with the Daydream VR headset , not the Phab2 Pro. (It doesn't have the required AMOLED screen to support smooth VR.) That means tech enthusiasts will have to choose between virtual reality and augmented reality if they buy a new Google phone next month.. That might not always be the case, though. "You can imagine in the future you won't have to make a choice, but that's a bit further out," said Bavor, hinting that a single phone might eventually support both the Tango and Daydream platforms.. PT: Noted that the phone had previously been delayed from September to "fall".. Be respectful, keep it clean and stay on topic.

This is a BETA experience. You may opt-out by clicking here. I write about disruptive companies, technologies and usage models. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. ’s Project Tango has been one of Google’s longest running projects that had yet to deliver an actual product, until now. -based Project Tango augmented reality devkit tablet almost exactly 2 years ago. At that time, NVIDIA was the only partner developing Project Tango devices, but later on both. announced that they would also be developing reference devices as well. Then, earlier this year, Lenovo announced that they would be the first to deliver a Project Tango device working with Google in the summer. At Google IO there was lots of talk about Project Tango, but no new devices announced and here we are at. Tech World and Lenovo is showing off their new Tango Phablet, the PHAB2 Pro.. Right now, there are a lot of different augmented reality (AR) headsets and goggles being used for AR with many of the applications being targeted towards enterprise customers. The problem with many of these solutions is that they use lots of proprietary technology and require you to buy into an ecosystem that may have a questionable future. This is contrary to Google’s approach with Tango, where they have an open project that incorporates companies from every angle of the enterprise ecosystem and include chip companies and OEMs as well. By involving so many partners in Tango, Google is able to make it stronger by having more companies working together on a common goal. This is a very Google approach to creating a new platform and ecosystem around AR. However, AR itself isn’t limited to enterprise-only applications with apps like Snapchat already heavily utilizing AR for consumers fully contained within an app. For every enterprise application, there could possibly be two consumer applications that just haven’t been developed yet. Enterprise is simply seeing the benefits of AR faster than many consumer companies and are willing to eat the high-cost of earlier devices.. Tango requires more sensors than the standard smartphone, including a fisheye camera and depth sensor. Because of this, many off-the-shelf smartphones and tablets simply aren’t compatible for Tango. OEMs need to intentionally build devices with the right sensors to support Project Tango. These OEMs, like Lenovo, also have to hit minimum requirements set by Google for Tango like meeting the 50 µs processing and time stamping of sensor data. This enables a smooth experience between all the different cameras and sensors and to properly render and overlay graphical data over the environment to deliver a quality and consistent AR experience. Without the adherence to the 50 µs timestamp intervals for all of the subsystems, the Tango algorithms are unable to properly fuse together all of the sensor data in a way that delivers a seamless AR experience.. Lenovo’s PHAB2 Pro is a 6.44” high-end phablet device with a high resolution 2560 x 1440 display that utilizes Tango and is a three-way collaboration between Google, Lenovo and. This obviously means that the PHAB2 Pro is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, however, it does not need to have a Snapdragon 820 in order to be able to work with Tango. The PHAB2 Pro actually sports Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 652 processor, which is commonly found in middle to high tier devices and is usually substituted in place of the Snapdragon 820 in developing markets. The Snapdragon 652 has an 8-Core CPU configuration with four A72 and four A53 cores, making it more than ample in terms of CPU power and with an Adreno 510 GPU as well as. The Snapdragon 652 is also optimized for Tango, which comes from Qualcomm’s relationship with Google on Tango and helps enables them to hit the mandatory requirements for Tango devices. They are also able to do everything that Tango requires in a single integrated SoC without any co-processors, which translates to lower power, higher performance and better thermals than other non-integrated solutions. Because Lenovo opted for the Snapdragon 652, the PHAB2 Pro is able to be well within the 50 µs time stamping requirement for Tango. This is thanks to Qualcomm’s tight software and hardware integration along with their close cooperation with Google and Lenovo.. It seems that part of the reason for Lenovo picking the Snapdragon 652 was to enable Tango capabilities while keeping a reasonable price for their phablet device. Lenovo is pricing the PHAB2 Pro at $499, which is less than what most flagship smartphones sell for today without that capability. This means that Lenovo is trying to enable Tango at a lower price point that can be more affordable than the current $649 flagship smartphone or phablet. Lenovo aimed for a no-compromise phablet design with the PHAB2 Pro while also trying to hit the $499 price point, which makes it all the more impressive and the Snapdragon 652 more appropriate. The low price point is extremely attractive because it lowers the barrier of entry into AR, which used to cost $1,000+ and up, per device. This brings Tango much more within the realm of consumer feasibility and not only limited to enterprise adoption.. The Lenovo PHAB2 Pro looks like it has a lot of potential with both consumers and the enterprise. I could see the PHAB2 Pro being used for a multitude of applications that are already common in the AR world. Because of the size and performance of the PHAB2 Pro, I could see this device being popular with people who need a bigger screen for their AR applications, like indoor mapping or rendering 3D objects inside of a space for things like furniture. The applications for AR are quite vast and encompassing, but for one of the first devices, I expect that the first adopters will be developers who want to see the full capabilities of Tango in a commercial device. Once developers are aware of what Tango can really do in a shipping consumer device, businesses and consumers will start to gravitate towards the best applications of AR using Tango..

With the world's first smartphone compatible with Google's sensory awareness platform, Lenovo aims to court more businesses to use augmented reality.. | June 9, 2016 -- 17:53 GMT (01:53 GMT+08:00). Lenovo is hoping to court more businesses to use augmented reality with a smartphone called the Phab 2 Pro, a device that falls under Google's Project Tango, now just Tango, banner.. The much-anticipated device is the world's first smartphone compatible with Google's sensory awareness platform. Calling the device "flagship worthy," Lenovo Vice President Jeff Meredith noted that it will be globally available beginning in September for just $499 unlocked.. The phone features a 6.4-inch IPS display, "great for video viewing," Meredith said. It also features Dolby's 5.1 audio capture, enabling users to record true-to-life audio.. "We know the market for AR and VR devices is set to explode," Meredith said at Lenovo Tech World in San Fancisco. Yet for any technology to move toward broadscale adoption, it must have some real-world relevancy.. "We truly believe Tango can achieve this level of relevancy," Meredith said. With Google, he said, Lenovo has created a device "that could become so pervasive that you would take it for granted.". Indeed, Lenovo's pricing may put Tango in more hands. Lenovo touted the Phab 2 Pro as a champion device. At the least, Lenovo has produced a good value and pricing that rhymes with what is delivered with its Moto brand.. Announced in February 2014 by Google's Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group, Project Tango uses a depth-sensing camera array to track the 3D motion of the device, map out the surrounding environment and create on-phone augmented reality.. At Lenovo Tech World, Google's Johnny Lee announced that the technology will now be referred to as just "Tango.".

Research firms like Forrester are upbeat about the future of VR and AR. While VR will open up new opportunities for businesses to engage with customers and train employees, Forrester forecasts that AR will gain traction within the U.S. As many as 14 million workers, or 8 percent of U.S. employees, will use smart glasses by 2025, the research firm has predicted.. Lenovo and their partners highlighted one immediate and obvious business application for the Phab 2 Pro: home furnishing. Using Tango's indoor navigation capabilities, you could try "putting a piece of furniture, a virtual object, into your living room to see how it fits," Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing explained.. With the help of Nicole Curtis, the host of HGTV's Rehab Addict, Lenovo demonstrated how to use an app from Lowe's on the Phab 2 Pro.
