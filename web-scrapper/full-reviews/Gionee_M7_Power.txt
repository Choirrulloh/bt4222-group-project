Gionee Android Announcement. Just two days after the official launch of the M7 , Gionee announced another phone from the same series named M7 Power at the Thailand Mobile Expo 2017. It has a massive 5,000 mAh power cell, but is otherwise less powerful than the Gionee M7.. The Gionee M7 Power has a Snapdragon 435 SoC with octa-core 1.4 GHz processor. It is paired with 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage, and there is a microSD slot for expanding it by up to 256 GB. You do get dual SIM support but one of the slots is a hybrid one so you get either a second line or memory expansion, but not both.. The display is 6 in diagonal with 18:9 ratio and offers HD+ resolution or 1440 x 720 pixels. It means there are no buttons on the front, only a tiny bezel on top and bottom. Over the screen an 8 MP selfie camera is positioned, while the main one on the back has 13 MP sensor.. The Gionee M7 Power is priced at THB9,990 ($299) and is offered in dark blue, black and gold.. Gionee M7 is official with FullVision screen and dual cameras. Gionee is announcing the M7 Power with FullView display on September 28. Gionee A1 Lite goes on sale in India tomorrow. I don't know where is recycle bin or trash is situated.because when I deleted my picture it writes "move to trash".. Big 6" screen and big 5000 mAh battery is definitely good. Sadly, those are the only good things. That lowend crap CPU really sucks, and coming from a back alley manufacturer's like Gionee... Why not spend a little bit more and get the Lenovo P2 instead?.

Aditya Shenoy , 30 November 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Gionee M7 Power sports a 5000mAh battery. It is powered by a Snapdragon 435 SoC and has 4GB of RAM. It runs Amigo 5.0 UI on top of Android Nougat. Gionee M7 Power design Gionee M7 Power specifications and features Gionee M7 Power performance, battery life, and cameras. So far in 2017, we have seen a shift in smartphone design, with more and more manufacturers slowly moving towards 18:9 displays. narrower borders around a phone's screen, giving it a near bezel-less look. to go with the trend, with the Gionee M7 Power. The advantage as a consumer is that you get one more smartphone to choose from in the sub Rs. What is different with this phone in particular, is that it has a. big battery as well as a big screen. Gionee’s Power models are well known. for their long battery life, and the M7 Power seems to have what it takes to. We put the Gionee M7 Power to the test to see exactly what it has on offer.. Gionee M7 Power's big 6-inch display has an 18:9 aspect ratio and. Gionee has used an IPS panel and so the phone reproduces colours well and has good viewing angles. The tall screen has thin borders on the sides but the top and bottom are relatively thicker. for its branding, placing the fingerprint scanner at the back and using on-screen navigation buttons. The fingerprint scanner is quick to. unlock the device, but we found its positioning - and that of the the volume buttons on the right -. a bit too high, which means you may find yourself. Gionee has rounded off the corners, while the edges. have been chamfered to make this phone. Its flat metal back hides a 5000mAh battery, while the plastic caps at the top and the bottom eliminate the need for antenna lines. Thanks to its big battery, the Gionee. its presence felt in your hand. The band that runs around the sides is made of plastic but the power and volume buttons have a metallic feel to them.. You get a single speaker positioned alongside the 3.5mm headphone jack and Micro-USB. Gionee has also added an Infrared emitter on the top,. which can be used to control compatible appliances.. The Gionee M7 uses a Snapdragon 435 SoC, which has eight Cortex-A53 cores and is known to be efficient. ( Review ) and the LG Q6 ( Review ) are powered by the same processor. 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage which is expandable by to 256GB using the Hybrid dual-SIM slot.. The phone has two Nano-SIM slots, one of which. There is support for 4G and VoLTE on both SIMs. but only one at a time. You get Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, and USB-OTG.. Gionee ships its own Amigo 5.0 UI on top of Android Nougat. The UI has been tweaked since we reviewed the Gionee A1 Plus , and the quick settings are now accessible by swiping down from the notification area instead of the iOS-like Command Centre. You don’t get an app drawer and all icons are available right on the homescreen. The settings app is customised to some extent, which might take some time getting used to. All custom features on the M7 Power are grouped separately allowing you to explore them in one go.. Just like older Gionee phones, gesture control is built in, allowing you to double-tap to wake the phone or draw alphabets when the screen is off to launch apps. There is an App Clone option as well, which lets. you run two instances of the same app. You can also put the big battery of the M7 Power to use by enabling reverse charging and plug other devices in like you would with a power bank.. Private Space is yet another addition to the software. It lets you hide contacts, messages, notes and call recordings using a separate fingerprint or passcode. This space can be accessed from the lockscreen by using the particular fingerprint, or by doing a two-finger swipe in the aforementioned apps.. There is significant bloatware preinstalled on the phone, including UC News, Xender, Gaana, Messenger, Truecaller, Flipkart and demo versions of a few games. Thankfully, you can uninstall these to free up some space and. We found the hardware on the M7 Power to be good and did not face any lag. during the duration of our testing. The processor manages to run apps and games well enough. Having 4GB of RAM is a good advantage and the M7 Power. makes the most of it by holding apps in memory when not actively used. Relaunch times are quite good as a result.. The processor isn't exactly entry-level, but it does come in below. the options more commonly seen at this price level. We ran Antutu and managed to score 45,682 points, while Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests gave us 679 and 2,590 respectively. During our use, the big battery on the phone went on for a whole day with medium to heavy use with still around 50 percent left at the end. In our HD video loop test, the M7 Power managed to go on for close to 17 hours.. Gionee has equipped the M7 Power with a 13-megapixel rear camera and a single LED flash and an 8-megapixel selfie camera. The camera app is basic and has different shooting modes to choose from. Apart from the usual Photo, Video and Panorama modes there is Face Beauty, Group Selfie and a Card Scanner mode. You also have different settings and a professional mode which lets you individually control different parameters of the camera. switches to night mode and toggles HDR automatically based on lighting conditions. Gionee has also added a 2x zoom control in the camera app, which is done digitally.. Photos taken in daylight are sharp and have a good amount of detail, but you can see grain. Auto HDR does help in getting. better output if you are patient, but we did notice that the phone struggled with metering. Low-light photos are average - the phone manages to keep. low but at the cost of detail.. Tap to see full-sized Gionee M7 Power camera samples. Selfies are strictly average, and those taken indoors look grainy. The M7 Power has a 3D Photo option which requires you to move the camera around an. object to capture it in 3D. These didn’t turn out great and it looked like the phone records a short video while allowing you to scrub through it. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for both the cameras, and you also have the option to record slow-motion video.. Verdict The Gionee M7 Power is a good smartphone but at Rs. 16,999, it does seem to be. We were impressed with the battery life, but the UI and the cameras don't live up to the standard set by the competition. Around this price, all rounders like the. would be more obvious picks for most buyers. if battery life is your number one priority, then the Gionee M7 Power would be a better choice..

Gionee M7 Power review: Buy it for the battery Avani Bagga | Gadgets Now | Updated: Nov 24, 2017, 12.42PM IST. Gionee recently launched its M7 Power smartphone in India. Priced at Rs 16,999, the smartphones comes with a bezel-less display and a 5000mAh battery.. *Lasting battery *Sturdy built *Smooth performance. 2017 seems to be the year of bezel- less smartphones. Almost every brand seems to be in a rush to launch its own bezel-less device. Not to be left behind, Gionee too has joined this bandwagon with its M7 Power smartphone. The device has a big battery – one of its highlights – and on paper most of the other specifications looks like they mean business. and other specifications seem to be good on paper too. With a price tag of Rs 16,999, is it a smartphone that is worth buying? But is it worth a buy at a price of Rs 16,999? Read the rest of our review to find out…. Gionee M7 Power is made of aluminium and the front panel is dominated by the bezel-less display. The metal clad body coupled with the edge- to- edge display does give it a futuristic look, but somehow, we were more impressed with its build quality than we were with its design. The diamond-like lustre on the smartphone’s textured back panel and the thick edges make it look a bit chunky. If you like flashy looking gadgets then you may just like the look of it. You may like it, but personally we prefer phones that come with a more minimalistic look and feel, so the M7 Power didn’t really leave a lasting impression.. The textured back panel of the Gionee M7 Power isn’t impressive for multiple reasons. To begin with, the smartphone has three kinds of textures on the back: there is a glass strip on the top where the rear camera and LED flash can be found; below it is the glossy texture and finally there’s a plastic like material below that as well. One can’t fault Gionee for putting in a lot of effort on the smartphone’s design and look. However, the end result somehow is rather mundane. One thing that we didn’t like about Gionee’s M7 Power is the textured back panel. Firstly, the smartphone has three kinds of textures on its back. There is a strip of glass on top on which the rear camera and LED flash are placed. Below it glossy texture we mentioned earlier and below that is a plastic-like material. Although it seems like the company has put in some effort to make the smartphone look good, the end result seemed mundane.. This is not to say that the brand hasn’t got things right with the design and look. The build quality of M7 Power is sturdy and impressive which also makes it heavy at 199 grams. With 8.6mm edges, this is a slightly thicker looking smartphone compared to a few others. If thicker looking devices are what you prefer then this is certainly a good option to consider.. However, we must add that we were far more impressed by the built quality of the Gionee M7 Power. The smartphone comes with a sturdy built quality and feels heavy to hold at 199 grams. It is also quite thick compared to others smartphones with 8.6mm edges. If thin smartphones are not your thing, you would certainly like the device. The edges of the smartphone house a 3.5mm jack, charging slot and speaker grilles at the bottom, power and volume rocker buttons on the right and SIM tray on left.. The front panel remains dominated by the 6-inch HD + display of the smartphone. The colours get a bit saturated but overall, it’s consistent at different viewing angles. Using the smartphone under direct sunlight wasn’t a problem either. Gionee M7 Power comes with 18:9 aspect ratio which makes watching videos and other multimedia a good experience. The on-screen navigation keys on the display work fine as well. The display of the M7 Power is certainly satisfactory. We found the display to be decent. The colours were a bit saturated, but remained consistent at different viewing angles. Sunlight readability was not a problem – something that we consider to be a plus. Thanks to the 18:9 aspect ratio, watching videos and the multimedia was a good experience. The display also had on-screen navigation keys. Apart from the display, the front panel was is also home to the earpiece and the selfie camera of the smartphone.. Gionee M7 Power smartphone runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system with Amigo 5.0 skin on top. It is powered by a 1.4GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor paired with 4GB of RAM. For storage, it offers 64GB ROM and a microSD card support of up to 256GB. For imaging duties, the smartphone comes with a 13MP camera at the rear with an aperture of f/2.0 and an 8MP facing camera with an aperture of f/2.2. The device houses a 5000mAh battery with fast charging and offers the device offers 4G, VoLTE, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFC as connectivity options.. Speaking of the UI of the smartphone, Gionee M7 Power does come with customizations. For instance, the app icons are different from other Android devices, the settings Settings shortcuts in notification panel is tweaked and the smartphone has a number of pre-installed apps. These include Flipkart, UC NEs, Truecaller, Gaana, TouchPal, GStore and more. It also has a number of games like Danger Dash, Kingdoms, Bubble Bash 3, etc. But if you don’t find these apps useful, you’ll face no trouble uninstalling them.. There weren’t any complaints from our side when it came to the smartphone’s performance. It handled almost all routine tasks like launching and switching apps or multitasking on Chrome without any stutters or lags.Launching and switching between apps was not a problem either. Using multiple tabs of Chrome was also not an issue. In general day to day tasks, we faced no lag.. Multi-tasking was also handled by Gionee M7 Power seamlessly. Other multitasking operations like listening to music while navigating or playing games was handled seamlessly. The smartphone offers consistent and smooth performance while performing any kind of task you assign. Browsing the Web or social media apps comes naturally to it and you’ll have no complaints.. The biggest USP of the device is the battery it comes. The 5000mAH battery generally lasted for two days on a single charge. You can perform all kinds of tasks on the smartphone – games, music, social media – and the battery still lasts close to two days. It’s certainly one of the most impressive features of the Gionee M7 Power. Be it playing music while using navigation or playing games – the smartphone took it quite well. You can browse the Internet or use social media apps like Facebook and Instagram, but the performance of the smartphone will remain smooth and consistent. The cell phone reception was good most of the times, even in areas like basements and elevators.. If the battery life impressed us then the optics did disappoint. The 13MP primary camera is just about reasonable. In well-lit conditions, the images were satisfactory but step in dimly lit condition and it falters. The colour reproduction isn’t particularly great either – be it in any sort of lighting conditions. The clarity and sharpness of the images suffer to a great extent in the Gionee M7 Power. While bokeh effect might be the buzzword for most cameras these days, Gionee M7 Power comes with 3D effect.. The front camera does a better job than the rear one but there are a host of other smartphones that perform way better than Gionee M7 Power. The cameras are certainly not the reason to buy this device. The battery of the smartphone is probably the biggest reason for you to buy it. The 5000mAh battery usually lasted for 2 days on a single charge. Use the smartphone for watching videos, playing games listening to music, and keeping your self updated with various social media apps like Facebook and Instagram. It will still last two days on a single charge. We were thoroughly impressed by Gionee M7 Power’s battery life.. However, optics were a little disappointing. The 13MP primary camera does a decent job. Images taken in well lit conditions were satisfactory, but in dimly lit conditions, it falters a bit. But we did notice a difference in colour reproduction. They weren’t accurate most of the times – be it well lit or dimly lit conditions. Th clarity and sharpness of images was also not up to the mark. Unlike most other camera centric smartphones that come with Bokeh effect, Gionee M7 Power has a 3D effect.. The front facing camera does a better job, but there are other camera centric smartphones like Honor 9i that perform better as far as this aspect goes. We ran some benchmark tests on Gionee M7 Power and it scored 45825 in Antutu and 680 and 2614 in Single core and Multi core scores of Geekbench 4.. It’s a bit tricky to categorise the Gionee M7 Power. As far as sturdy smartphones go, this is a solid smartphone. Add to it the excellent battery life with reliable overall performance and Gionee M7 Power isn’t a bad bet. The disappointing cameras and rather mundane looking design are features which can easily alter your decision to buy it as there are better options – Honor 9i for instance – available in the market. And that perhaps is the biggest obstacle Gionee will end up facing. In the just above Rs 15,000 price bracket, there are smartphones that offer better specs and are better all-round performers. If battery is a clincher for you, go for the Gionee M7 Power. However, if you’re looking for a complete package then this might not be the smartphone for you. If you are looking for a sturdy smartphone which comes with a good built and an amazing battery life, you can go for Gionee M7 Power. However, you can find other smartphones in the mid-range segment that are better performers. The recently launched Honor 9i has comes with a better display and camera experience.. Honor 9i Octa core performance Octa core 6.0" (15.24 cm) display 5.9" (14.99 cm) 64 GB storage 64 GB 13 MP camera 16 MP 5000 mAh battery 3340 mAh 4 GB ram 4 GB. performance Octa core display 6.0" (15.24 cm) storage 64 GB camera 13 MP battery 5000 mAh ram 4 GB See Full Specifications.

Gionee M7 Power has a big 5,000mAh battery, 18:9 FullView display and more. But does it have what it takes to stand out? We decided to find out in our preview. Gionee finally unveiled a new mid-range smartphone dubbed Gionee M7 Power in India. The key attraction of Gionee M7 Power has to be a big 5,000mAh battery, which I’m expecting to last two days. As far as specifications of Gionee M7 Power are concerned, it sports a 6-inch (18:9 aspect ratio) display with 1,440 x 720 pixels resolution and 268 ppi pixel density. During our initial observations, I figured out that it lacks a Gorilla Glass protection and oleophobic c oating. It has a 2.5D curved glass layered on top. Design-wise, it flaunts a laser-grilled finish on the rear which is unique. It offers a bit ticklish when I held the handset during my initial observations. As for dimensions, the handset measures 8.6mm in thickness and weighs 187g, which is acceptable for a phone. carrying such big capacity battery under the hood. Interestingly, the fingerprint scanner is now on the rear, which is different from what we’ve seen previously with Gionee A1 selfie phones lineup. But it makes sense that there’s not enough room up front due to minimum bezels anyway. It also offers an IR blaster up top so that users can control their TVs or ACs. Giving you a quick rundown of camera specs, Gionee M7 Power features a 13-megapixel main shooter with autofocus and LED flash. What I found interesting here is the fact that it can also record 4K videos. Up front, there’s a 8-megapixel selfie camera for those who like to take more selfies. Gionee M7 Power is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 SoC and Adreno 505 GPU for graphics. Internally, it packs 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. The handset comes in multiple colour options such as Gold, Black and Dark Blue. I got a Dark Blue variant for preview, though. Do keep in mind that these are only initial observations. So, stay tuned for a full review.. During my initial observations about Gionee M7 Power, I figured out that multitasking was fine and there was no noticeable lag whatsoever. It lacks an oleophobic coating to safeguard the display against smudges and fingerprints. However, the sunlight legibility looks promising. Casual games should run just fine. I’m looking forward to using the device for a longer period of time to come up with a concrete conclusion with regards to its working, overall performance and of course, its battery backup.

However, it comes without a Gorilla glass protection up front. an oleophobic coating, which is kind of a deal breaker for me.. The screen ends up being receptive to smudges and fingerprints way too much. What I liked about the display is its sunlight legibility. The screen appears bright enough and may not put users in discomfort while using it under direct sunlight. There are no fancy features with regards to display but users can configure adaptive brightness and backlight..

Priced at Rs 16,999 and offering exceptional battery life and future-ready 18:9 aspect ratio screen, Gionee M7 Power competes with Nokia 6, Honor 9i, and LG Q6 Plus. Last Updated at November 25, 2017 01:14 IST. Enter the characters shown in the image. Gionee M7 Power Overall, the primary and selfie cameras are regular shooters delivering optimally in good daylight conditions but failing in low-light situations. Battery With a 5,000 mAh battery, the smartphone is a powerhouse that runs for more than a day. The phone, however, is full of pre-installed bloatware eating into precious internal storage and affecting the overall battery endurance. Performance The M7 Power is, foremost, a battery-centric device. Powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor, an octa-core SoC, the phone has 64 GB of internal memory and a 4GB RAM. The processor is no powerhouse and the result is visible while using the device. The phone performs basic tasks like calling, SMS, instant messages, social media and internet browsing with ease, but stutters while playing games or watching high-definition videos on YouTube for extended hours. Gionee M7 Power The phone boots the Android Nougat 7.1 operating system covered under the Amigo 5.0 theme. The theme offers several advantages over the stock Android, such as app clone feature, creating space for dual social media apps in phone. Other features include split screen, intelligent eye protection, smart gesture, black screen gesture, glove patterns. Verdict At a price of Rs 16,999, the Gionee M7 Power offers exceptional battery life, and a future-ready 18:9 aspect ratio screen. In its price segment, the phone competes with Nokia 6, Honor 9i, and LG Q6 Plus.. Gionee M7 Power with 18:9 screen, 5000 mAh battery launched: Details here. Gionee A1 Plus: Smartphone offers little to justify Rs 26,999 price tag. Gionee inks pact with Reliance Jio to offer up to 60 GB extra data. Punjab likely to allow open access of power for railways. With ultra-wide screen being one of the key features dominating the smartphone industry this year, Chinese handset maker Gionee has also jumped on the bandwagon. Its latest offering, the M7 Power smartphone, has ditched the 16:9 aspect ratio screen in favour of an 18:9 ‘FullView display’. The aluminium-clad Gionee M7 Power, true to its name, is primarily a powerful smartphone with a mammoth 5,000 mAh battery. The 3D photo is another key feature differentiating it with competitors. Business Standard reviewed the Gionee M7 Power to test its display, battery and camera capabilities, besides the overall smartphone performance. Here are our observations: Display The M7 Power boasts a 6-inch IPS HD screen in the 18:9 aspect ratio, covered with a 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass. The display looks bright and covers almost the entire front, though the top and bottom bezels are still prominent. Gionee M7 Power For a 6-inch screen, the HD resolution panel looks pixelated at times, especially while watching multimedia content. The text also doesn’t look sharp and might make avid readers a little wary. But the addition of a software-based reading mode does help reduce the blue light glare that strains eyes while reading. Overall, the screen offers good contrast and sunlight legibility. The ultra-wide screen means an 85 per cent screen-to-body ratio assuring high display area and limited bezels. Camera The M7 Power sports a 13-megapixel rear camera and an 8MP front-facing selfie-camera. The primary camera comes equipped with several modes – text recognition, translation, slow-motion, time-lapse, professional, panorama, back light, card scanner and 3D photo. Gionee M7 Power The addition of a 3D Photo feature in the otherwise regular 13MP primary camera makes a difference.. The 3D Photo feature allows users to capture a 3D picture that can be later viewed from different angles. The feature works as intended in most cases, but shows artificial stitching effects sometimes, ruining the 3D outlook.. First Published: Sat, November 25 2017.

Smooth performance is the most basic requirement a phone should offer, but what qualifies as acceptable performance on a budget varies from user to user.. The Gionee M7 Power is the company's latest addition in the sub-20K segment. From our first impressions of the device, we have already established that it is a good looking phone, offering a large battery, but does not have the performance to match the price it comes at. Can it take on the current heavyweight champions in the sub 20k segment? Let's find out.. Amongst the wide range of, yet similar looking budget smartphones, the Gionee M7 Power seems like a fresh take on how the phone in this segment should look. The centerpiece of the design is the large 18:9 aspect ratio display. The plastic sides of the phone are chamfered and hide the rigid metal chassis. However, instead of using the sides themselves as antennas, Gionee has done things the old-fashioned way. Hence, there are plastic strips along the top and bottom of the phone which hide the various connectivity antennas. The back itself is metal and textured. It feels nice to touch but does not add to the ergonomics of the device as it is just as slippery as a smooth metal back. That said, the thicker design along with the partially rounded sides does make it easier to hold.. As for the display, it is adequately bright and vibrant. It has good touch response and even with a lower 720p resolution manages to look just as good as any other phone display in the same price. That said, I do feel that the display would have looked better with thinner bezels around the side. The sunlight legibility of the device is decent and I didn't have any issue viewing the phones outdoors.. If you are coming from an older Gionee phone, the UI on the device with the Amigo OS layered on top of Android Nougat will look familiar. However, things have changed considerably from the Gionee A1 Plus days. The quick toggle is now available in a drop-down format instead of the regular command center format. The notification panel still classifies incoming notifications by default into important and unimportant and hides both of them by default. The settings menu is still customised (different from stock Android) and swiping to the right settings menu takes you to the features shortcuts.. In addition, apart from the regular set of bloatware apps, some apps from Gionee’s Amigo launcher require some critical access, which raises some privacy concerns. For example, why would the Clock or the Calendar app require access to call capabilities? The Calendar app also requires access to record audio or read SMS, and somehow has no functionality to add events to the calendar via SMS or to create an event via audio. All of which seems quite alarming to me.. Apart from the intrusive UI, the other thing which I feel is unsatisfactory is the phone's performance. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 which is a tried and tested SoC, on the M7 Power, however, seems rather underpowered. While the phone feels stutter-free for the most part, it feels slow compared to many other devices in the same price bracket. There is a definite lag while switching between apps and heavier games take their sweet time to load. In addition, heavier games such as Injustice 2 just won’t run sometimes unless you clear all running apps from the multitasking menu. That said, in-game performance is usable and only users with a keen eye will catch the occasional fps drop.. While the Performance of the device is rather weak compared to most phones available at the price, the M7 Power tries to balance things out with its battery life. Featuring a 5000mAh battery, the M7 Power can easily last you more than a day, even if you are a heavy user. You can easily stream more than 10 hours of content on the phone on a single charge and still make it through the rest of the day. The phone can also be used to reverse charge other devices such as your other phone, tablet or an MP3 Player and more.. At the back of the phone, you get a 13MP camera, which takes decent images but lacks details and colour accuracy you might get from the Xiaomi Mi A1 or the Moto G5 Plus. The camera on the M7 Power works best in ample lighting conditions, but the image quality quickly deteriorates as one move to low light settings. While the colour accuracy is good, the main issue here is the noise which is apparent even in some normal lighting conditions and is distinctly visible in low light images. The camera also has a 2X digital zoom, which is not as good as an optical zoom that some other phones offer. The 1080p video capture is average at best and lacks any sort of stabilization and seems to have a sluggish focus.. Similarly, the front-facing 8MP camera on the phone is also average at best. You get the regular set of beautify modes, which whitens skin, removes blemishes, etc, but then lose on details. You also get a software blur effect in one of the modes, but there is a wide inconsistency in images taken.. Like the UI, the camera app is also littered with features, like filters, modes and more. One main feature available on the rear camera is a 3D image capture feature. This allows the user to take an image of an object or person, by taking a panorama image of the subject. The camera algorithm then stitches it together and makes it interactive. It is a neat trick, but apps like this are available in the Google play store by many third-party developers.. Overall, the Gionee M7 Power is a phone for the niche. For someone who requires a phone with a taller (18:9 aspect ratio) display and a bigger battery, but can work with average performance. To me, the phone does look good and even though the screen resolution is just 720p, it seems to fit in. However, the performance of the device is rather unsatisfactory compared to other offerings at the same price. Hence, it loses out to devices such as the Xiaomi Mi A1, Moto G5 Plus or the Honor 9i ..

Today in New Delhi , India. Metro cities - Delhi Mumbai Chennai Kolkata. Other cities - Noida Gurgaon Bengaluru Hyderabad Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Lucknow Patna Ranchi. Gionee M7 Power first impressions: Full-screen phone with big 5,000mAh battery. Sporting a 6-inch Infinity Display, Gionee M7 Power will be available for pre-orders on Amazon from November 17 and goes on sale on November 25. Updated: Nov 16, 2017 14:24 IST. Read our detailed first impressions of the Gionee M7 Power.(HT Photo). This year will be remembered for how edge-to-edge smartphone displays went mainstream from being mere concepts. From Xiaomi to Samsung and even Apple, all major brands have at least one full-screen phone in their portfolio. And those that don’t are sooner or later going to join the trend.. Gionee is the latest to hop onto the bandwagon. The company launched on Wednesday the M7 Power in India. With a mammoth 5,000mAh battery, the smartphone is priced at Rs 16,999, and is set to compete against the likes of Moto G5 Plus, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and the Moto X4. Ahead of the launch, we spent considerable time with the Gionee M7 Power. Gionee deserves praise for finally attempting to try out something new on the design front. After all, it was the brand that once launched the Elife S5.5, touted as the slimmest smartphones in the world. But of late, Gionee’s smartphones look monotonous. Fortunately, M7 Power isn’t like any Gionee smartphones you have seen in recent times.. It’s tall, slim and comes with a beautiful back panel. The rear, which looks similar to the Pixel 2 XL, comes with a textured finish. While contemporary phones have a ‘curvy’ element, the M7 Power has a flat-ish slab-like form factor. It’s easy to grip and comfortable in the palms.. The biggest draw of the smartphone is its 6-inch ‘FullView’ display. But the resolution at 1440 x 720 resolution is a bit inferior when compared to other full-screen phones such as the Galaxy S8 and Xiaomi Mi MIX 2. It’s also not entirely edge-to-edge — there’s a fair bit of bezel on the circumference of the display.. But the screen fluidly gels with the body, especially when it is off. At least, it looks decent enough in black.. While we can overlook the display, considering the price point and the 5,000mAh battery proposition, Gionee’s Amigo 5.0 custom skin on top of Android Nougat (v7.1.1) feels a bit dated. Of course, Amigo brings a variety of customisation and exclusive features, but I think it’s time Gionee embraces the stock Android, just like Nokia and Lenovo. Based on my experience in past few days, Amigo hasn’t changed a lot but seems a bit refined. But again, there’s a fair bit of monotony.. The Gionee M7 Power comes with a 13-megapixel auto-focus camera on the back and an 8-megapixel front camera. The camera performance is pretty much on par with phones in the mid-range category if not better. We are yet to fully test the cameras in all possible light conditions. As far as first impressions go, it seemed fast enough and pretty decent. The highlight though is a built-in 3D feature.. Gionee M7 Power is one of the most good looking phones.. Essentially, you need to shoot a subject in 120-degree angle, and the device automatically renders a 3D effect. It’s an interesting feature and fun to use. But just like Bothie feature, I ain’t sure I am going to frequently use this feature. It’s a bit of gimmick, in our opinion, but fun nonetheless. By the way, there are plenty of third-party apps on Google Play Store that let you capture 3D images. Gionee’s M7 Power seems like a pretty decent phone with its own hits and misses. Full screen, 5,000mAh battery are certainly attractive propositions, but Snapdragon 435 SoC is a bummer. Phones like the Xiaomi Redmi 4 and LG Q6 run on that SoC and come at a much lower price. Stay tuned for our detailed review of the phone..

Gionee M7 Power price in Nigeria. Gionee M7 Power is the watered-down variant of the M7 , Gionee’s flagship smartphone of 2017. The M7 Power comes with a 6-inch display , 4gigs of RAM , 64GB internal storage , 13MP camera and 5000mAh battery.. 1 The Gionee M7 Power Specs (Key) : 1.1 Design & Display 1.2 Memory & Performance 1.3 Camera 1.4 Battery, Connectivity & Software 2 Pricing & Availability 3 Gionee M7 Power Full Specifications 3.1 Related. Like the M7, the Gionee M7 Power comes with a 6-inch FullView display with 2.5D curved glass and has a 720 x 1440 pixels resolution. It weighs 187 grams and is 8.6 millimetres thick, all thanks to its large battery capacity. An 85% screen-to-body ratio ensures that you get a reasonable measure of screen real estate, and a maximum brightness level of 500 Nits helps in screen legibility in outdoor situations.. This smartphone has a similar design with the Gionee M7 which includes minimal top and bottom bezels and very thin side bezels, on-screen navigation buttons and a fingerprint sensor on its anodized rear panel which provides beautiful pattern when light is reflected on it.. It has a metal unibody design and has antenna lines running through the top and bottom of its rear panel. Its power button and volume rockers are located on the left side of the smartphone.. The smartphone’s back shell is made with high-grade 6-series aluminium which is laser-engraved and has laser-drilled finishes. Apart from unlocking the smartphones, the fingerprint sensor can be used to perform other functions like taking photos in the camera app and turning on/off the flashlight.. Unlike the M7 which uses a MediaTek processor, the Gionee M7 Power has a Snapdragon 435 Mobile Platform processor with eight processor cores and a clock speed of 1.4GHz handling its operations, and an Adreno 505 GPU taking care of its graphics.. The smartphone comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory which can be further expanded up to 256GB using an external microSD card.. The M7 Power sports a single 13MP camera which has a f/2.0 aperture to allow a moderate amount of light into the lens and Phase Detection Auto Focus which stabilises images even when they are in motion at the rear, along with a LED flash which provides lighting for both regular operations and photo shoots.. An 8MP camera is also present at the front of the smartphone for selfies and videos.. The Gionee M7 Power packs a whopping 5000mAh battery capacity which can’t be removed except if the phone is taken apart. The problem with large batteries like this one is, even though they last long on a single charge (sometimes even more than two days), they take time (sometimes more than four hours) to get a full charge when they go low. The M7 Power eliminates this problem with fast charging.. It has a hybrid dual Nano SIM slot and supports 4G VoLTE networks. The smartphone runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat upon which version 5.0 of Gionee’s Amigo OS is layered.. The M7 Power price in Nigeria could not be obtained because this device is not yet available in the country. Dark blue, black and gold colors..
