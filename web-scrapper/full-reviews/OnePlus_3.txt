The Chinese startup has improved on a number of issues fans had with its predecessor, wrapping the OnePlus 3 in a new premium suit and managed to keep the price low enough to worry the established names in the market.. Read our full OnePlus 5 review OnePlus 3 price and release date Released in June 2016 Production stopped November 2016 Design First full-metal design by OnePlus makes it far more attractive than previous phones New Soft Gold version offers a brighter alternative to the standard grey The OnePlus 3 has a mute switch, which many Android phones don't offer. Update : Android Oreo has started rolling out to OnePlus 3 handsets. But if you want an even bigger upgrade you're in luck, because the OnePlus 5T has just launched.. Third time's a charm, right? Well that's what OnePlus will be hoping with its third-generation flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 3.. True to its 'Never Settle' mantra, OnePlus is pushing forward with its 'flagship specs for half the price' game plan, and with the new OnePlus 3 the signs are positive.. After the initial breakout success of the OnePlus One in 2014, the follow up from the Chinese outfit was a little lackluster, with the OnePlus 2 failing to reach the same heights as its predecessor.. If anything, OnePlus was a victim of its own success, as expectations for its second installment went above and beyond what the still-small firm was capable of.. OnePlus founder Carl Pei told me during a briefing for the OnePlus 3 that "people have very, very high expectations. We got very lucky with the first device, and people wanted more. We have to balance expectations with what we're capable of".. Weight : 158g Dimensions : 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4mm OS : Android 6.0.1 Screen size : 5.5-inch Resolution : 1080 x 1920 CPU : Snapdragon 820 RAM : 6GB Storage : 64GB Battery : 3000mAh Rear camera : 16MP Front camera : 8MP. As you may expect then, from a flagship handset costing just US$399 (£329, around AU$450), OnePlus has indeed had to balance features against expectation, but with the OnePlus 3 the compromises are more acceptable.. There's no QHD resolution (you'll have to make do with full HD), nor is there a microSD slot, and users have just one internal storage option: 64GB. But if you can look past those minor shortcomings, and embrace the power, premium design and performance the OnePlus 3 is offering, this is the firm's best ever device.. With a Snapdragon 820 processor, 6GB of RAM, 16MP rear camera, 8MP front snapper, fingerprint scanner and 3,000mAh fast-charging battery, the OnePlus 3 has the tools – on paper at least – to take on the big names.. The OnePlus 2 claimed to be the 2016 Flagship Killer, and while it fell way short of living up to that boast, the OnePlus 3 may just be able to claim the title.. The OnePlus 3 launched at $399 in the US and hasn't changed in price, but it's not the same for those in the UK. Since July 11 the OnePlus 3 has cost £329, instead of the £309 launch price, due to the Pound weakening after the Brexit campaign.. However, just six months after its launch OnePlus ceased production of the 3 as it announced its beefed up brother - the OnePlus 3T .. Since then the OnePlus 3T has also been discontinued and even the OnePlus 5 has been and gone, replaced by the $499/£449 OnePlus 5T.. The single biggest advancement from the OnePlus 2 to the OnePlus 3 is the design. I forgave the original OnePlus One's polycarbonate looks because the phone offered such fantastic value for money, but when the OnePlus 2 came round many people, myself included, wanted more than what was on offer.. Thankfully OnePlus has answered fan's calls for a more premium design, delivering its first metal uni-body smartphone in the OnePlus 3, cut from a single slab of aluminum.. The metal chassis signals the evolution of OnePlus brand from a slightly shaky Chinese startup to a brand that knows what it's doing, and knows what people want. It doesn't break any new ground in terms of looks, with flashes of iPhone, HTC and Samsung, but it's great to eyeball and hold in the hand.. You've got the choice of two colors. Graphite (basically Space Grey) was available at launch, but Soft Gold has only recently come into stock - and soft is certainly the right word.. In some light the gold finish looks almost silver, but it's pleasing understated and is a lot more tasteful than the slightly garish Rose Gold attempts of late.. Round the front you get a while panel instead of black on the graphite, giving the Soft Gold OnePlus 3 a brighter, lighter appearance.. It's a shame that OnePlus hasn't taken smartphone design in a new direction, but a quick look at the top phones across all the major manufacturers shows that there's a fair amount of – how shall I put this – 'borrowing' when it comes to styling.. Front-on the OnePlus 3 isn't anything special – it's a relatively standard black (or white, if you opt for soft gold) slab coated in Gorilla Glass 4, with the main feature being the indented fingerprint scanner-come-home-button oval below the display.. The fingerprint scanner is much quicker at recognizing your digits and unlocking the OnePlus 3 than it was on the OnePlus 2, with a quoted time of just 0.3 seconds. While I can't vouch for the exact speed I can see that it's impressively quick, and I didn't have any issues when using it. OnePlus says it's faster than Apple's Touch ID, and I'm inclined to agree.. Either side of the scanner you'll find touch-sensitive navigation keys which are only visible when tapped, with a single white LED illuminating for a couple of seconds before disappearing into the bezel.. These are responsive and easy to hit, and you can program them in the settings menu, enabling you to perform extra functions with a hold action rather than a tap. You can also swap them round – so if you prefer your back key to be on the right rather than the left you can do just that.. As well as the toughened Gorilla Glass on the front of the phone, OnePlus has also included a factory-fitted screen protector to prevent scratches, but it's a little annoying. It doesn't cover the whole screen, and at times I could see the edge of the protector running down each side of the display, which distracts from the on-screen action.. Fortunately you can remove it pretty easily, and it doesn't leave any nasty residue on the glass – but you're unlikely to get the bubble-free finish if you try to re-apply it, so make sure you really want it gone before peeling it off.. Along the left side of the 7.35mm-thick OnePlus 3 are the volume rocker and notification slider. The latter has three positions: all notifications, priority notifications and silent, enabling you to quickly adjust the setting without waking the screen.. It's a hat-tip to Apple's mute switch on the iPhone, and it's something I found very useful during my time with the OnePlus 3 – especially when it came to quickly muting the phone during meetings and cinema trips.. On the other side is the power/lock key, which sits below the dual-SIM tray. Yes that's right – the OnePlus 3 can handle two SIMs. On some other devices, such as the Huawei P9 , the second SIM slot also doubles as a microSD slot, but that's not the case here – as mentioned, there's no expandable storage option.. The explanation given to me by OnePlus's Pei for why the company continues to shun expandable storage comes down to user experience.. "MicroSD is a big ask [from our fans]," Pei explained, "but it's not a good ask. It's not a good user experience". You may not agree, but that's the thinking over at OnePlus.. The buttons are well positioned, and as long as your hands are big enough to grapple the OnePlus 3 you'll be able to hit them without issue when using the phone one-handed.. There's nothing on the top edge, while the base is packed with a speaker grille, USB-C port and headphone jack – OnePlus certainly isn't ready to ditch the 3.5mm jack just yet, unlike Motorola with the Moto Z .. Moving round the back, the gently curving rear and the antenna bands at the top and bottom of the handset are reminiscent of the HTC One M9 , while the square camera bulge has something of the Samsung Galaxy S6 about it.. It's a pleasing premium look, if a little understated, and its arched backed means the OnePlus 3 sits nicely in the palm, enabling you to get a decent grip around what is a large handset.. The OnePlus 3 is a phone I really do enjoy holding, flipping it over repeatedly in my hand and gazing at it as it resides on my desk. There's nothing complex going on here, but it's that simplicity that I find alluring. In that sense it's similar to Apple's iPhone design, although the curved rear beats the flat backs of the Cupertino firm's handsets.. Design-wise, OnePlus has done something special then. The OnePlus 3 doesn't look out of place alongside the iPhone 6S , Samsung Galaxy S7 , HTC 10 and LG G5 , yet it's almost half the price. For that, at least, it must be applauded..

The Good The OnePlus 3's sharp camera, powerful processor and enduring, quick-charging battery make a knockout combo when you factor in its low price.. The Bad The camera has a distinct bulge. Power users may be disappointed that the phone doesn't have a swappable battery or expandable storage.. The Bottom Line At $400, the OnePlus 3 is the best budget Android phone you can buy, with a premium look and feel, and performance fast enough to go head-to-head with any high-end handset on the market.. Fall 2016 update Design: High-class metal looks. Software and other features: Keeping it clean and simple. Camera: Capture great photos without really trying. In June, the OnePlus 3 redefined the boundaries of what a midrange phone could deliver. For $399 or £309 (about AU$590), you get a top-of-the-line processor, a nimble 16-megapixel camera, and a long-lasting battery. You also get a speedy performance that rivals much more expensive Android champs such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the LG G5. Its greatest limitation is that it supports only carriers using GSM technology; that's everyone in the UK and Australia, but only AT&T and T-Mobile in the US, which excludes Verizon and Sprint customers.. The landscape shifted again in August, however, with the introduction of the Asus ZenFone 3 and Huawei Honor 8. The ZenFone 3 draws on aesthetic elements of the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S but delivers midrange specs at a very competitive price point. Starting at $249 for the 32GB model (£170 or AU$350), it's a simply a fantastic deal -- currently limited to folks in Asia, however. The phone is scheduled to launch in the US, where it will likely be sold unlocked, and the UK in Q4 2016.. We've only had a preview of the Honor 8 so far, but we like the look of its glossy, reflective coating. It's similar to last year's Huawei P9 , which featured two rear cameras, a slim design, plenty of power, and a vibrant screen, but the 32GB Honor 8 comes in at a much more affordable $400 compared to the P9's 2015 introductory price of $650.. In short, the 2016 midrange phone market is bursting with excellent options that include the OnePlus3, ZenFone 3, and Motorola Moto G4 (and G4 Plus ). What a time to be alive for phone-loving penny-pinchers.. Editors' note: The original OnePlus 3 review, published in June 2016, follows.. Last year, my idea of a fantastic "high-end" budget phone was something like the Google Nexus 5X -- a bit smaller than your usual flagship with a decent-but-not-mindblowing camera and a processor that, while not at the top of the class, still made gameplay and movie streaming fun. But for less than $400, that was about the best you could get.. For $399 or £309 (which converts to about AU$590), you get a top-of-the-line processor, a nimble 16-megapixel camera and a long-lasting battery. You also get a speedy performance that rivals reigning (and more expensive) Android champs such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the LG G5 .. Like all OnePlus phones, the handset only works with carriers using GSM technology. That's everyone in the UK and Australia, but in the US that means AT&T and T-Mobile (it won't be compatible with Verizon and Sprint users, unfortunately). But unlike previous launches, you won't have to wait for an invitation to get your hands on it. OnePlus is releasing it to the masses right at launch and you can order it from the OnePlus website. This is great news for anyone in the market for a new handset, because the OnePlus 3 hits enough high marks to be your next phone.. With a new aluminum unibody design, the OnePlus 3 looks better than all of OnePlus' past devices (which either had a plastic or glass backing). It still looks similar to the HTC 10 and other smartphones, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing -- after all, the 10 is a pretty handsome phone. If you're not into the metal look of this slim and attractive device, OnePlus offers snap-on covers made of wood, bamboo and other materials.. On the right edge is OnePlus' familiar toggle. You can not only slide this to turn notifications on and off, but also to turn on priority notifications. Below the display, the home button doubles as a fingerprint sensor, and on the bottom edge are the speaker, headphone jack and USB Type-C port for charging.. With an aluminum-clad body, the OnePlus 3 features polished looks.. On the back is the rear camera, which bulges outward from the surface of the handset. Many well-known phones do this too, including the iPhone 6S. It doesn't damage the camera or hinder your use of it, but OnePlus 3's camera bulge is quite thick and a bit unseemly.. Despite all that, there's much to like about the phone. The 5.5-inch, 1080p resolution display is bright and sharp, and I like the way its edges smoothly curve down into the bezel. There are also chamfered details around the display and charging port, which catch and reflect light in interesting ways.. All in all, the OnePlus 3 has a truly elevated aesthetic compared to its predecessors, and it's good-looking enough to beat most budget phones. Not only does it have premium specs on the inside, but with its aluminum construction and subtle detailing, it now flaunts a premium exterior to match.. The device features OnePlus' own OxygenOS interface that runs on top of Google Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow (though it will be able to updated to Android N at a later date). Aside from a few choice Google services, the handset barely has any pre-installed (read: potentially annoying and unneeded) apps. And you can download and install anything you're missing from the Google Play Store.. You'll also get OnePlus' signature Shelf feature. Shelf is an extra homepage that gives you access to your recent apps, favorite contacts and any other widgets you want to add. I found it can be useful when I wanted to quickly check email or jot down a to-do item, but if you're not a fan you can disable it.. OnePlus' signature Shelf home page (left), and the various ways you can customize the homescreen (right).. With OxygenOS, there's plenty of room for you to customize the interface. You can choose different accent colors for the menu items and change the color of the LED notifications light. You can also load your own icon packs and turn on on-screen control buttons. There are also plenty of gesture controls, such as double tapping to wake up the screen (a feature included on many LG phones), or drawing an O shape to launch the camera.. One of my favorite goodies is Night mode, which will tint the display to reduce eye strain when you look at the screen in the dark. This feature just arrived natively to Android N and was introduced in iOS 9 as Night Shift. And lastly, the OnePlus 3 will see the return of the Near Field Communication chip (it was missing from the last two OnePlus flagships). These days, NFC is considered a standard among smartphones, and it allows them to communicate wirelessly with other NFC-enabled objects -- it's critical for mobile payment services such as Android Pay .. Photo quality on the device's 16-megapixel camera was solid, and I was impressed by how bright and clear images turned out. In well-lit situations, colors were true-to-life (especially the white hues), and objects were sharp and in focus. In dimmer settings or environments with tricky lighting, photos still turned out clear and evenly exposed. Check out the picture quality of the sample photos over the page.

OnePlus ( Chinese : 一加科技 ; pinyin : Yījiā Kējì ) is a Shenzhen based Chinese smartphone manufacturer founded by Pete Lau (CEO) and Carl Pei in December 2013. The company officially serves 38 countries and regions around the world as of March 2016. They have released 7 phones, amongst other products.. 1.1 Discontinuation of the invite system. 1.2 "Smash the Past" campaign. 1.5 Ban in India. 1.6 Cease of operations in Indonesia. 1.7 OnePlus 2 launch invite issue. 1.8 OnePlus customer support. 1.9 OnePlus 2 software updates. 1.10 OnePlus USB-C cable. OnePlus was founded on 16 December 2013 by former Oppo vice-president Pete Lau (刘作虎) and Carl Pei (裴宇). [2] According to the Chinese government's documentation, the only institutional stockholder in OnePlus is Oppo. [3] Although Lau initially denied that OnePlus was a wholly owned subsidiary of Oppo, upon release of the regulatory filings they admitted that they are owned by Oppo and are "in talks with other investors" (although nothing has been announced to date). [4] The company's main goal was to design a smartphone that would balance high-end quality with a lower price than other phones in its class, believing that users would "Never Settle" ( Chinese : 不将就 ) for the lower-quality devices produced by other companies. Lau explained that "we will never be different just for the sake of being different. Everything done has to improve the actual user experience in day-to-day use." [5] [6] He also showed aspirations of being the " Muji of the tech industry", emphasizing its focus on high-quality products with simplistic, user-friendly designs. [5] Continuing Lau's association with the platform from the Oppo N1 , [6] OnePlus entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc. to base its products' Android distribution upon a variant of the popular custom ROM CyanogenMod and use its trademarks outside of China. The company unveiled its first device, the OnePlus One , on 23 April 2014. [5] In December 2014, alongside the release of the OnePlus One in India exclusively through Amazon, OnePlus also announced plans to establish a presence in the country, with plans to open 25 official walk-in service centres across India. OnePlus made its products available in Southeast Asia for the first time, partnering with Lazada Indonesia [10] on 23 January 2015 and is expected to expand during this year throughout the region.. In April 2014, OnePlus hired Han Han as the product ambassador in mainland China. On 9 March 2014 the company decided to expand its operations to all European countries except Switzerland (although OnePlus devices can be purchased in Switzerland via local online retailers), serving now 43 countries and regions all over the world. As of March 2016, OnePlus serves for the following countries and regions: [ citation needed ] Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , Canada , Mainland China , Croatia , Cyprus , Czech Republic , Denmark , Egypt , Estonia , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Hong Kong , Hungary , India , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Malta , Malaysia , Netherlands , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Saudi Arabia , Singapore , Spain , Slovakia , Slovenia , Sweden , the United Arab Emirates , the United Kingdom and the United States .. OnePlus ended the invite system with the launch of OnePlus 3 on 14 June 2016. [12] Announced via an interactive VR launch event, the OnePlus 3 initially went on sale within the VR app itself. OnePlus touted the event as the world's first VR shopping experience. [13] The phone was made available for sale later that day in China, North America and Europe on the OnePlus website, and in India on Amazon India. On 25 April 2014, OnePlus began its "Smash the Past" campaign. [14] The promotion asked selected participants to destroy their phones on video in an effort to purchase the OnePlus One for $1 (US). Due to confusion, several videos were published by unselected users misinterpreting the promotion and destroying their phones before the promotion start date. The campaign was heavily criticized for environmental waste and safety concerns, due to batteries and phone components posing potential hazards to participants destroying their phones. [17] [18] OnePlus allowed the winners to donate the old phone. [19] There were 140,000 entrants in the contest with 100 winners. On 13 August 2014, OnePlus hosted a contest to give invites, which were hard to come by at the time, to their women forum members. Users were asked to post a photo of themselves with the OnePlus logo, images would be shared in the forum and could be ´liked´ by other forum members. [23] Hours after being announced, the campaign was stopped because of the sexist implications in the election process. OnePlus stated that a few 'rogue' employees created the campaign. On 16 December 2014, The Delhi High Court banned the import and sales of OnePlus One phones in India following a lawsuit by Micromax alleging it has exclusivity for shipping phones with Cyanogen OS software in India. As of 21 December 2014, the banning of import and selling of the device in India has been lifted. The device continues to be shipped with Cyanogen OS; however, a customized version of Android specially designed by OnePlus and named OxygenOS has been released, allowing later OnePlus devices to be sold in India. In June 2016, OnePlus made the decision to pull out of the Indonesian market due to local regulations for imported 4G smartphones restricting sales of the OnePlus 2. [27] After-sales support such as warranty claims and repairs for the OnePlus One and X were taken over by PT Multi Mobile Indonesia. In advance of the OnePlus 2 launch, OnePlus assured customers that obtaining invites would be easier, and handsets would ship a lot quicker than with the OnePlus One. However, in a public apology, Carl Pei admitted the company had "messed up" the launch, and that OnePlus "only began shipping meaningful quantities [the week of 10 September 2015], nearly a month after [the] initial targeted shipping date." [28] [29]. This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations.

In 2014 and 2015, OnePlus customer support was criticized on various tech communities on the internet, including Reddit, XDA Developers and OnePlus' own forum. [ citation needed ] Many customers claim to have had to wait days or even weeks for replies from the support staff once they opened a ticket. Other customers were denied their warranty covered repairs due to water or other usage related damage, when in fact they could prove that there was no such damage before they shipped off their phone for repair. OnePlus improved customer support in 2017, by not only increasing the number of customer service staff but by adding local language support. Despite promising 24 months of software updates and telling consumers that the OnePlus 2 would be updated to Android 7 "Nougat", it was eventually confirmed that this was not to happen, leaving the device on the older Android 6.0.1 version. After several weeks of customer complaints on OnePlus forums and on Reddit, Google engineer Benson Leung showed that the USB Type-C cable and USB Type-C-to-Micro-USB adapter offered by OnePlus do not conform to the USB specification. OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei on 26 November 2015 admitted that the cable and adapter indeed don't conform to the USB specification, and offered refunds (although not for cables bundled with the OnePlus 2 phone). The company's first product was the highly anticipated OnePlus One. It was unveiled on 22 April 2014, and was claimed as the "2014 Flagship Killer." The One had comparable, and in some ways better, specifications to other flagship phones of the year, while being sold at a significantly lower price at $299 for the 16 GB version or $349 for the 64 GB version. [36] The One also debuted the infamous invite system, which ensured that the company didn't take more orders than it was capable of shipping.. The OnePlus One had several minor hardware issues at launch, which reportedly was corrected in later batches of the phone.. The OnePlus 2 was the successor to the company's highly successful first phone. It was unveiled a little over a year after the One, on 27 July 2015. It was highly promoted as "2016 Flagship killer". There were very high expectations for the second generation OnePlus phones, partly because of the company managed to create a big amount of hype for the upcoming phone. One of the marketing channels used, was YouTube tech reviewer MKBHD , who was sent a unit, which he covered in detail leading up to the launch.. The OnePlus 2 had specifications comparable to other flagship phones of the time, including the highly criticized Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 , though OnePlus had decided to leave out an NFC chip, as it didn't see mobile payment being an essential feature at the time. [37] The phone was also one of the first Android devices to sport a USB type C port over the older micro USB port. The OnePlus X was OnePlus' entrance to the budget phone market, at 5 inches instead of the One and 2's 5.5 inches. The phone was unveiled on 29 October 2015. The phone was sold at $249, and consisted mostly of the same internal components as the year and half old OnePlus One, but had an AMOLED display.. The OnePlus 3 was unveiled on 14 June 2016. The 3 was the company's first "metal unibody" phone. The phone launched with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 , 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of UFS 2.0 storage. [39] The phone was well regarded amongst critics, mostly for its low price and high specifications.. The OnePlus 3T was unveiled on 15 November 2016 as a minor upgrade to the still relatively new OnePlus 3. The upgrade consisted the use of a newer SoC ; the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 was replaced with the Snapdragon 821. Also introduced were a higher-capacity battery, 64 or 128 GB of storage and 16 MP front facing camera. The phone launched in the US on 22 November 2016 and in Europe on 28 November 2016.. The OnePlus 5 was unveiled on 20 June 2017. It launched with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 , a dual-lens camera setup, up to 8 GB RAM, and up to 128 GB of storage. It was released in two colors: Midnight Black and Slate Gray. A third limited edition color, Soft Gold was released on 7 August 2017. [40] Another special edition color was launched on 20 September 2017, in collaboration with Castelbajac. The OnePlus 5T was unveiled on 16 November 2017, as the successor to the OnePlus 5. [42] It features the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC and storage options as its predecessor. Notable feature include a larger 6" 18:9 display, a new "Face Unlock" facial recognition method, and an improved dual-lens camera.. ^ Xiang, Tracey (13 January 2014).

OnePlus 3 review: Finally all grown up. No more excuses — this really is a flagship phone. OnePlus is finally ready to join the big leagues with the OnePlus 3. Gone are the days of justifying missing features with a cheap price, and no longer can we give it a pass for its upstart-style of operation. The OnePlus 3 is the real deal, ready to be compared and evaluated as the flagship phone that it is. It isn't going to wow you with oodles of new features or headline-grabbing, never-before-seen experiences — it's just a downright great smartphone , and that's precisely what most people are looking for.. In a marketplace flooded with great, affordable, high-end Android phones, it's easy to scoff at the disproportionate amount of attention that OnePlus has commanded for the past couple of years. Invite-only sales, questionable quality control, weak customer support and marketing blunders galore have gotten in the way of presenting the company's phones for what they were — really good hardware, backed up by solid software and prices that almost seemed too low.. After the breakout hit of the OnePlus One , the somewhat-forgettable OnePlus 2 was affected most by the company's predisposition for shenanigans, quickly falling off the radar; and the mid-cycle affordable OnePlus X was almost forgotten altogether, even though it was a great phone for the money.. Whether you believe OnePlus has gotten its house in order, you can't deny that the company is no longer a fad nor a flash in the pan ... it's the real deal, and the best example of that is sitting right here in my hand: the OnePlus 3. No longer are we looking at a phone that's "good for the money" or downplaying shortcomings in light of the phone as a whole — the OnePlus 3 is aiming to just be a top-end phone, before you discuss the price or the company behind it.. Does it succeed in that quest? We answer that question here in our complete OnePlus 3 review.. I (Andrew Martonik) am writing this review after 10 days using the OnePlus 3 on T-Mobile in Seattle and San Francisco in areas with good network coverage. The phone arrived on software version A3000_16_160525, and was updated via a 260MB OTA on the final day of the review to A3000_16_160606. The phone was provided to me for review by OnePlus.. A quick special edition podcast supplemental talking about the OnePlus 3!. Looking at the full history of OnePlus phones, you see a very nice progression of materials. After the plastic OnePlus One , there was a metal-framed swappable-back OnePlus 2 , which really stepped up the game, followed by the solid metal-and-glass OnePlus X. Now, we've gone full aluminum with the OnePlus 3.. OnePlus went with what has become a very popular design. With its fourth phone, OnePlus has chosen what has become a very popular design — a minimalist lightly textured silver all-aluminum body, broken only as necessary by solid antenna lines across the top and bottom. Viewed from the back, it's pure minimalism, things aren't much different on the other side. A sheet of Gorilla Glass 4 covers the entire front, save for a small speaker at the top and fingerprint sensor below, curving subtly down to the sides. If you look close you'll see ever-so-subtle shiny chamfers along the edge of the screen, fingerprint sensor, and camera protrusion around back.. The theme continues along the sides —. nothing will particularly catch your eye. A standard oblong power button sits below a SIM card tray on the right side, with a volume rocker on the left accompanied by the OnePlus standard textured three-stage Alert Slider. The bottom has six nicely-drilled holes for the loudspeaker, along with a USB-C port and headphone jack.. You have to applaud such critical hardware execution throughout the phone.. It's understandably difficult to get excited about a phone with a design and materials that we've seen used a countless number of times in the past two years (the HTC One M8 and iPhone 6 perhaps kicking that off). The OnePlus 3 isn't breaking any barriers in design, or trying anything that's particularly new — but the one thing you can say about the way OnePlus has done it is just how precisely it nailed the manufacturing. You can't pick out a single place where it isn't absolutely spot on. Every edge, every join of materials, every cutout, every transition from curve to flat — every placement is perfect. This precision is hardly exclusive to OnePlus nowadays, as just about any manufacturer can now do things with metal and glass that were previously reserved to multi-billion-dollar companies just a few years ago. But just because you can do it now doesn't mean every phone is built as well as the OnePlus 3.. That precise manufacturing comes across in how the phone feels when you pick it up every single time. With a 5.5-inch display the OnePlus 3 is hardly small, but it nestles into the crook of your palm and the flat sides give you just enough to wrap your fingers around to get a sense that the phone isn't going to slide around much. The smooth and gently curved back, which maxes out at 7.35 mm in thickness, isn't ever going to be as easy to grip as the Sandstone-backed OnePlus 2, but this phone in return isn't nearly as harsh on your hand.. It's a pleasure to hold, look at and use.. In a continuing theme, for the third straight year OnePlus has stuck with a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 display. But as is often the case, the numbers don't really tell the story — we're now looking at an AMOLED panel as a successor to the washed-out and lackluster IPS panel used last year, and the benefits are immediately apparent.. This is a really great display — 1080p resolution isn't an issue.. Even without increasing the resolution, OnePlus has dramatically improved things by going with a nicer panel this time around. Gone are the washed-out colors and poor visibility in sunlight, and while the panel isn't quite up to the quality of those selected by Samsung for its own phones — particularly in direct sunlight visibility, because Samsung is tops there — this is a display anyone would be happy to have. It offers good viewing angles and great colors right out of the box, but if you'd like to tweak a little bit OnePlus offers a color balance slider in the settings as well.. And before you try and argue that 1080p isn't high enough of resolution, let's be real — 400 pixels per inch on a screen is plenty; and as I'll get into in further detail in this review, it definitely has benefits when it comes to performance and battery life. At some point you have to consider all aspects of the display, not just focus on resolution, when evaluating it.. The AMOLED screen also plays into the aesthetic of OxygenOS, which has lots of dark colors that really look great on this type of the screen — something anyone who has a OnePlus X can tell you. That goes a step further if you choose to enable the dark mode in the settings and turn on the ambient display mode (familiar to Nexus users) to glance at notifications when they arrive on your sleeping phone.. Underneath the aluminum shell, the OnePlus 3 is filled with plenty of the highest specs you'd expect to see from a top-end phone this year. It all starts with a Snapdragon 820 processor and 6GB of RAM, along with 64GB of storage and a 3000 mAh battery powering it all. There's 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 on-board, and we have NFC again, the first time since the OnePlus One — I used Android Pay as soon as I got the phone.. More: Complete OnePlus 3 spec sheet. The OnePlus 3 is a touch narrower than the OnePlus 2 and OnePlus One, and also thinner, but is just barely taller than its predecessor. It's also the lightest OnePlus flagship so far at 158 grams, about 10% lighter than the OnePlus 2.. If the all-metal build of the OnePlus 3 has you longing for the good 'ol days of the swappable backs, or you just want to have some protection and extra grip from time to time, OnePlus has you covered with a set of protective cases that are built using the same materials previously available on the OnePlus 2. You can pick up a wood veneer case in Rosewood, Black Apricot or Bamboo varieties, or go with a synthetic material in Sandstone or Karbon.. All five cases are form-fitting and minimal in their coverage, but they can all add style, protection and a little extra grip to the aluminum OnePlus 3. Expect to pay about $20 to $25 per case on the OnePlus website. There are also black, grey and sand color variants of a flip cover, which go for $20 each.. With every Android phone launch, there's a very vocal group of people who point to the software as a reason for not considering the phone. Customized non-standard interfaces, carrier-imposed bloatware and delayed updates are always cited as downsides of buying most non-Nexus phones, and this is one area where OnePlus has excelled since it moved away from Cyanogen and to its own software experience called OxygenOS.. Knowing its target audience, OnePlus has crafted software that does what all of the enthusiasts are asking for: it takes a "stock" build of Marshmallow , adds a few features and opportunities for customization, and sends it on its way to the phone. What you get in OxygenOS on the OnePlus 3 just about precisely mirrors the Marshmallow update that just hit the OnePlus 2 — and that's a good thing for those who enjoy a simple, powerful software experience.. If you enjoy what Google has done in terms of design and interface in Android 6.0, you'll love the OnePlus 3 — on the whole, the experience isn't any different from what you'll find on a Nexus phone today. What has changed are a grouping of subtle but powerful features, most of which started as staples in the custom ROM community years ago, and many others introduced or popularized by various other Android manufacturers.. A handful of small features and customizations add up to a great experience.. The bigger changes come in the form of quick customizations of the interface that normally would be set in stone on other phones. You have the ability to edit the quick settings toggles, the status bar icons, the color of the operating system theme, the notification light and the color balance of the screen. If you choose to use the OxygenOS default launcher, you get a nice set of customizations there, from changing icon sizes and app drawer grid sizes, to enabling quick gestures and changing the look of the search bar on your home screen. There's also built-in support for third-party icon packs.. Further, OxygenOS includes a batch of small additional features. You still have the choice of using on-screen or off-screen capacitive navigation buttons and can rearrange them and reassign long-press actions as you like. You can also turn on four different gestures to perform actions when the screen is off.. OnePlus includes its own Launcher, Camera, Music, Gallery and Files apps, but otherwise includes the stock Google apps for their default functions. You can also disable every one of the OnePlus apps if you wish — that means you don't have to bother with disabling a pile of unwanted apps or dealing with duplicates because the default system app can't be removed.. And of course if you aren't satisfied with what OnePlus has created, you can blow it all away and install something else thanks to an unlockable bootloader.. The only thing to really be concerned about here is software updates ... Since moving to in-house software development OnePlus has done quite well in shipping phones with solid software and keeping them updated with small bug fixes and even some monthly security patches (albeit not every month right on time). But it hasn't been up with the leaders in terms of getting large platform-jumping updates out there. As I write this review in the middle of June, the OnePlus 2 that was launched in August 2015 just got Marshmallow two weeks ago. The OnePlus X from November 2015 still doesn't have the latest version of Android.. OnePlus surely has every intention of getting large platform updates out to its phones in a timely matter. It has even previously committed to time frames for updates ... The problem right now is that nothing in the past has shown us that OnePlus can quickly and reliably get large updates out the door to its customers. That's a little worrisome as I watch the progression of the Android N Developer Preview , which will be ready for a full consumer release very soon.. None of the worry about updates should take away from the exceptionally positive view I have of the current software that actually ships on the OnePlus 3, but it's hard to ignore the past here. For as much as I like the software now, I know I'll be itching to have Android N in short order after it's finalized.. Using the Galaxy S7 , Nexus 6P and OnePlus 2 interchangeably the past couple of months, the transition to using the OnePlus 3 for this review was smooth as can be.. Using the OnePlus 3 as my only phone, taking on every single task, I never experienced any stutters, slowdowns, hiccups, app force closes or reboots. The combination of the Snapdragon 820 and 6GB of RAM meant every single app opened quickly, and I can't recall a situation in which an app was forced out of RAM and needed to be reloaded unnecessarily. Every time I checked my memory usage in the settings, my average was just 3GB ... leaving plenty of runway for additional apps.. Setting the OnePlus 3 next to a couple of other modern phones and opening up apps, multitasking and doing a few basic things, my anecdotal experiences were confirmed — this phone is just as fast, or faster, than anything else on my desk right now. There are just a few other things that factored into my daily use as well.. Software performance is right there with the best phones out.. One thing that OnePlus has absolutely cornered the Android market on is with its Alert Slider — this clever little three-stage hardware switch that lets you quickly move between all, priority and no notifications without touching the screen or tuning the phone on. You can explicitly choose what happens in the "priority" and "none" positions, from who can call you, whether media, alarms or events make a sound, and more. It's one of the little tweaks OnePlus has made that improves the experience of using the phone every single day.. Another part of the phone that has been of use every single day is the speaker, where the offerings in other phones can be rather hit or miss. The OnePlus 3's speaker performs admirably even though it's using a single small speaker at the bottom of the phone. It's louder and clearer than the similarly-sized and positioned speaker on the Galaxy S7 , and even though it comes up short of the front-facing speaker setups on the Nexus 6P and HTC 10 , it's loud enough for what I use it for and doesn't distort at higher volumes.. With over a week of experience under my belt I only found two unexpected software bugs — one where the capacitive navigation keys were inexplicably enabled after a reboot (and subsequently back to normal after a reboot), and another where the on-screen "back" navigation button would take a few presses to actually perform the intended action. I assume these two issues are related, and they were so sporadic that I couldn't nail down any one cause. The software I've been using for this review wasn't entirely final, and I received an update on my final day of writing that sized up at 260MB. Presumably this last-minute tune-up will sort out these two random — and honestly not in any way bothersome — issues.. Any time the battery size shrinks from one generation to the next it's an understandable reaction to be worried about battery life. Even though the OnePlus 2 on Marshmallow was very much a fantastic performer in this respect, a drop from 3300 mAh to the 3000 mAh non-removable battery in the OnePlus 3 isn't the direction most of us wanted to see the phone go. But of course, there's more to battery life than just the size of the cell inside.. Through a combination of factors — not the least of which is a more efficient Snapdragon 820 processor and AMOLED screen —. the OnePlus 3 continues to have great battery life just like its predecessor. My average day with the phone, which includes plenty of social networking, dozens of photos, podcast listening, emails and all sorts of typical smartphone uses, left me with about 25% battery after 15 hours. I used the OnePlus 3 just as I would any other phone, with near-max brightness, automatic syncing in every app, full location services and everything else turned on fully — I don't punish the phone, but I don't back off on its capabilities in order to extend battery life.. A 10% decrease in battery size didn't lead to a big drop in battery life.. On a more relaxed day, such as this Sunday that I'm sitting writing this review, at 8:45 p.m. over 12 hours after I unplugged the phone I'm sitting at 58% battery remaining. With several opportunities to take advantage of Marshmallow's battery-saving Doze mode and quite a long time on Wi-Fi today it's been an absolute battery champ.. After over a week of using the phone exclusively I only had a single day in which I needed to charge before going to bed at night — a day that I traveled to San Francisco that included hours of podcast listening, four hours of screen-on time and some hotspotting thrown in for good measure. I still made it from 7 a.m. when I decided to plug in at 10% battery. That's a situation in which normally I'd be plugging in my Nexus 6P while I was on the plane in the late morning and again looking for a charger in the afternoon.. If you end up getting into a situation where battery is draining faster than you'd like, the OnePlus 3 still includes Marshmallow's stock battery saver mode, which will cut back on location services, background data and performance in order to eke out some extra life. You can toggle it on manually, or have it come on automatically at 15% or 5%.. Though most of us have been using some sort of quick charging feature on phones for the past few years, OnePlus is for the first time shipping a phone that offers its own quick charging capabilities. Rather than stick with the most widely accepted standard, Qualcomm's Quick Charge (and its compatible derivatives from the likes of Samsung, Motorola and ASUS, among others), OnePlus has what it calls "Dash Charge" in the OnePlus 2. The idea is that you can still get that quick boost even while you're continuing to use the phone.. The only potential downside here is incompatibility with existing Quick Charge plugs.. A Dash Charge wall plug is included in the OnePlus 3's box (as it should be), and it's rated for 5V/4A, which is higher amperage than most other chargers out there (though the new Moto Z Force Droid Edition will ship with a massive 6V/5A charger).. When you plug in this charger to a OnePlus 3, it can add 60% to the battery in just 30 minutes (and then slows down a bit thereafter), which is a pretty impressive feat. OnePlus says that most of the smarts are in the charger itself, rather than on the phone's end, which purportedly helps with heat management so much that charging speeds don't need to be throttled back even when you're playing a game on the phone. The phone also charges just fine off of any other charger, but you won't get the Dash Charge speeds with a Quick Charge 3.0 charger or the 5V/3A charger from the Nexus 6P .. The Dash Charger comes with a standard USB-A to USB-C cable — with a little "Dash" logo on it — that has a slightly different design from its previous offering. The cable feels quite a bit more robust now, but unfortunately isn't flat like the last one, which I was particularly fond of — it also doesn't have a reversible plug on the USB-A end. You can also pick up a Dash Charge car charger for $30, which is small and offers a single USB output that can charge your OnePlus 3 as fast as the wall plug version. Additional Dash Charge wall chargers will set you back $20, and extra new USB-C cables are $15 each from OnePlus.. There are two SIM slots in the phone, along with dual standby support for incoming calls. Mobile network performance has been right on par with any other phone, as has Wi-Fi. Phone calls were clear and consistent. You don't get headphones in the box. There's a pre-installed screen protector, which you can choose to use or remove (as I did) if you wish. OxygenOS no longer includes MaxxAudio customizations. The vibration motor is pretty sub-par and rattles a little. VoLTE support on T-Mobile is included.. The OnePlus 3's fingerprint sensor, recessed a bit from the front glass underneath the screen, has worked just as well for me as the sensor on the OnePlus 2, Galaxy S7 or Nexus 6P. The sensor is always active so you can put your finger on the fingerprint sensor when the phone is sleeping and immediately unlock to the home screen. And of course with Marshmallow on the phone, any app that supports the operating system's standard fingerprint APIs can be unlocked with a quick tap of the sensor.. I'm not the biggest fan of having the sensor underneath the screen as opposed to in the middle of the back of the phone, but just like Samsung with its Galaxy phones' fingerprint sensors you can't blame OnePlus for keeping the positioning consistent from the OnePlus 2 to the next phone.. There always are a few odds and ends that don't warrant a full review section but need mentioned regardless. There's no shortage of smartphones with great cameras out there, from the Galaxy S7 to the LG G5 and Nexus 6P, onward down the line you'll find phones with quick, capable shooters. The increase in quality in the average camera sensor and availability of solid imaging components has been a rising tide lifting most phones to better and better photos, but the most difficult (and expensive) portion of this equation is often the processing software that handles the raw data taken in by those camera sensors.. The 16MP sensor has relatively small 1.12-micron pixels, and is backed up by an f/2.0 lens and optical image stabilization. On the video side, it can handle 4K at 30 fps, 1080p at 60 fps and 720p at 120 fps.. Quickly launching into the camera with a double-press of the power button, you're greeted by a very basic layout — quick toggles for flash, Clear Image and HDR are on top, and you can tap a settings icon to reveal toggles for grid lines, timers and image aspect ratio. Swiping on the viewfinder quickly toggles to video mode, or you can select one of several shooting modes — including a new full manual mode with ISO, white balance, shutter speed and focusing — from the left-edge menu.. The OnePlus 3 easily has the best camera the company has shipped, and it's even considerably better than the OnePlus 2, which for the money was very capable. Images are captured and processed quickly, and I was very happy with the quality — the resulting images leaned toward natural rather than overly punchy colors, and had the right balance of light for the scene. My only real complaint is that the OnePlus 3 sometimes focused a bit on the soft side, clearly missing the right point of emphasis in the photo.. Easily the best OnePlus camera to date, even if it's not the best in the industry.. Considering the relatively small size of the pixels on the rear camera, I wasn't surprised to see that shots in very low light (such as in the middle of the night) were a bit on the grainy side. But any scene with even a decent amount of light came out clear, whether indoors or out. Even really dark scenes were improved with the use of tap-to-focus and working the exposure manually.. I took advantage of the new auto-HDR mode and wasn't disappointed by the results. After dealing with the sluggish (to the point of uselessness) HDR mode on the OnePlus 2 and X, I was pleasantly surprised to see insanely quick capture times and no blur in HDR mode.. On the front, you have a basic 8MP sensor with the same f/2.0 lens but larger 1.4-micron pixels. The front-facing camera actually performed really well, considering it's a fixed-focus unit that can sometimes leave faces blurry if you get too close. There's also a neat feature to start a three-second countdown timer and capture automatically when the camera detects a person smiling in the photo.. Should you buy it? Yes. On its third attempt at a flagship, OnePlus has finally figured out the winning combination. Much of what made the OnePlus 2 popular is still here — a sizable screen, solid hardware, great internal specs, powerful software, fingerprint sensor, good battery life and the Alert Slider, just to name a few. Then it added plenty of other niceties — quick charging, NFC, camera improvements, advanced hardware design and a much better screen.. The OnePlus 3 is solid, fast, gets great battery life, takes awesome photos and isn't subject to any carrier bloatware or or other software cruft. It very much follows the Nexus model for making a phone.. If there's one knock you can put on the OnePlus 3, it's that the phone doesn't bring any individual feature or experience to the table that we haven't seen from other manufacturers this year. There's very little "wow" factor here. It has all of the same specs, strengths and base features that you can get on half a dozen other great Android phones out there today. Nope, the OnePlus 3 doesn't bring anything particularly new ... but what it does do is execute near-flawlessly on what it has.. And for all of the complaining we do about poorly implemented features, half-baked ideas and bloated software, we should be applauding a phone that simply does what it says it'll do, even if the list is shorter than what you get elsewhere.. With all of the advancements in store this year, OnePlus has bumped up the price to a smooth $399. And even though it's more expensive than it's predecessor, I'm not sure how you can say that the OnePlus 3 doesn't justify its price. At the same time, it has skipped out on offering any sort of different SKUs with changes in RAM or storage — you can simply buy one model of OnePlus 3, and at launch you can only choose one color, silver. Later on, you'll have the choice of a light gold color as well.. OnePlus has finally ditched annoying but previously necessary invite system, and is actually able to take regular online sales for the OnePlus 3. Starting today, June 14, you'll be able to simply buy the phone directly from OnePlus — and sales are open in over two dozen countries to boot.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

OnePlus has replaced its OnePlus 3 with the 3T, a souped up model with a faster CPU and an updated selfie camera. Read our OnePlus 3T review for the full lowdown. I`ve been using the OnePlus 3 as my main phone for three months now, and while the original review below discusses some of the finer points of the OnePlus, my thoughts here reflect long-term, daily use.. The first thing I did with the OnePlus 3 was stick it in a case: I didn’t want a repeat of the mess I made of the metal-backed HTC One M8, which ended its life on eBay as a scratched-up mess with a cracked secondary camera lens. The OnePlus-made carbon-fibre-style case was my preferred choice, since it looks superb and adds hardly any weight or bulk.. The best thing about the OnePlus, for me, is the camera. It’s fast and takes lovely photos both of faces and panoramas. After my primary camera broke on the first day of a two-week holiday, the OnePlus became my go-to snapper and took some truly excellent shots, particularly in HDR mode.. It was on holiday where I also discovered some serious problems with battery life management. Since the majority of my holiday was spent away from Wi-Fi networks, and I didn’t have any need to use mobile data, I set the OnePlus to Airplane Mode. For whatever reason, this set in motion a serious system resources problem that caused the phone to heat up and the battery to drain at a ridiculous rate.. I never got to the bottom of the issue, but what I do know is that isn’t something that’s unique to my device. There were some reports of a similar problem with the OnePlus 2. It didn’t happen every time the phone went into Airplane Mode, but it was frequent enough to be a serious problem.. When not burning itself out, I’ve found the OnePlus 3’s battery to be a little disappointing. If I use it for my hour-long commute, I’ll definitely need to charge it at work – or risk it running flat before the end of the day. If I use it more lightly, checking it only periodically throughout the workday and using it more heavily at home, it is possible to get to the end of the day without issue. Either way, this is a phone I have to charge at least once per day. This is somewhat made up for by the. Elsewhere, I’ve been impressed by the phone’s overall performance, and while its 6GB of RAM never seems to be full, I did find I could keep more apps open at a time without them being killed by Android.. The OnePlus 3 is the best phone I’ve used in years, especially if you consider the price. My biggest bugbear is battery life, but I can just about live with it.. After two previous iterations that were decent but not quite good enough, OnePlus has hit the bigtime with its third iteration. The OnePlus 3 is pretty amazing – a jaw-dropping phone in almost every way that takes the game to the Samsung Galaxy S7 , HTC 10 and even the iPhone 6S .. Previous OnePlus devices offered a slightly compromised experience that, while commendable, wasn’t good enough to convince us they were genuine flagship beaters. As you’ll see from this review, this is no longer the case.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Still, even at this price, it does make you think twice before buying an iPhone 7 outright. It’s also had a couple of updates, including a new gold model and the ability to set the screen to a slightly more subdued sRGB colour mode. It’s not a huge deal, but it gives buyers more choice on how their phone looks, both front and back.. Previous OnePlus devices compromised, but the OnePlus 3 doesn’t. It has a lovely design, fast-charging, NFC for mobile payments and you don’t need a silly invite to actually buy one.. If you want an Android phone off-contract, this might just be the perfect choice.. Each OnePlus phone to date has offered a marked improvement on what has gone before. The original OnePlus One was an all-plastic affair, with a somewhat strange “sandstone” finish. The OnePlus 2 enhanced the body with metal sides, but retained the plastic rear.. The OnePlus 3 offers an upgrade once again, this time by way of a metal and glass design. It’s available in “Graphite” – a muted grey – and its 7.4mm-thick aluminium frame makes this handset a delight to both look at and hold.. A 5.5-inch phone may still not be for everyone, but the OnePlus 3 is among the more manageable phones with such a screen size. The finish is excellent too: the aluminium rear is anodised sports the same type of non-shiny look you’ll find on an iPhone.. I’ve always been a fan of the quirky, instantly recognisable design of the previous OnePlus phones, but have met plenty of folk who weren’t. Those people will be happy to discover that the OnePlus 3 has a far more conventional appearance.. The OnePlus 3 is plainer and prettier than its predecessors, but its quirks remain; they’ve just been relocated. It’s possible to buy super-skinny rear covers with the classic OnePlus sandstone finish, a few different wood finishes or one with a carbon-fibre look. These aren’t ultra-rugged cases, but will protect the aluminium frame from scratches, without adding bulk to the phone.. As is the case with an iPhone, it almost seems a shame to cover up the OnePlus 3’s bare metal. The OnePlus 3 is similar to HTC’s One-series phones but slimmer and no less attractive.. Like the OnePlus 2, this phone has no memory card slot. This time round, however, it isn’t a ploy to make the expensive versions of the phone more attractive. The OnePlus 2 model was available in 16GB and 64GB versions; there’s only one OnePlus 3 and it has 64GB of storage. For some context, the 32GB Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge costs £639 SIM-free, and the iPhone 6S Plus will set you back £699. The OnePlus 3 is half the price of these phones and, as we’ll see, the hardware is directly comparable in several areas.. The OnePlus range is also more accessible than ever before. The OnePlus 3 can simply be ordered online at the OnePlus website – stock allowing – where in the past you had to wait for an invite to buy. In addition, unlike the OnePlus 2, the OnePlus 3 features NFC technology.. This was omitted from the spec in the past, seen as not important enough to warrant the additional cost. However, with the launch of Android Pay, OnePlus has relented. And the move doesn’t appear to have significantly impacted the price.. The OnePlus 3 also has a great fingerprint scanner, which is located in the same position as it is on the OnePlus 2. It’s a non-clicky pad that sits below the screen.. It works whether or not the display is on, and is super-fast. It’s possible to use it as a “Home” soft key, either on-screen or via the physical ones below the screen. The hardware back and “apps” soft keys are marked with tiny white LED dots, rather than full-on icons. This is because you can flip them around too.. A bargain price has always been the main draw of OnePlus handsets, but there’s plenty of customisation on offer as well.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

OnePlus has come a long way since the OnePlus One was released a little more than two years ago. Watching the trajectory of this Chinese startup is like. seeing a child celebrity grow up, shaking off the demands of fame and maturing. But it’s not what the OnePlus 3 has that makes it interesting, but what it doesn’t have. With the release of its third flagship, OnePlus has dropped the invite system and gone from guerilla marketing tactics to a sprint for mainstream success. In this OnePlus 3 review, we’ll see how OnePlus has grown up and begun to settle down.. ✕ Smaller battery than OnePlus 2. OnePlus 3 release date and price. The OnePlus 3 was launched today (June 14, 2016) via the global ‘Loop VR’ event publicized a couple of weeks ago. It will be sold in the US for $399 and Canada for $519. In the UK it’ll cost £309, while in Europe it will set you back €399. It goes on sale tomorrow, June 15, in India for ₹27,999 and also in China for 2499 RMB. We’ll update this section as more availability details are released.. As mentioned, the big news is that the OnePlus 3 will be available invite-free from launch day. This is the first time OnePlus will sell a phone the ‘regular’ way. This is great news if you’ve been frustrated with the system before.. UPDATE: The OnePlus 3 is one of the best smartphones of 2016, but OnePlus has already decided to raise the bar even higher with the new OnePlus 3T, available from November 22. Check out our review of OnePlus’ latest and greatest to find out if it really beats its predecessor, and what the big changes are.. OnePlus 3 design and build quality. The OnePlus 3 is the best-looking piece of hardware OnePlus has made. The soft gold variant of the OnePlus 3. The front of the soft gold version is white. The OnePlus 3 beside the HTC 10. the OnePlus One was a large, sandstone-textured performance beast, the OnePlus 2 had a more. The OnePlus 3 doesn't leap a great distance from its predecessor, but is. another instance of where OnePlus has applied small changes to its formula.. In my opinion, the OnePlus 3 is the best-looking piece of hardware OnePlus has made. At 158g, it’s lighter than either the One or the 2, which are 162g and 175g, respectively. From the back, the anodized aluminum unibody, at 7.35mm in thickness, has an attractive minimal design. The call speaker sits above the display, along with the front-facing camera to its left. To the left of the camera is the notification light.. Beneath the display is a fingerprint sensor, which also doubles as the home button. As with every front-facing sensor like this, you’ll need to take hold of the. device with two hands to give your thumb an accurate aim. The sensor is fast when you get it right (and you mostly will), unlocking in up to 0.3 seconds, according to OnePlus. The sensor also has bling quality with its glossy ceramic construction.. On the left side of the OnePlus 3 is the volume rocker, which sits beneath the notification slider, and on the right side is the sleep/wake button and dual-SIM card tray. All three of these buttons have a pleasingly tactile click. There isn’t much to see on the rear. Beautifully minimal, there is the protruding main camera sensor, flashlight, company logo and the antennas above and below. The combination of hard and soft lines, subtle color variation and even how the anodized aluminum disperses light, give the OnePlus 3 a fine finish.. With a 5.5-inch display, and as with every other phablet, this phone is a little too large to comfortably fit in trouser pockets. Its thinness helps pocketability, but if the issue of practicality is a major one for you, or if you've never owned a phablet before, then you mightn’t get along with the OnePlus 3.. I can’t help but draw a comparison with the HTC 10, as the back of both phones are very similar in appearance. The main difference is that the HTC 10 has chamfered edges, while the OnePlus 3 has rounded ones (see below for a visual comparison). The OnePlus 3 was available in graphite at launch, with. 'soft gold’ made available in the US on July 26, 2016. Here are some shots we took at our headquarters on August 9:. The OnePlus 3 display is good, but only good. The OnePlus 3 display is a 5.5-inch, Full-HD AMOLED panel with dimensions of 1920 x 1080p, giving it a pixel density of 401 ppi (the same pixel density as the previous two generations). The 2.5D screen is made of Gorilla Glass 4, which is reportedly more resistant to shattering than previous iterations but, with that smooth aluminum unibody, I’d still lean towards using a case.. Overall, the display is pleasing to use, with oversaturated colors and deep blacks typical of AMOLED panels. The panel sits very close to the glass and the bezels, at 0.75 mm each, are also small.. We weren’t so impressed with the OnePlus 2’s display, and not much has changed this time around. The panel is adequate, but, in 2016, it’s a little underwhelming. You’ll be satisfied during daily use, but it can’t compete with the richness of the QHD displays you’ll get in a Samsung Galaxy device, or even in a Moto X Pure (now the Moto Z).. While maintaining this resolution has performance benefits, it could be a drawback if you’re interested in pairing it with a VR headset, particularly as OnePlus has now teamed with Ant VR to release the Loop VR headset, which was also sent to me for testing.. Dash Charge is a good addition to the OnePlus 3. This is OnePlus’s first foray into quick charging. The OnePlus 3 has a USB Type-C port for charging. While in our OnePlus 2 review we discussed the introduction of a fingerprint scanner and the surprise dropping of NFC, you’ll be pleased to know that both of these features are in the OnePlus 3. Aside from OnePlus marketing this device as VR friendly, with a global virtual reality launch adding a level of interactivity to the release, the most interesting new feature this time around is Dash Charge.. This is OnePlus’s first foray into quick charging. Dash can charge the battery to 60 percent in around 30 minutes. It does this by moving the bulk of the phone’s power management to the adapter, meaning that most of the heat generation that charging causes is kept away from the phone itself, just like other quick charging setups.. Dash Charge provides you with two main benefits. The first is that you can charge the OnePlus quickly and, in my testing, it took a little more than one hour to reach 100 percent. The second, OnePlus claims, is that performance isn’t throttled as much as with other fast charging systems. This could be handy if you want to continue gaming while the phone charges but, otherwise, is nice to have but mightn’t be of much benefit to you.. But also note that, although Dash Charge is a useful new feature, you'll be stuck carrying around the wall adapter that comes with the OnePlus 3. If you try and use another quick charge adapter, it won't work. Something to bear in mind if you use accessories that might conflict with this.. Battery usage has been normal for us on Oxygen OS 3.2.1. Oxygen OS 3.1.1 is based on Marshmallow. Oxygen OS runs better than ever on the OnePlus 3. I’ve previously had some issues with OnePlus's Oxygen OS user. interface, namely small bugs and choppy animations, when compared to stock Android. Oxygen has matured since last year and now I’d call it a worthy alternative. The OnePlus 3 comes loaded with Oxygen OS 3.1.1, which this review was based on, and was updated to Oxygen OS 3.1.2 a day before launch. If you haven’t tried it yet, this is a skinned version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.. have been released since launch day. it was discovered that the OnePlus 3 was. An update to Oxygen OS 3.2.0 came out in the first week of July and provided minor tweaks to GPS performance, audio playback. Oxygen OS 3.2.1, which was released within the past week or so, was actually a replacement update after OnePlus decided to stop rolling out version 3.2.0. It includes the tweaks of its short-lived predecessor, plus some camera quality and photo gallery improvements, among others. Some reported that it caused severe battery drain, but we haven't noticed this issue, as you can see from a quick snapshot in the images below. Continue reading our software review below.. has the usual customizations that you’d be used to, such as dark mode, along with ‘Shelf’, which you’ll find when swiping right from the home screen. This is OnePlus’s alternative to Google Now on Nexus devices, or Samsung’s inclusion of Flipboard into TouchWiz. You can use it to host a collection of apps, shortcuts and widgets. It’s more or less the same as in previous versions of Oxygen.. Features in Oxygen OS 3.1.1 include night mode, support for custom icon packs and the Marshmallow-derived Doze Mode and app permissions. There isn’t much bloatware to speak of, thankfully, although you’ll find the usual suspects already preinstalled – namely SwiftKey and Google apps like Maps and Chrome.. Oxygen is smoother and steadier than it was last year. Although OnePlus phones have traditionally been popular with the geek set, the OnePlus 3 could be an alternative to the Galaxy S7 Edge, or an iPhone 6s. Its reliability and palpable design give it mainstream potential. But if you’re not satisfied with Oxygen, worry not. Its bootloader is unlocked from the factory, so you can flash ROMs if you’d prefer.. The OnePlus 3 came out on top. The OnePlus 3 is one of the most powerful phones we’ve ever tested. The Basemark X benchmark on medium quality. Both single- and multi-core results on Geekbench 3. Hardware performance is where the OnePlus 3 overperforms. If you expect nothing more from this phone than raw power, whether for intensive gaming or simply to know you have it, then now is a good time to sit up in your seat. Here it is: the OnePlus 3 is one of the most powerful phones. we’ve ever tested at AndroidPIT .. It has a quad-core Snapdragon 820, with two cores clocked at 2.2 GHz and the other two at 1.6 GHz. This is combined with an Adreno 530 GPU, 6 GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. The Snapdragon 820 performs very well in the OnePlus 3, without the throttling burdens that the OnePlus 2 experienced with its easily overheated Snapdragon 810.. I ran a series of benchmarks over several days to test OnePlus 3 processor, graphics and battery performance. They included Vellamo Metal and Multicore, AnTuTu Benchmark, AnTuTu Tester (battery), Geekbench 3 and Basemark X, both in medium and high modes. I ran the tests three times and then calculated an average. What was the final result? The OnePlus 3 performed better than the incumbent number one – the Exynos 8890 variant of the Galaxy S7.. Interestingly, and to be taken with a pinch of salt, the best AnTuTu Benchmark score was 140,573 points. Compare this, also with some skepticism, to the ANTuTu benchmark we ran on the OnePlus 2 last year: around 62,000. This puts the OnePlus 3, at least for now, at the top of the smartphone pile for raw performance. But what does this actually mean?. You won’t be accessing the full processing and graphical capabilities as you view cat pictures in Chrome, or make grey ticks blue in WhatsApp. But if you use power-intensive apps, most probably games, then you can be confident that the OnePlus 3 will run these at high frame rates for at least the next couple of years.. I think that for many potential customers of this phone, owning this power at a significantly lower price than the current stable of flagships is reason enough to buy it. Leaving a Ferrari in the garage doesn’t hurt anyone, after all.. Speaker grille design is cleaner than in previous generations. In its speaker grille design, the OnePlus 3 departs slightly from the OnePlus 2. It has only one bottom-facing grille, which makes sense for its mono-speaker setup. The OnePlus 2 had a second grille to maintain design symmetry rather than channel actual sound, which makes little sense.. Switching to one grille has another benefit, namely that the 3.5 mm headphone jack and one of the microphones have been relocated from the top of the phone to where one of the grilles used to be. This gives the phone a cleaner and more functional design.. Sound quality from the bottom-facing speaker is good, with rich mid-range tones and crisp treble. Don’t go throwing out your Bluetooth speakers just yet, but this is a decent driver that’ll get the job done. Audio call quality is also satisfactory, with the call speaker producing warm tones even at higher volumes, working in tandem with noise-cancelling dual microphones.. View our test image gallery here. Getting consistently sharp details was tricky...optical image stabilization was part of the problem. This is certainly a good camera, but there is better. The front-facing camera is very decent. I found the OnePlus 3 camera to be one of the weaker components in the overall package. On the rear is a 16 MP Sony IMX 298 sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. It features both optical and electronic image stabilization, along with phase-detection autofocus, RAW image support and 4K video capabilities.. The manual controls, such as for aperture and ISO, might suit your needs if you’re a more serious photographer. I’d even recommend increasing the shutter speed if you’re shooting moving objects, as indoor subjects often blurred when I was using automatic mode. Image quality is good overall, but low-light performance wasn’t as good as I’d hoped. Quite a lot of noise appeared on my subjects’ skin.. Sony’s IMX 298 can shoot at very wide-angles. I found this useful indoors, but it led to image distortion when I tried capturing too much information in the frame. Getting consistently sharp details was also tricky, and optical image stabilization was part of the problem.. If you're not used to it, or if you shoot quickly like I do, be aware that a stabilized lens might need a short moment to steady itself after your hands stop moving. Not a problem specific to the OnePlus 3, but there can be slight warping if you press the shutter release too quickly.. The front-facing camera uses an 8 MP Sony IMX179 sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. It’s a decent selfie cam, with ‘Smile Capture’ mode setting off a three-second timer when you smile. I found image and video quality was more than enough for daily needs.. OnePlus 3 battery life is satisfactory. The OnePlus series has always had decently-sized batteries. The OnePlus One has a 3,100 mAh unit, while the OnePlus 2 had 3,300 mAh of capacity. But there is a slight regression with the OnePlus 3, which has only 3,000 mAh. This is a normal size if you go by this year’s flagship cohort, but it’s strange that OnePlus decided to cut here.. I benchmarked the OnePlus 3 battery using AnTuTu’s battery tester, and it performed slightly worse than the Galaxy S7, but better than the HTC 10, both of which have 3,000 mAh batteries. But the OnePlus 3 does have a large display to power, so sticking with Full HD resolution might be one of its saving graces during a time when QHD displays are becoming more common.. Above you can see the benchmark score of 5891. I found battery life to be relatively good, but I was charging it once a day with regular use. This phone is powerful and does chew power when you push it during gaming and YouTube sessions.. Marshmallow’s battery management capabilities, ported into OxygenOS 3.1.1, do help during idle, and Dash Charge makes the recharging process less annoying. As I mentioned in the Special Features section, you can juice up the OnePlus 3 to 50 percent capacity in less than 30 minutes.. 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (401 ppi). HSPA, LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.2. OnePlus has iterated on a compelling formula for three years now. The OnePlus 3 doesn’t differ from what. made its predecessors great; there are upgrades to the hardware each year, upgrades that all manufacturers employ, and sooner or later we buy in. However, this is the first time OnePlus has made a phone with enough design restraint, a smooth enough build of Oxygen OS, so as to be palatable to both tech and non tech-savvy consumers.. This is, for the moment, an unbeatably powerful smartphone. But it’s also well-built enough that this doesn’t even matter. Battery life isn’t outstanding but, then again, not many phones can do much better than daily charging. The camera is good, but it’s not fantastic. If you want to best photos, this is the wrong phone. This is also the wrong price.. But for $399, you’re getting a lot. The OnePlus 3 offers performance, design and value that few manufacturers can. Whether or not it’s upgrade time for you, it’s clear that OnePlus is beginning to settle down as it aims for a more mainstream customer segment. And while it has flaws, the OnePlus 3 is a reliable, refined handset offering. a feature-set that’s hard to match.. Since the release of the OnePlus 3T in November, we've amended our overall score of the OnePlus 3, changing it from 4 stars to 3.5. The OnePlus 3 is still a good phone, but the hardware improvements of the OnePlus 3T make it the. better phone for only $39 more. of the 3T for more details.. OnePlus 3 - where to buy?. I currently own the OPO3 , I like it but there is a part of me willing to give up some of the latest specs to just test out the Nexus 6p, for one reason, the larger screen alone, that's about it. I believe cameras between the 2 are pretty much equal. I have been happy w the opo3 camera so far and I really like the phone. Just not sure the Nexus 6p can last me 2 years as I need current phone to do. With the OPO3 I think it will easily as my OPO lasted 27 mths before selling but no need for 2 handsets. Tuff decision as my 3 is just a month old but the 6p looks nice but is a generation behind in gpu, and snap 810.. HAI there, need your opinion on zenfone 3 (4G) VS ONE plue 3, which 1 is better in gaming, battery, processor, speed , durability , and price.. i need phone for long term use.. Tech specs aside, OnePlus team deserves a lot of kudos for building up a solid reputation and demand for their phone. Their marketing and product teams did a great job.. And yet another USB C port that doesn't meet USB 3.1 standards. Is it another junky cable too?. This phone is starting to grow on me... I kind of want it, but then again, as others have pointed out: no damn SD card slot.. I have owned 2 OPO devices the original and now the 3, both times the 64gb storage is more than adequate. Not once have I run into issue of space. I find the more space the more junk you load and store , apps upon apps that are useless. Figure what you need and when done w movies you may have brought for a trip or music delete it and reload new stuff. 64gb is plenty but that's my opinion.. It is very powerfull machine ,but I miss micro card to extend the memory. I agree and wish it had microSD support. But after living without it, I also realized that 64 GB is plenty of storage. Any more and I'd never bother backing up my data and probably forget what was in there.... To be fair, your statement is incorrect. Especially for us that still download music as mp3 and mp4 files, also while stocking up on other things. But I believe that more modern people, like yourself, will be fine without an SD card since nowadays we live in this "Cloud Storage" world.. well well, oneplus is good but S7 E is better. And hundreds of dollars more, but you are actually incorrect, the OP3 is faster in every speed test. I differ on the "need two hand to use the finger print sensor" I configure mine the same way I would hold my phone with one hand (with my fat thumb) and it's super fast and super reliable. I don't need to hold it with two hands to unlock my oneplus 3. I agree that battery life is really disappointing... I barely made it to sunset with a 5-15% charge on a regular to light usage of my phone.... I'm not certain where your unit went wrong with the camera. It's a great performer, even in tricky lighting. Focusing is faster than the Nexus 6P and image quality is on par with either the 6p or S7.. I got news that the Oneplus 3 will feature Android N. I am curious about when will the phone be available. I just bought an affordable Android 6.0 smartphone, Bluboo Maya and then will use this Android M OS first.. How do we use multiwindow options in one plus three.... Well, I definitely agree that OnePlus may have been really studying the HTC 10's design for their 3rd phone. Personally, I don't like the design unfortunately, add to that the bulky camera module at the back. Hardware-wise though versus.com/en/oneplus-3-vs-htc-10 , they're very similar for the most part, but the OP3 is still better with a higher resolution QHD as opposed to the FHD of OP3. an external memory slot is present as well, and some other minor advantages. Though with the price of 400USD, the OP3 is hard to resist.. It’s about time for a smartphone without compromises. A smartphone conceived and built by tech enthusiasts, hand-in-hand with users. A smartphone born from amazing technology, design, and innovation. It’s about time for the OnePlus 3. *Moderator's note: comment edited due to violation of community terms.. What about sound quality and volyme in the headphone output? Obviosly that also depends on the quality of the headphones themselves, but I want the volume to be as loud as possible when training in the gym since my hearing is a little impaired....today I use a LG G3 with sennheiser headphones.. Lars, I listen to music at work between taking calls on my sennhisser earphones, volume is poor compared to my old nexus 5, I also use when up against noise from construction sites and london traffic while walk ing and volume isn't up to standard. Plus my touch screen doesn't work consistently , one area is particularly poor , so it's going back for refund.

OnePlus has been trying to craft a full-blown, "flagship killer" of a smartphone since day one, but how successful it's been is up for debate. From my perch, the company's first phone proved that a relatively unknown startup could build a high-caliber handset and a die-hard fanbase around it. Its second-generation device pushed it even further into the big leagues. And now there's the $399 (£309) OnePlus 3, which launches today.. Make no mistake: The competition is even fiercer than ever, but OnePlus is trying to meet the challenge. Best of all, that pain-in-the-ass invite system is finally gone. Suffice to say, this year's launch is a big deal for OnePlus, and it's only fitting that the OnePlus 3 mostly represents this young company at its best. Indeed, right now you'd be hard-pressed to find any other phone this good for this price.. Mostly stock Android, plus some neat features. Ships with a few minor bugs. Dash charger doesn't work with all cables. OnePlus is back with its third-generation flagship phone, and it has more than enough horsepower to duke it out with devices twice its price. The phone's construction feels first-rate too, and OxygenOS -- the custom version of Android it runs -- could easily please stock aficionados and dedicated tweakers. It's not perfect, though: You only have one choice for storage (64GB) and the included super-fast charger sometimes isn't super-fast after all. Still, considering what the company is asking and how great everything else is, the OnePlus 3 represents the best balance of price and performance you can find.. There's no denying that last year's OnePlus 2 was a well-constructed device, but it now looks like the days of sandstone polycarbonate are over. This year's version is milled from a single block of "space-grade" aluminum, and the 5.5-inch 1080p AMOLED display up front is swathed in a very slightly curved pane of Gorilla Glass 4. More than that, its trim waistline -- 7.35 mm -- makes the OnePlus 3 feel sleeker and more elegant than you might expect from a phone with this big a screen. Think of it as a larger, much better OnePlus X and you're on the right track. Oh, and in case you were worried, you can still purchase a sandstone case or an authentic bamboo case for old time's sake; or you can go for the fancy black apricot version, rosewood version (both using real wood veneers) or Kevlar version.. The move might have been an obvious one -- OnePlus wanted a cohesive design across its devices -- but who cares? The result is a handsome, impeccably well-built smartphone. A few of my colleagues even mistook it for an HTC device, which I took as a compliment, considering how insanely devoted that Taiwanese company is to build quality. (Obviously, that statement is open to interpretation.) Anyway, yes, OnePlus has really upped its game this year. By the way, our review unit was attractive graphite gray, but a "soft gold" option will follow not long after launch. Seriously, does every company need to make a gold phone?. Gallery: OnePlus 3 review | 27 Photos. What's inside the OnePlus 3 is pretty impressive, too. Just about every flagship Android phone released this year packs one of Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon 820 chipsets and an Adreno 530 GPU. The OnePlus 3 does too, but there's a twist here: It also comes with 6GB of RAM. In fairness, the OnePlus 3 isn't the first smartphone we've seen that packs that much RAM -- that would be the ZTE Axon 7 -- but it's still nice to see a scrappy startup go somewhere most major manufacturers haven't.. Speaking of, the OnePlus 3 also accepts two nano-SIM cards for multiple lines of service. It's rare to see dual-SIM phones in the US, and the feature makes the OP3 a lovely travel companion, but that second SIM card takes up the space one might expect a microSD card to occupy. I'm not sure whether the team specifically gave up on expandable memory to accommodate another SIM; either way, you're stuck with 64GB of storage. I'm a bit of a digital pack rat, though, so having more storage options would've been nice. Oh, and the physical alert slider is back, making it easy to manage your notification sounds without mashing on the volume buttons. I loved that little thing when it debuted on the OnePlus 2, and I love it just as much this year.. The rest of the spec sheet is pretty typical of modern flagship phones. There's a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer on the bottom, a 3,000mAh battery inside, a snappy and accurate fingerprint sensor that doubles as a home button and a pair of capacitive navigation buttons on either side of it. Above the screen sits an 8-megapixel camera for selfies, paired with a 16-megapixel main camera around the back. Oh, and unlike last year, the OnePlus 3 has an NFC radio for all those sweet, sweet Android Pay transactions .. I was half-hoping this was the year OnePlus would trick its flagship out with a Quad HD display, but that just wasn't meant to be. After all, building a phone like this for just $399 (£309) means trade-offs were inevitable. That doesn't mean the screen hasn't been improved. Rather than use an IPS LCD like it did last year, the company went with a 5.5-inch, 1080p Optic AMOLED display (the better to see VR content with a Loop headset, my dear). The switch leaves us with the same pixel density (401 ppi) and thus the same sharpness, but also punchier, more vivid colors. Blacks are especially deep, and whites are pretty crisp by default, but you have the option to make the display warmer or cooler depending on your preference.. Not enough? You can also turn on a proximity wake feature similar to what Motorola offers, where you can wave your hand over the screen to activate parts of it to display the time and notifications. Too bad it's not as accurate or as elegant as what Motorola has built; the feature works best with slow, deliberate waves, while a Moto X will wake up with even quick waves.. Alas, the OnePlus 3's single bottom-mounted speaker doesn't fare much better than the one we got last year. Audio is generally pretty clean, and you can crank up the volume surprisingly high, but things can get a little muddy if you do. The MaxxAudio equalizer we got with the OnePlus 2 is conspicuously absent, so you can't tweak audio levels right out of the box, but I can't imagine too many people used it in the first place.. If you spent only a few minutes with a OnePlus phone, you'd be forgiven for thinking it ran a stock build of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. The OnePlus 3 again runs OxygenOS, a modified version of Android I like to refer to as "stock plus"; there are plenty of additional features that don't cross the line into bloat. The overall effect is more subtle than other companies' approaches, and I think it's more valuable as a result.. The most obvious addition is the so-called Shelf, and you'll catch wind of it first because you're asked if you want it during initial setup. When you swipe right from your home screen, you're treated to the date, local weather, recently used apps and contacts you've been in touch with lately. There's a memo function too, for leaving yourself quick notes (with the option to create reminders from them), and the space serves as a neat place to add widgets without cluttering up your home screens. The Shelf first appeared on the OnePlus 2, and I've mostly ignored it since then, but some will certainly find it handy. Throw in some perfectly adequate Gallery and Music apps and you've got the most obvious additions to the usual Android formula.. Gallery: OxygenOS screenshots | 26 Photos. The fun stuff, however, can require a keener eye. There's an option to invert colors and enable a Night mode in the quick-settings tray; the latter is meant to reduce eyestrain and preserve the sanctity of your sleep cycle by giving the display an orangey cast. It's a good idea in theory, but the execution leaves much to be desired. You're supposed to be able to tweak how warm you want the Night mode display to be from the device's settings, but sometimes that doesn't work and the phone does whatever it wants. By the way, if your eyes just don't like light colors, you can toggle a Dark mode that replaces Marshmallow's bone-white menu and app-launcher backgrounds with stark black.. Customization options go even further: You can modify Android's accent color, icons packs, the notification LED's color, what the home and capacitive buttons do when long-pressed and double-tapped. And if you don't like those capacitive buttons, you can turn them off completely and use on-screen buttons instead. Drawing gestures on the screen while it's off works the same this year; when the function is enabled, tracing a circle launches the camera, and doodling a V fires up the flashlight. I'll admit it: I totally forget about them at first, but it wasn't long before I was whipping the OnePlus 3 out of my pocket and launching the camera with a swipe of my thumb.. Ultimately, that's what I really dig about OxygenOS: if you want a more traditional, stock Android experience, it's there for the taking. But if you're a power user, or just want a little extra control over your phone, there's plenty of extra functionality waiting for you.. Smartphone makers agonize over their cameras, and with good reason -- chances are it's going to get plenty of use, and it's easy to let people down. OnePlus was limited by cost, so it went with a 16-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture lens from Sony, and you know what? It's perfectly adequate. Colors were bright and mostly well saturated (they occasionally came out a little weak), with a more than respectable amount of detail. You can get a little more nuance out of shots if you use an included HD mode, or output them as unprocessed RAW files.. I was concerned at first that the OnePlus 3 would fare worse than last year's model in low light because the size of the sensor's pixels has shrunk from 1.3 microns to 1.12 microns, but it's basically a wash. In the end, the OnePlus 3's main camera is a solid utility player; it's pretty good in every situation, but it certainly won't open your eyes the way other smartphone cameras can..

In addition to having optical image stabilization, the OnePlus 3's camera also has phase-detection autofocus (like the OnePlus X), which makes locking on to subjects nearly instantaneous. It's too bad, though, that OnePlus did away with the laser autofocus module from the OnePlus 2 -- the cost of the 3's other components probably made the team cut it. The phone also ships with a manual mode that offers access to ISO, shutter speed, exposure and focus settings. Thankfully, shooting in full auto is just about always good enough.. The same can be said for the 8-megapixel front-facing camera, which consistently produced handsome selfies. Even better, there's an option for a smile detection mode that usually does a fine job detecting grins on your face and initiating a selfie countdown. It's not as good at noticing subdued, coy smiles, so just grin and bear it for a moment until the countdown begins.. As you'd expect from a phone with a first-rate list of specs, the OnePlus 3 just flies. My week of testing involved putting the phone through my usual workday routine, plus lots of extracurricular time playing Real Racing 3, Mortal Kombat X and Hearthstone. None of that stuff managed to faze the OnePlus 3 -- not even the sort of frenzied multitasking that only ever happens when I'm trying to break a phone.. Really, the best compliment I can pay the OnePlus 3 is that after a while, I stopped noticing how fast it was; everything just worked. It's still not the quickest-feeling phone I've used recently, though. That honor goes to HTC's 10 because of its super-low-latency touchscreen; it's so good, it feels like you're pushing the pixels around yourself. By comparison, there's just the faintest hint of latency when swiping around the OnePlus 3's interface, though I'm probably being a little picky here. After all, that's the sort of distinction that's apparent only if you've spent time playing with loads of new phones; few will take issue with what OnePlus brought to the table.. Same goes for the battery, mostly. It's never fun to see a company use a smaller battery in the next iteration of its flagship device, but that's exactly what happened here: There's a 3,000mAh cell in the OnePlus 3, down from 3,300mAh in the OnePlus 2. Normally that'd be cause for much wailing and gnashing of teeth, at least in my house. Fortunately, the shift hasn't really changed much here. In our standard video rundown test (looping a video with the screen brightness set to 50 percent and WiFi connected), the OnePlus 3 stuck around for nine hours and 56 minutes, or about 50 minutes more than what its predecessor could muster. That's not much less than the HTC 10 and LG G5, but flagships like the Galaxy S7 siblings pack enormous batteries that last more than 13 hours in the same test.. Day-to-day use is a different story, though. The OnePlus 3 typically finished a 12-hour workday with about 25 percent charge left, and even if I forgot to charge it, I could usually count on it to see me through an early lunch the next day. On the occasions you'll need to charge the OnePlus 3 mid-slog, be sure to use the included Dash charger and cable -- the company says they can take the device from bone-dry to about 60 percent full within 30 minutes.. In fact, Dash is actually Oppo's VOOC tech rebranded. In this case, it uses a fast 4A current but with the regular 5V voltage, which keeps the device cooler than those based on other fast-charge technologies that use higher voltages; plus VOOC's charging speed remains the same when the device is being used, unlike others which require lowering the voltage then. The downside of this is you need to use the bundled 7-pin USB cable to make full use of the Dash charger. As I write this, I have the OP3 connected to its original charger with a Nextbit USB Type-C cable, and it's not charging even close to the advertised speed.. I've spent a decent chunk of this review comparing the OnePlus 3 with the HTC 10 and the Galaxy S7 siblings , but that's not terribly fair. While they all share the same flagship ambitions, don't forget that the OnePlus 3 only costs $399 (£309). That's both a huge selling point and a hindrance; the former doesn't need much explaining, but component and feature restrictions because of price mean the OP3's competitors can bring more to the table. Ultimately, here's how I'd break it down: If money is no object and you need a tremendous camera, get a Galaxy S7. If money still isn't an object and you're a sucker for great multimedia chops and build quality, get an HTC 10.. If you want an experience that gets awfully close to what those two devices can offer, and can live with a few trade-offs, the OnePlus 3 is a tantalizing choice for the price. The performance gap between these phones basically doesn't exist, which frankly is sort of crazy when you think about it. The lone, seemingly direct competitor to the OnePlus 3 is ZTE's Axon 7, with the same Snapdragon chipset paired with a Quad HD screen and 4GB of RAM for $449. That's not a bad premium to pay for a higher-res screen, but it's unclear whether the Pro version with 6GB of RAM will even make it to the States. Hopefully we'll get a chance to see how these two devices stack up soon.. At the end of the day, no phone is perfect, and the OnePlus 3 doesn't try to be. What it does try to do is capture the essence of a flagship smartphone -- impeccable performance, smart software and top-notch build quality -- and squeeze it all into an affordable package. You can certainly do better if you're fine with spending more money, and there are better deals to be found if you're not a stickler for high-end performance. The careful balance OnePlus has struck here is impressive, though, and while the OnePlus 3 isn't for everyone, anyone looking for high quality without the corresponding price should start their search here..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars Very Disappointed, both in Oneplus and the Seller. Format: Wireless Phone Accessory | Verified Purchase. The biggest problem with ordering this phone is that you do not know if you're going to receive the Chinese or North American model. Oneplus gave the Chinese and North American versions of the phone the same model number, which is A3000. Considering that the Chinese and North American versions of the phone do not support the same bands, consumers are at a big disadvantage in knowing what phone will work for their region. My phone shipped from the seller Mobiles International LLC, and they absolutely dropped the ball in selling a domestic Chinese phone as an international model. I'm paying for an LTE connection from AT&T, which I am unable to access from my Oneplus 3 due to the seller's incompetence. There is no problem with selling a Chinese version of the phone, but to pass it off as an international version that uses completely different bands than described in the description is fraudulent. I recommend that you do not buy your phone off of Amazon if you're looking for the North American version of the Oneplus 3. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Don't buy this phone in the US unless you are 100% sure it will work with your carrier. Format: Wireless Phone Accessory | Verified Purchase. Be very careful purchasing this in the US. It states this is compatible with ATT and Sprint. However, it DOES NOT connect to AT&T's LTE network. If you are an AT&T customer, you will be buying a very expensive 3G phone. I thought this was an AT&T problem and worked with them. Then I went to OnePlus and they told me I had purchased a phone built for the Chinese market. Understood it was an International phone, but the details in the description indicating this would work with AT&T were misleading. This should not be sold to US customers without some very specific details on how to verify it will work with your carrier.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Format: Wireless Phone Accessory | Verified Purchase. They do not work with USA 4g/lte. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars One of the Best Android Phones Available Right Now. In 2014 the cell phone market was controlled by expensive android phones, struggling to outshine Apple. In the US the system was fueled by carrier incentives that kept people paying a premium for phones by building them into the consumer’s monthly plan. If you wanted to break free from that cycle you had two choices. You could buy a low end droid or you could pay through the nose and buy an unlocked flagship. Then the OnePlus One was released. OnePlus hit the nail on the head with the One. Premium hardware, great software, and a price that was half what some of the other flagships were charging. Sure, the phone had a few issues, but those were easily overlooked when you stepped back and looked at the overall value you were getting. The OnePlus Two arrived a year later. The hype drove the phone to success, but it was not flagship killer and it had some really glaring issues. The term “flagship killer” became a joke. The Two looked good, had okay hardware, and was built solid, but it was plagued by a half-baked OS, missing features, and an invite system that artificially drove the price up on the secondary market. Now we have the OnePlus Three (I’m skipping the X. It’s not a flagship rival and was never intended to be such a thing). OnePlus finds itself in a scary position. Gone is the hype of being the new guy. Also gone is top notch reputation. Now OnePlus has to prove that it wasn’t a one hit wonder. It has to prove that it’s more than a fad. It also has to find a way to win back some of its fan base. A fan base that has been alienated by poor customer service, absurd contests targeted at them, and software updates that rival Samsung for some of the slowest in the industry. The OnePlus Three is the phone OnePlus should have released last year. That is to say, finally OnePlus has made something better than the OnePlus One. It took two years but they finally surpassed the standard they set with the OPO. This phone has some issues, but before we roll our eyes and move on, let’s look at what this thing is made of. BUILD The OPO felt premium despite the fact that it was mostly plastic. You can’t release a plastic phone today and label it as “premium”. In the case of the Three, OnePlus decided to copy and paste from some of its competitors. The Three looks like a hybrid between an iPhone 6 Plus, and HTC M9 and a HTC 10. Basically it looks like someone gave the M9 a shot of steroids, popped out its camera, and made the camera square instead of a circle. Look at the front and it’s hard to tell the difference between the HTC 10 and the Three. The only striking difference is the size (the three is larger). When you hold this phone in your hand, it feels like an iPhone 6Plus. If you are going to copy someone, I guess it’s a good idea to copy the best when it comes to that. My only real complaint is the camera bump, but I’ll explain why later. HARDWARE I’ll keep this second short. At the time of this writing, the OnePlus Three has some of the best hardware you can get in a cell phone. In fact, some parts of it are ground breaking. I do question their thinking though. Why do I need 6GB of RAM? How many people are going to utilize that? I guess if your software is an awful memory how you might need it, but I have a laptop that runs quite fast and it only has 4GB of RAM. I think many people would give up one or two GB of RAM for more than 64GB of storage or… A SD SLOT! Really?!? You can put in dual SIM support, but it’s too much to get an SD slot? I will give OnePlus one thing. They finally admitted that a lot of people use NFC and they put it back in one of their phones. The final hardware related item I will mention is their notification slider. OnePlus is the only phone maker that copied Apple’s notification switch. They didn’t just copy it, they greatly improved on it. For anyone who is in and out of meetings, being able to switch your alert mode instantly is really handy. It’s an awesome thing to steal and I’m amazed more phone makers haven’t gotten on board with it yet. So how fast is the OnePlus Three? When you run the bench marks you will find that, on some tests, it beats the Galaxy S7, HTC 10, LG G5, and Nexus 6P. In other words, it’s balls out fast. DISPLAY The OnePlus One had a mediocre display. The Two didn’t do much to improve on that. The display has always been a weak point for OnePlus. To counter that, OnePlus switched to a 1080p AMOLED display on the Three. This display doesn’t surpass the newest Samsung phones, but it’s a brilliant, colorful display that is even usable in sunlight. Some people turn their nose at the display because it’s 1080p. Those people deserve to be suckered into the hi res hype. The vast majority of people cannot see the difference between 720p and 1080p…on a 50” TV, unless the press their face against the screen. Unless you whip out a 10x magnifying glass, you are not going to be able to see the difference between a 1080p and a 1440p on a 5.5 inch screen. Too many people equate resolution with quality. If you stack a 1080p AMOLED next to a 1440p LCD, and ask people which is the higher resolution, most people will pick the 1080p AMOLED. There is a BIG benefit of selecting a 1080p over a 1440p. Other phone makers know that too. HTC popped a higher res LCD in the 10, but added an app that will reduce the res down to 1080p for games and media, in an effort to save the battery life. Overall the display in the Three is a remarkable jump in quality. The display is no longer a drawback of buying a OnePlus. Granted it's not quite as crisp as the display on most of Samsung's phones, then again, Samsung is the best in the industry when it comes to that. CAMERA OnePlus likes create hype around their cameras. Their cameras have always been simply adequate. The past cameras barely hit the middle of the pack and came nowhere near the quality that Apple and Samsung was providing. The camera in the Three is best camera OnePlus has ever put in one of their phones. What does that mean? It means it doesn’t suck as much as it’s past phones. How’s that for a compliment? This camera would have been a flagship camera in early 2014. Right now it’s once again the middle of the pack. The sensor isn’t as big as its rivals. The pixel size shrunk when compared to the previous model. The aperture doesn’t match its rivals. This camera has some bells and whistles, but so do the others and they have been hardware. But, this camera can record in 4k! That’s something nice to shine up, turn sideways, and shove it where the sun doesn’t shine. Forget the absurdity of recording 4K video with a sensor that small and hardware this middle of the pack. Forget that 4K is foolishly overkill (and will be for a long time). Why would I want to record 4K videos on a phone with a fixed amount of internal storage and no expandable storage? Why would I want to shoot 4K on a camera with only a 3000mah, non-swappable battery? But, how do the photos match up? To be honest they are not bad. That sounds good, but they lag behind the photos you can get with the iPhone 6, 6S, Galaxy S6, S7, LG G5, HTC 10, and Nexus 6P. The quality does beat the Moto X Pure, but that’s not very hard to do. The camera does have a nice set of options to play around with and also has a decent manual mode. SOUND If sound is really important to you, buy the HTC 10. If it’s somewhat important to you, but the HTC 10, Nexus 6P, HTC 9, HTC 8, or Moto X Pure. The speakers in the Three are better than the One or the Two, but again, that’s not saying much. The speakers get the job done. You’ll get your standard sound out of the headphones, but keep in mind that MAXX Audio was removed from the newest version of Oxygen OS (Which the Three runs). SOFTWARE My daily driver is an HTC 10, because I a software that is mostly bloat free and close to pure droid. I you add stuff in, it better be an enhancement and not just bell and whistles (I’m looking at you Samsung!). The original Oxygen OS (OnePlus’s in house version of Android) was not great. It was buggy and app crashes were common. I have to say the newest version of Oxygen OS is fairly smooth. It’s basically stock android with a bunch of customization options added. I would say it’s one of the best android skins except for one glaring issue. For a skin that is so close to stock, I cannot fathom why it takes OnePlus so long to push out updates. The OnePlus two just got its Marshmallow update in late May / early June. The OnePlus X still doesn’t have it. If you buy this phone, I would not expect to see Android N until June / July of 2017. MISC Lots of phones have fast charging. It sounds like a gimmick but it kinda works. If your phone is dead or nearly dead, Dash Charge will get you to 60 to 65% in half an hour. It slows down once you hit that mark, but it’s impressive. I’m just a little concerned that they are ignoring some standards when it comes to USB C to accomplish this. That might sound like a paranoid statement, but OnePlus pretty much ignored the standards when it came to the USB C with the Two. Let’s hope they didn’t do that again. I’d say it’s on par with the Nexus 6P, iPhone, and Galaxy phones, but isn’t quite as good as the HTC 10. OnePlus has a bunch of custom cases, buy they don’t offer a lot of protection. You do not get headphones with the phone. OVERALL To be honest, the OnePlus Three is in the top ten, and possibly the top five Android smartphones you can buy right now. OnePlus finally got back on track and nailed a phone. So should you but this phone? This might answer that question – one of the best smartphones for hundreds less than the others. You can get his phone, unlocked and contract free for $399. The HTC 10 retails at $300 more than that. The Galaxy S7 and LG G5 are hundreds more too. In terms of value, the OnePlus Three is the best cell phone available right now. UPDATE #1 BATTERY I was a little disappointed that the OP3 came with only a 3000mah battery. I would have liked to seem them make the phone a little thicker, embed the camera, and use a larger battery. If they had, the OP3 would have been top notch when it came to battery life. So far it manages to match the HTC 10, which puts it in the "average" range for today's flagships. In the end they choose form over function when it came to the battery..

Don't fall for this crap, the phone is listed as US version, I was not able to get 4G LTE in it, the best I got was 3G. After I chat with OnePlus support,they informed me that the phone that I have is Chinese version and it doesn't support the NA bands. I tried different sim cards and different carriers. I spent hours trying to figure out a way to unlock the 4G LTE band, to no available. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Really happy with this phone. Format: Wireless Phone Accessory | Verified Purchase. Wish I would have done a little more research on this phone and newer models like the 3T that came out several months after the 3 was released then the 5 that was just released. As of now, the only thing I wish would have been a little better is the Power Consumption. I know the 3T is a slightly newer Snapdragon processor which boasts better power consumption but when I decided to buy this I didn't think it was going to be to large of a difference. I will say the fast "Dash" charge is pretty nice. To sum things up, I'm happy with this phone for someone looking to buy a One Plus now, it's probably worth paying the extra $ and going with the One Plus 5..

After a lot of time investigating and comparing, I've decided that the OP 3 was the phone for me, and I'm really happy that I chose it. After almost 3 months of use, it still works as new, has no problems running any app, and it's updated to Oreo. The alert slider is really useful. Things I liked the most: - Physical capacitive buttons for back, recents and home (this was really important to me, as I don't like these buttons using screen space) - Volume slider, really useful - 64GB of internal storage, being used to 8GB on a 2nd generation Moto G - The camera. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?.

Android 6 and OxygenOS nicely combined, without software bloat. Fast charging adds useful extra features. Fast charging requires OnePlus power brick and cable. Conclusions OnePlus 3 first look: 10 reasons to choose it over a Samsung, LG, HTC, or iPhone Flir One review: Thermal imaging on your smartphone Huawei P9 camera deep dive: Is the Leica brand and dual-camera design worthy of the hype?. The OnePlus 3 isn't faultless, but for £309 (inc. VAT) its imperfections can be classed as minor niggles: it's without doubt the best smartphone in its price range right now. One caution for buyers in the UK: if you're tempted by the OnePlus 3, get your order in as soon as possible, in case the volatile state of the GB pound following the unexpected EU referendum result forces the company to raise the price .. The OnePlus 3 has an aluminium unibody design that gives it the appearance of a flagship handset. By contrast, the OnePlus 2 was a design copy of the original OnePlus One, with a grip-friendly finish to the back that I likened to 'wet and dry sandpaper'. Getting the OnePlus 2 out of its box for a comparison reinforced that original impression.. The 5.5-inch OnePlus 3, which weighs just 158g, is powered by a Snapdragon 820 processor with a generous 6GB of RAM. Its Dash Charge feature can deliver 60 percent of a full charge in 30 minutes.. Looks matter, and the OnePlus 3's design is a big advance. But there's more to the aluminium unibody than just looks. It's a tough material that's reasonably grippy, although downside is that it lacks individuality -- it most resembles the HTC 10 at first glance.. The OnePlus 3 fits a 5.5-inch screen into a chassis that's 152.7mm tall and 74.7mm wide. There's almost no bezel at all on the screen's long edges. The handset is just 7.35mm thick and weighs 158g. These are pared-down dimensions, and it's no wonder that the camera lens protrudes a couple of millimetres from the back of the chassis as a result.. The high build quality carries over into the side buttons: the power button is on the right edge and the volume rocker on the left, and both are firm and responsive.. Above the volume rocker is a welcome feature carried over from the OnePlus 2 -- the Alert Slider. This has three positions corresponding to all, priority or no notifications. The slider needs a fair push to move it, so there's no danger of accidentally making selections when the phone is in a pocket, and it gives a little click when pushed into position. The click is a small thing, but many will feel it's a premium-grade feature. The slider's pocked finish makes it easy to find just by touch, and I was able to switch between modes without taking the handset out of a pocket.. The Alert Slider above the volume rocker lets you quickly switch between notification preferences -- all, priority or none.. A ceramic button beneath the screen returns you to the home screen from other activities with the gentlest of touches. It contains a fingerprint scanner, and OnePlus says you can use a fingerprint to unlock from sleep in 0.2 seconds. I couldn't measure that time, but can confirm that it's very fast.. The 3.5mm headset slot is on the bottom edge, next to a speaker that delivers fair quality at the highest volume level. The USB Type-C port for battery charging is also on the bottom edge.. The longevity you'll get from the 3,000mAh battery obviously depends on your usage pattern. After few days' testing with relatively light workloads, I found it would last through the day with no trouble, and might even get half-way through the next day. That's not class-leading, but it is above-average.. What really lifts the OnePlus 3 into the realms of better battery performance is Dash Charge. This is the name for OnePlus's take on fast charging. The charge cable and power brick combo supplied by OnePlus can deliver more than 60 percent battery charge in half an hour. That's impressive, and I found it worked well.. Moreover the charging combo is designed to handle most of the heat generated when charging, keeping the handset cooler and avoiding the need to throttle back the processor. That's useful if users want to continue processor-heavy activities while charging. The downside is that to take advantage of all this requires carrying the OnePlus charge cable and power brick in addition to any generic chargers.. As already noted the OnePlus 3 has a 5.5-inch screen. The full-HD (1,920 by 1,080) resolution is not leading edge, but it's perfectly adequate for delivering even full-screen video at a good enough quality to watch with satisfaction. At 401 pixels per inch (ppi), text looks fine too, and the AMOLED technology delivers saturated colours. Indeed, OnePlus has tweaked AMOLED into a version it calls Optic AMOLED -- essentially, OnePlus has tweaked the contrast and colour temperature of a regular Super AMOLED panel. I can't say I noticed a stunning uplift in quality compared to other handsets, but the screen is perfectly good.. Specifications are pretty impressive for a handset at this price point. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and Adreno 530 GPU are supported by a very generous 6GB of RAM. There's 64GB of internal storage, of which 52.7GB was free out of the box on my review sample. Nestled on the right edge is a caddy for two Nano SIMs, but OnePlus has not followed the current trend to double one of these up to accommodate MicroSD storage expansion. Wi-fi (802.11ac), Bluetooth (4.2) and NFC are built in.. The OnePlus 3's main 16-megapixel camera features electronic and optical image stabilisation, HDR and RAW support and 'dynamic de-noise' technology.. There's a 16-megapixel main camera and an 8-megapixel front camera. There are plenty of camera features, and it is easy to work with them. For example, there are simple touch toggles for flash, HDR and HD quality, and slider wheels for white balance, ISO, shutter speed and focus. These allow for adjustments to be made quickly photo by photo. A swipe on the screen toggles stills and video modes, and a further menu gives easy access to time-lapse, slow-motion and panorama shooting. Meanwhile, the front camera can be set to take a photo automatically when its subject is smiling. This isn't always ideal as only one person in a group needs to smile for the shot to be taken. The old-fashioned method of manual image capture might be better for group selfies.. Android 6 is integrated with OxygenOS , but the overlay is not riddled with oodles of apps and extras, as some handset customisations are. Instead, the additions are about usability, and they're quite understated. Consequently the user experience is very close to that of stock Android, but beefed up with extra features.. For example, a sweep left on the home screen takes the user to Shelf, an area where various widgets, notes (with or without alarm reminders) and frequently-used contacts and apps can be stored for easy access. The list scrolls vertically as it grows.. Other nice features include the ability to swap the order of recent and back buttons in hardware, set the screen to 'dark mode' to help save battery power, and even customise LED notification colours.. My favourite tweaks are gesture based, and all can be configured individually. When the screen is off you can get a brief peek at the current time by waving across the front camera; a double tap can be used to wake the handset up; a drawn 'O' starts the camera, while a 'V' toggles the flashlight; pulling two fingers down the screen starts music; and drawing '<' or '>' with a fingertip controls playback.. The mix of hardware design, features, performance and Oxygen OS extras is very well balanced in the OnePlus 3, and the result is an excellent all-rounder with some very attractive capabilities. Anyone looking for a new handset off-contract should consider it. The OnePlus 3 is quite simply the best handset in its price range right now.. Kick off your day with ZDNet's daily email newsletter.

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Many, if not most, of us. It's human nature: we like pretty things. That definitely applies to gadgets, to a point where we. put too much attention into how it. looks instead of how it works. But at the end of the day a gadget’s looks doesn’t matter one lick if it’s not functional.. This is why I’m baffled at the universal praise the Samsung Galaxy S7 has gotten, despite Samsung’s awkward placement of the back button that’s against human cognitive logic. This is why I wonder about reviewers who don’t dock points from the. 10 for making phones that forces you to drag your finger all the way to the top of the screen to bring the notification shade down when it’s obvious phones today have gotten too large for that action to be done in a comfortable manner. This is why I wonder how phones that don’t give you the option to double tap to wake/lock can still go unpunished by reviewers.. These things are crucial to basic functionality of a phone. humans cannot pull down a notification shade from a HTC 10 with one hand unless they contort their hands. press a button to wake a device display. takes more time and attention than double tapping a screen – these. And so when a phone like the OnePlus 3 comes along that gives you a myriad of options for. customization, I want to stand up and applaud. I want to gush to everyone around me how much of a joy it is to use this phone. I want to let people know that if you care about functionality and ease-of-use, the OnePlus 3 is the best phone on the market right now. (Yes, I am aware I just wrote a piece praising LG's mobile UI for being most functional, but OnePlus has topped it). OnePlus 3 is a very clean looking phone. the OnePlus 3 next to the Huawei P9 Plus. Both phones are very similar in size.. describe OnePlus 3's software, OxygenOS: it looks and feels like stock Android, but with very useful, very cool Nova launcher-like customization features added. For example, the OnePlus 3 lets you reconfigure its three main hardware buttons in various ways. The back button is set to the left of home button/fingerprint sensor by default (where it should be), but if you've been brainwashed by Samsung into preferring it on the right side, the OnePlus 3 lets you do that.. I've set my device so that whenever I double tap the home button, the screen turns off. You can set it so a double tap of the same button would launch the camera. On my phone, long pressing the back button brings up the last. app I used (this is great for quick jumping back and forth between apps), if you want, you can change it so long pressing. These are very useful features that shaves a second off. The HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 also have hard buttons, yet both companies don't offer any type of customization options -- the buttons are locked into one function and that's that. Some HTC 10 owners took issue with my review of that phone, arguing that they don't need "customization options," but really, who in their right mind wouldn't want more functionality options?. OxygenOS's menu offers in-depth customization options.
