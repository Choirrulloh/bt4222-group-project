Based on my criteria, the salesperson in Carphone Warehouse should have given me the Nokia 3310. I only need a phone temporarily while I'm without my iPhone for 2-3 weeks. I was shown either a £100 Huawei and, when I asked for something cheaper, I was given this without even being shown any alternatives. Rather than making me nostalgic for the 3210 of my teens, it's left me incredibly frustrated at having to do the smallest task such as sending a text. Not happy with the service or the phone!. Rated 5 out of. I love this phone fits in my pocket perfectly can talk and text battery life is great nice little phone to carry with you. Rated 5 out of. I am amazed by how good this phone is.

Nokia 105 (2017) - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ». Battery performance is not so good. I expected far better battery performance from nokia. Same range Chinese feature phone may be better than this.. I recently bought a Nokia 105 (2017). It came with a BL-5CB 800mAh battery and a mains charger. An elderly relative of mine has an old Nokia 1200 which uses a BL-5CA 700mAh battery but that Nokia 1200 no longer charges its BL-5CA battery although the battery still works. I have tried the BL-5CA in my new Nokia 105 (2017) and it fits and the phone works. I tried plugging in the Nokia 105 charger for a few seconds and it seems to charge the BL-5CA. I just want to know if the BL-5CA battery can be SAFELY charged in the Nokia 105 (2017). If it can, then I could buy another Nokia 105 for my elderly relative and that would enable him to continue using his old Nokia 1200 by charging its BL-5CA battery in the new Nokia 105 (2017), as well as being able to use the new phone too. However, I don't want to advise him to charge the BL-5CA battery in the Nokia 105 unless I have a bit more assurance that the difference in chargers would not cause the BL-5CA to explode or catch fire. Bare essentials phone for working in tough environments when you can not continuously stress about your 'in the way' smartphone that might and probably will get damaged. Very few cost effective options remain for people who gets their hands dirty for work. Makes me sick to think what the world would be like if everything is focused on the fancy top elite folk who can nurse a smartphone 24/7 with little consideration for the bare essentials that keeps the actual wheels rolling. Clouds and virtual etc will blow over and crash but the rest of the 'lower level idiots' has to keep on serving the actual evil idiots about to ruin the planet.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty Good Phone If All You Want Is A Phone. This is not what I would even call a feature phone. This is a dumbphone, sometimes in every sense of the word. My 4 star rating is not to be compared to the best phone in the world, but to other "feature" or "dumb" phones. People purchasing this should be expecting to only receive phone calls and text messages (TEXT MESSAGES, NOT GIFS, IMAGES, ETC.) There is no browser, no camera, no bluetooth, no SD card expansion, no mp3 player (there is radio if headphones are connected). This phone works on GSM networks: so only T-Mobile, or one of the MVNOs that use their towers. This phone only supports 2G and there is some concern as to how much longer carriers will support it. AT&T stopped their 2G services at the beginning of 2017. For being a phone...it does pretty well. You can save contacts to either the phone or the sim card. The contacts are presented as an alphabetical list. Using T-mobile towers (US Mobile to be exact) the phone quality is ok. Remember that this isn't capable of using HD Voice or compatible technology as that requires LTE. For text messaging....this is where is lacks. While I'm comfortable with using a numpad for typing texts, it requires too many extra key presses just to send a message. Example: you receive a text, you go through the menu to text messages, click to read text...there is no reply button. Instead you have to click Opt, then reply, then type reply, and then when you want to send...it asks you to confirm the number you are sending the message to. A small thing but instead of 2 clicks it is 5....for every reply....think about that. All in all I like the phone as it gets the job done with minimal cost and distraction. It can be good to do a detox from your smartphone, good as a backup phone for emergencies (30 day stand-by with 15 hour talk time!), good as a first phone for young kids, etc. I would say this is NOT a good phone for seniors unless they have decent vision, finger dexterity, and are pretty good with technology already. This is a small phone (a plus in my opinion) with small buttons and somewhat small font on a 1.8" screen.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars This phone works on Ting.. This phone works great on Ting, which is what I bought it for. It has text messaging and three games included. There's no camera or web browser, which is fine by me. The phone calls sound loud and I haven't received any complaints about how I sound.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars a handfull of nostalgia. i don't know how nokia manages to make rubber in such a way that it feels worn in from the moment you pull their phones out of the package, but other than not having bubble buttons it feels like a lighter version of the phone i had in high school. coverage is pants in my area, but thats not the phones fault, and i knew that before i bought it. this phone will only operate on 2g GSM networks, and that basically means T-Mobile and it's prepaid subsidiaries if you're in the US. abroad this may be a different story, but as many people have already mentioned, this tech is on its way out and it would have been nice to see 3g support on a 2017 device. that said, this probably has a lot to do with the exceptionally low price point.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Abysmal call quality. It’s a cheap phone with bare minimum functionality - which was exactly what I was looking for to use on T-Mobile in Los Angeles as a way to detox from smartphone use. However, the phone was unable to maintain phone calls, which is a deal breaker, especially during any type of emergency. Calls are constantly dropped and with unrelenting static from both ends. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great as a house phone.. Purchased this phone to use as a house phone. The month long stand by time and 12 hour talk time are impressive features. It's very small, but if you lose it you can always call it with another phone to find it.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Not unlocked. I put 3 popular service providers sim cards and none of them will work. The call failed or msg failed. Do not buy phone is not unlocked to any service provider.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Four Stars. It's a $20 burner; you get what you pay for.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Bad product.. It didnt work, hard to return for the price. Was this review helpful to you?. It doesn't work with my two different SIM card , bad phone. 1.0 out of 5 stars bad phone. The mobile is not working, there is no service ! I tried to use it in the US and in kuwait, but the same issue, no service, and i don’t know how to get my money back again. 1.0 out of 5 stars Not working mobile. Phone does not work with h2o Mobile.
