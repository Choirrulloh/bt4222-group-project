Camera has got many modes which allow good photo even with 5 MP. Not that good, but not bad. Good battery backup because the lack of IPS. I don't think it's a big problem. Phone offers very good music experience. Has got a bass booster and surrounding sound that are accessed by clicking the three lines on the right side when playing song. Overall I have it and I'm happy with it. The phone is good and I really liked the music functions. I think that with one Dolby it would be one good music smartphone :). Love Lenovo...good device equal to the price.. Its very slow and hang so many times ...also baterry backup is very poor ...These all problems occur within 6 months ...One of the Faltu smartphone ever i seen. Szafz, 03 Oct 2017 Everything is good. But Kannada language is not supporting in this mobile does not support ilocano dialect :(. How to set it up right? Don`t put heavy apps is first. FB Lite is a great app and will free your device to full speed instead of standart facebook. Use Via browser or Opera instead. Reading mode apps for saving battery on night and eyes health as a bonus. Don`t use a case if you don`t want overheat. Use Clean Master and DU Booster for speed up too.

When price matters Source: Laptop Media Vibe C offers a convenient design thanks to its 5-inch display and slightly curved sides. Additionally, you are presented with a good performance for this range provided by Qualcomm Snapdragon 210. Even when it comes to software, the model performs at more than a reasonable level, offering a UI with useful additional pre-installed apps. Just like almost every budget smartphone, Vibe C has its drawbacks. They are chiefly manifested in its display, as it lacks an IPS panel, although we can perhaps overlook this since the customers that will be using this device will not really need an IPS screen. The battery life is another disadvantage. Of course, it depends on how you are planning to use the device but donât expect good durability.

LaptopMedia.com Reviews Lenovo Vibe C quick review - when price matters. From: LaptopMedia Team 10 September 2016 / 13:38. If it weren’t for the ads, LaptopMedia wouldn’t be running. Our articles are free to read but the equipment in our Labs isn’t. We want to be as objective and unbiased as possible, and you can help us keep our jobs by whitelisting our media in your adblocker.. Lenovo is really diligent in trying to become the leader of the low-end and mid-range smartphone market, and for this reason they announce many new models within a short period of time, giving consumers a wider set of options. And if our reviews of Lenovo smartphones typically deal with mid-range and premium offers, this time we would like to show you what a budget model is capable of. Its specs sheet may not be that impressive but this is why it’s one of the most affordable Lenovo smartphones on the market. If you are into more premium devices, then perhaps this is where you should stop reading. However, if you are after a more modest product which is easy on your pocket, then Vibe C can appeal to you.. If you are interested in this model, you can check its price and availability here:. Design and construction Display Sound Specs sheet Battery Software Performance Temperatures Camera Verdict. Vibe C has a classic design that will not impress you with anything revolutionary but it is simplified and neat, which is a plus. As expected, the construction is plastic and we are slightly disappointed by the matte back which seems to retain fingerprints. Perhaps the white version is a better choice when it comes to this. On this back side you can find the loudspeaker, placed near the bottom, and a Lenovo inscription in the middle, as well as the 5MP main camera along with its LED flash.. Also noticeable are the slightly chamfered edges of the back panel, which should ensure a more comfortable grip and will create the feeling for a thinner profile, whose actual thickness is the reasonable 9 mm. This is more than enough for the available volume controls and Power button on the right side of the phone. Furthermore, they are easily distinguishable thanks to their silverish color. They are also slightly protruding and provide the necessary convenience when working. On the left you won’t find anything, while the top holds the headphones jack and microUSB charging port. The bottom only has the main integrated mic.. An indicative feature of Vibe C’s front is the thicker screen bezels but this is quite common in the budget range. Other than that, we have the three classic Android capacitive buttons, which do not have an LED backlighting. Above the screen, there is only a front-facing camera and earpiece without any other sensors (such as proximity and ambient light sensors). This means that you will have to manually adjust screen brightness.. The back panel is easily removable thanks to a small notch in the lower corner. Once it’s out of the way, the battery can be easily taken out, too. You will also be presented with all available slots – one for a standard SIM card, one microSIM card slot, and a dedicated microSD card slot.. Vibe C features a 5-inch display which ensures enough working space and comfortable grip when holding the phone in a single hand. 854 х 480 p, which translates into 196 ppi. We can probably say that this detailness is standard for the price range but it would have been better if we had an HD display. And if this is negligible, the lack of an IPS panel is not. The colors are not so contrasty and vivid, and viewing angles are not the best. Additionally, the display settings menu only has some standard settings such as brightness adjustments, wallpaper changes, font size and others.. The sound output is average but we didn’t expect anything more in this respect. Still, it’s good that there are no deviations to be noticed.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 (4-core, 1.10GHz, Cortex-A7). 5-inch TFT display (854 x 480. Bluetooth v4.0, A2DP, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, GPS, A-GPS. 5-MP with autofocus and an LED flash (rear), 2MP (front). microSD card slot (supports up to 32GB). Vibe C comes with a 2300 mAh battery. This may not sound a lot but the energy consumption is not great either. Of course, we tested this battery unit in five different tests – a. phone call, Wi-Fi and 3G Web browsing, video playback and 3D gaming. The settings we used were the usual – screen brightness of 120 cd/m2, Wi-Fi module turned on, 3G turned off (with the exception of the 3G Web browsing test), Bluetooth and GPS turned off. As far as the battery menu goes, it gives info about its charge and usage but offers no power saving modes.. Talk Time Web Surfing - Wi-Fi Web Surfing - 3G Video Playback 3D Gaming. In this test the screen doesn’t affect the battery life, since the proximity sensor turns it off during phone calls.

Android 5.1 with Lenovo’s custom UI on top, which changes the layout of icons and menus. Just like most Lenovo devices, there is no app drawer to be found here, and all apps are placed on the home screen. This trend is found in other companies such as Apple, Huawei, etc. To avoid untidiness on your home screen, you can sort apps in folders as some of the pre-installed apps have been arranged. Additionally, the drop-down menu has been changed, too, and it now features additional options such as quick activation of Super Power or Do Not Disturb modes. Also available is another menu, activated by swiping from bottom to top. It offers shortcuts to various settings, as well as options to change your theme or wallpaper.. Along with the standard Google set of apps, you are provided with many other apps that do not come with stock Android. These include SHAREit for data transfer between devices and SYNCit for synchronization with a cloud service or a microSD card. McAfee Security guards you from various malware types (be it threats coming from apps, websites or other). You will also find Evernote for notetaking, an optimized UC Browser in case you are not happy with the available Google Chrome, WPS Office for reading and editing of various documents, as well as a flashlight and file manager. A good deal of these apps has been arranged in separate folders. For example, the “Social” folder includes Facebook, Twitter, and Skype. There is also a “Tools” folder which contains a calculator, compass, FM radio and others.. Lenovo Companion is an app that allows diagnostics of your smartphone’s components,. solutions to FAQs, informational videos, and updates.. In comparison to other Lenovo models, the Theme center app here does not offer many options. Nonetheless, you still have six different themes that completely alter the layout of menus and icons.. In the settings menu you will find a “Buttons” submenu which can increase the functionality of the available hardware buttons. For example, the Power button can be used to end a call, and the volume controls could wake your device.. You are also provided with an “Accessibility” submenu that includes options for ease of use, chiefly meant for people with health problems.. Vibe C uses the 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 mobile CPU, which has four Cortex-A7 cores. This is a 32-bit mobile chip, manufactured through a 28nm technological process, and it’s meant chiefly for low-end devices. It also supports Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.1, and LTE Cat. 4, which can ensure download speeds of up to 150Mbps and upload speeds of up to 50Mbps. Additionally, it supports displays with up to HD res, and up to 8MP cameras and HD video recording. Quick Charge 2.0 Qualcomm technology for quick battery charging. The mobile chip also comes with the Adreno 304 GPU, and the RAM capacity is 1 GB. You can read more about Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 on Qualcomm’s official web page:. The internal storage on this device is 8 GB, 3.7 GB of which are occupied by system files. Around 1 GB is dedicated to pre-installed apps, so you are left with 3.5 GB. Nonetheless, there is a microSD card slot through which you can expand.. Geekbench 3.0 (Multi-Core) Vellamo 3 Metal Vellamo 2 Metal.

After the performance test, it’s time to see whether there will be an increase of exterior temperatures after a continuous workload. Once again, we make use of the Epic Citadel app thanks to which we simulate 3D gaming for several hours. Immediately after that, we make measurements at three different sections of the smartphone’s back and note only the maximum values. The hottest point we registered proved in the camera – 45.6 degrees Celsius. This is a value that is slightly above our understanding of what’s normal but considering the fact that it’s a maximum value after a serious stress test, we can let it pass. The mid section displayed a max temp of 44.5 degrees, and the lowest section – 40.1 degrees.. The main camera is 5MP and it has autofocus and LED flash. Lenovo has included many options in terms of modes, and apart from auto, you get Panorama and several effects that can change the photo colors. You will also find all the standard manual settings such as Scenes, ISO, exposure comp, white balance, etc. Additionally, you can record HD videos.. Lenovo Vibe C is not the best choice if you want to change your current smartphone. However, it can be recommended as a first time smartphone or as an affordable backup model for work. At the end of the day, you get what you pay for and you should ask yourselves what can you sacrifice for the sake of lower price.. Vibe C offers a convenient design thanks to its 5-inch display and slightly curved sides. Additionally, you are presented with a good performance for this range provided by. Even when it comes to software, the model performs at more than a reasonable level, offering a UI with useful additional pre-installed apps. Just like almost every budget smartphone, Vibe C has its drawbacks. They are chiefly manifested in its display, as it lacks an IPS panel, although we can perhaps overlook this since the customers that will be using this device will not really need an IPS screen. The battery life is another disadvantage. Of course, it depends on how you are planning to use the device but don’t expect good durability.. If you are interested in this model, you can check its price and availability here:. Convenient design with easy access to the battery and two SIM card slots. UI with additional apps and features.
