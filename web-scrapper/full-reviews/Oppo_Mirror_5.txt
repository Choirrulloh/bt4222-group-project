It has a huge storage capacity and can store many movies and you can interchange the storage if your internal storage is full. The camera is good (front and back) no need for filter!. Battery - it is normal that the you charge it 2-3 times a day depending on your usage.. Network Connectivity - No hazzle in connection network internet as long as you set your phone into 3G/ LTE..

The OPPO Mirror 5 features 5-inch qHD display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 SOC with 2GB of RAM and 16 gigs of expandable internal memory. There is 8-megapixels camera on the back, as well as 5-megapixels selfie unit. The Mirror 5 is powered by 2420 mAh battery and runs Android 5.1.. OS: Android (5.1), OPPO ColorOS UI. Dimensions: 5.65 x 2.80 x 0.30 inches (143.4 x 71.2 x 7.65 mm). Weight: 5.64 oz (160 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 540 x 960 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Night mode, Effects. Features: Time-lapse video, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Quad-core, 1200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20.

Features: Mass storage device, USB Host, USB charging. Other: Infrared, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

The first thing that draws attention toward Oppo Mirror 5 is its nice, colorful mirrored design of the back panel. The sleek, slim and elegant design of Mirror 5 is one of its specialty. It also comes with some pretty interesting features in a good reasonable price.. 2 GB RAM and 16 GB ROM are two big advantages of Mirror 5, combined with 1.2 GHz quad-core CPU, 3G+4G network and adreno 306 GPU. This altogether means that, multitasking should not be any issue, 3D gaming should be okay, internet browsing should be smooth and fast, more than enough storage for install all your favorite games and apps as well as store photos/videos/docs and user interface may respond very quick. But note that, you should not expect to play all the top quality 3D games with this device as for that you may need a 3 GB RAM and high adreno GPU version e.g. Camera is decent and satisfactory but it could be a little better for the price. It is offering 8 MP primary and 5 MP front camera. The primary cam has HDR, flash, different scene modes etc. However, a 13 MP camera with autofocus could make the camera more competitive to other brand phones in this price range. Some other pros of Mirror 5 are dual SIM, android lollipop OS, Full HD video, OTG, decent battery backup etc.. User Rating: 3.04 ( 110 votes). Oppo Mirror 5 Rating by MobileDokan.

Kể từ lần ra mắt đầu tiên, OPPO Mirror 5 hiện vẫn đang “làm mưa làm gió” ở thị phần smartphone tầm trung tại thị trường Việt Nam, vậy điều gì đã tạo nên sức hút cho máy?. Thiết kế mặt lưng lấp lánh tựa kim cương. Phần mặt lưng OPPO Mirror 5 với những họa tiết lấp lánh tựa kim cương, với mỗi góc nhìn khác nhau sẽ cho những hiệu ứng ánh sáng đẹp mắt.. Hơi thất vọng khi OPPO Mirror 5 chỉ được trang bị màn hình độ phân giải qHD (540 x 960 pixel), với màn hình 5 inch sử dụng tấm nền IPS LCD cho góc nhìn rộng, màu sắc chấp nhận được.. Chất lượng hiển thị mức khá. Camera tốt, hỗ trợ nhiều tính năng theo kèm. Đầu tiên phải nói đến camera trước độ phân giải 5 MP với công nghệ Beautify 3.0 giúp bạn có những bức ảnh selfie đẹp sau mỗi lần bấm máy.. Góc chụp rộng trên máy cho bạn thu được nhiều cảnh vật xung quanh hơn. Ảnh được làm mịn đẹp mắt nhưng không quá ảo, tuy màu sắc không thực sự tươi tắn. Camera sau 8 MP khẩu độ f/2.2 cho khả năng chụp ảnh thiếu sáng tốt cùng thời gian phơi sáng nhanh hơn giúp giảm hiện tượng nhòe.. Cùng với đó là hàng loạt tính năng như Time-lapse, Panorama, HDR, Super GIF... giúp bạn dễ dàng trở thành nhiếp ảnh chuyên nghiệp.. Độ chi tiết của ảnh được đánh giá ở mức khá khi zoom 100% (Ảnh: Lê Minh Ty ). Phơi sáng 4 giây, EV -2, cân bằng trắng đèn huỳnh quang trên chế độ chuyên gia của máy ( Ảnh: Lê Minh Ty). Bạn có thể xem thêm phần đánh giá camera tại đây .. Cấu hình phần cứng tốt so với tầm giá. Với vi xử lý Snapdragon 410 , chip đồ họa Adreno 306 , RAM 2 GB và bộ nhớ trong 16 GB đủ sức chạy mượt mà các ứng dụng hay game phổ biến hiện nay.. Máy chạy được game nặng khá nhưng đồ họa hiển thị chỉ ở mức giá. Hỗ trợ người dùng tối đa. Ở chế độ màn hình đang tắt bạn cũng dễ dàng sử dụng cử chỉ để mở các ứng dụng, tính năng thu gọn màn hình giúp thao tác một tay dễ dàng hơn hay tính năng Smart Remote Control giúp bạn dễ dàng điều khiển các thiết bị gia dụng trong nhà.. OPPO Mirror 5 là sự kết hợp hài hòa giữa thiết kế bắt mắt, cấu hình phần cứng ổn định, chất lượng camera tốt xứng đáng là lựa chọn ở phân khúc dưới 5 triệu đồng..

OPPO Mirror 5 review A beautiful design isn't enough to hide some glaring flaws. by Bailey Stein August 24, 2015. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The OPPO Mirror 5 is a great-looking smartphone with some positives, but the low resolution display and slightly lower-end processing package are concerns given the price point of the device.. 960 x 540 resolution, 220 ppi. Processor 1.2 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor. Camera 8 MP rear camera with LED flash. Software Color OS v2.1, based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Dimensions 143.4 x 71.2 x 7.7 mm. OPPO has some fantastic smartphones on offer that feature something unique in terms of design and capabilities, including one of the thinnest smartphones of the world, or a flagship smartphone with a rotating camera setup that is still very distinctive and individual to OPPO. OPPO continues to add to its diverse portfolio that covers all levels of the price spectrum, including this new device that falls somewhere between the entry-level and mid-range.. What does this latest affordable smartphone from OPPO have to offer? We find out, in this full review of the OPPO Mirror 5!. If there is one area in which the Mirror 5 really shines, it is in terms of design, and shine it does, quite literally in fact. With individual cut-glass sections on the back cover, the Mirror 5 features a reflective facet design that is seeing some popularity among OEMs. OPPO themselves have used this design element before, and it is quite understandable if you do end up mistaking the Mirror 5 for another mid-range offering from the company, the OPPO R1x. The bi-metallic frame is a nice touch as well, and gives this device a very elegant look. One drawback with the plastic rear cover and the glass panel up front is that both surfaces are quite prone to fingerprints, and it is difficult to keep the device clean from smudges.. Going around the device, the power button and volume rocker can be found to the right and left respectively, placed to be within easy reach, and all the buttons offer a good amount of tactile feedback. The microUSB port is at the bottom, and up top is the headphone jack and an IR blaster. On the back is the primary camera at the top left corner, and on the same side, towards the bottom, is the single speaker unit. Even though the battery is not user-replaceable, the back cover is removable, giving you access to the dual SIM card slots and the microSD card slot. Up front, there is a notification LED above the display to the right, and below the display are the three capacitive back, home, and recent apps keys.. With a thickness of 7.7 mm and weighing 160 grams, the Mirror 5 feels substantial and solid in the hand, and given its relatively compact size when compared to the general trend in the Android world, the handling experience with the device is excellent, and one-handed use is very comfortable.. The OPPO Mirror 5 comes with a 5-inch IPS LCD display with a 960 x 540 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 220 ppi. Everything looks a little bit blurry, and text is understandably not as sharp as you would expect. While the quality of the display itself is just about average, the resolution is shockingly low, and very surprising, when considering the fact that some devices that fall in the price range of the Mirror 5 even feature Full HD screens. There is also no display protection like Gorilla Gorilla Glass, but OPPO does include a screen protector in the box.. Under the hood, the OPPO Mirror 5 packs a quad-core 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor, clocked at 1.2 GHz, and backed by the Adreno 306 GPU and 2 GB of RAM. This is a relatively low-end processing package, but other than applications requiring just a few seconds more to load, the day-to-day performance of the device is quite impressive. Multi-tasking is smooth, and the device handles gaming very well, with the low resolution display meaning that you wonât be seeing a lot of frame drops.. The Mirror 5 comes with 16 GB of on-board storage, which is further expandable via microSD card by up to 128 GB. Apart from a standard suite of connectivity options, the device also comes with dual SIM capabilities and 4G LTE support, but itâll be a good idea to check for compatibility with your local network carrier first.. There is a single speaker on the back, that does sound pretty good, with their being a little bit of distortion at the highest volumes though. As as is the case with any speaker placed on the back, the sound gets muffled when the device is placed on a flat surface.. As far as the battery life is concerned, the 2,420 mAh non-removable unit of the Mirror 5 allows for decent battery life, but it isnât exceptional. The device lasted for slightly longer than 12 hours with just over 3 hours of screen-on time, with average use. Power users may struggle to get a full day of use out of the battery, but there are a couple of power saving modes built-in to help you get that little bit of extra juice out of this battery.. The OPPO Mirror 5 comes with a 8 MP rear camera with an LED flash, and a 5 MP front-facing unit. The primary camera allows for some good looking shots, and as expected, the camera performs best in well-lit environments. As far as the camera app is concerned, the interface looks to have been inspired by the camera app from iOS, and includes a lot of shooting modes. There isnât a lot by way of manual control however, but a nice addition is a slider next to focus point on the viewfinder that lets you adjust the exposure quickly if needed.. On the software side of things, the OPPO Mirror 5 runs Color OS 2.1, based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Youâll be hard pressed to find a lot of Material Design elements in this user interface, with everything, including the settings menu, the recent apps screen, and the lock screen being different from the stock Android experience.. Thatâs not to say that OPPOâs take on Android is disappointing however, with it featuring some nice animations, and a slew of customization options. Granted, there is no app drawer, which leaves users dependent on folders to keep things organized, but that is expected and seen with a lot of Chinese smartphones. Perhaps the best part of the latest Color OS iteration is the various gestures it has baked in, including double tap to wake, drawing preset letters to directly open certain applications, and screen-on gestures like pinch to open the camera app, a swipe with two fingers to adjust the volume, and a swipe with three fingers to take a screenshot. There is also a one-handed mode, but apart from the gesture to activate it being somewhat jarring, it isnât really a necessary feature for this 5-inch display.. The OPPO Mirror 5 will be priced at around $245 in markets where it is officially available, with color options being white and blue.. So there you have it for this in-depth look at the OPPO Mirror 5! The device is not without its strong points, especially when it comes to the design, and the software experience. The display resolution is surprisingly low however, and the lower than mid-range processing package makes it hard to justify the price point, even if it still falls in the realm of affordability. A little more will get you arguably superior options, like the ASUS Zenfone 2 , and comparatively cheaper devices like the Meizu M2 Note and the Lenovo K3 Note seem to bring more to table as well..

Oppo’s Mirror 5 sports a fancy reflective back cover and a special camera. about Oppo’s successor to this year’s. Mirror 3 smartphone, the company officially introduced. the Mirror 5, which introduces stand-out design in a midrange package.. As previously alluded to, what separate the Mirror 5 from the rest of the herd is its strangely designed rear panel. According to Oppo, the back was designed with individual cut-glass sections, as well as different reflective tendencies, giving it the appearance of a diamond pattern. Not to be forgotten, the phone is kept together by a bimetallic frame.. in a world where most Android smartphones. aren’t that different from each other when it comes to looks, it’s refreshing to see Oppo’s take on things.. Unfortunately, the rest of the package doesn’t seem to stand out that much, with the Mirror 5 powered by a 64-bit quad-core 1.2GHz. Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor coupled with 2GB of RAM. The 5-inch, 960 x 540 TFT display should prove to be adequate,. nothing more or less, while the 16GB of internal storage can be expanded through the. inclusion of a MicroSD card slot.. Around back is an 8-megapixel camera with f/2.2 aperture, while a 5-megapixel camera will fulfill your selfie needs. The 2,420mAh battery should keep the lights on all day, and you’ll be interacting with. ColorOS 2.1, Oppo’s own flavor of Android 5.1 Lollipop.. Oppo didn’t reveal pricing information for the Mirror 5, though the phone will launch in White and Blue in 15 international markets, including Mexico,. the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Asia.. if you’re interested in the Mirror 5, your best bet is to import one.. Having just released the decidedly midrange Mirror 3 back in January, one would think Oppo wouldn’t announce its successor for a while. Fast forward to today, a mere five. months later, and Oppo has already started work on the Mirror 5, reports GSMArena .. The Mirror 5 separates itself from the pack with a mirrored back cover, resulting in a finish. that looks classy without being ostentatious. The back panel does look reminiscent of the R1C ‘s, since they both feature a diamond pattern on the back.. deliver as beefy specifications as the R7 and R7 Plus , which were announced in May, but the Mirror 5 does feature a rear camera with Oppo’s Pure Image 2.0+ algorithm. According to Oppo, Pure Image 2.0+ introduces a variety of camera features, such as auto panorama, double exposure, and “after focus,” which will likely. let you focus on other subjects after taking a picture.. In addition to the camera software, the Mirror 5 will also reportedly feature a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. Powering the smartphone is an unknown processor paired with 2GB of RAM. The Mirror 3 didn’t include very powerful hardware, either, so we’re expecting the same of the Mirror 5.. 16GB of internal storage, but because it seems like paltry storage for a smartphone that will seemingly emphasize its camera features, the Mirror 5 could. include a MicroSD card slot for memory expansion. Finally, the Mirror 5 will run Android Lollipop out of the box.. According to the report, Oppo will. launch the Mirror 5 in 20 markets by the end of June or beginning of July.. There will be 3G and LTE versions of the phone, and Taiwan will be the first to receive the Mirror 5. The report didn’t mention whether the phone will make its way to the West, though much like previous Oppo phones, that’s an unlikely scenario.. 4 cameras and a mirror-like finish make the midrange Honor 9 Lite stand out.
