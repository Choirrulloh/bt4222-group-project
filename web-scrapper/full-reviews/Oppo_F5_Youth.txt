By Pooja M | 12 Dec 2017. Oppo service center is yet workin on it. Browser problem has not been resolved everytime the settings changes on its own. Again service center employees say we are working on it. If we tell them gv me a phone that works and change this handset they say it is possible if u leave ur phone for 24hrs with us. Hence ull be without a device till then n its none of their concern. Worst aftersales service I've received from any company. Been running around at the service center two times and 3times at the place of sale. But they just make u run around here n there. Nobody's bothered once sale is closed.. Was this review helpful?

The previously released Oppo F5 has got fine response from the market because of its performance profile, camera features and reasonable pricing. Oppo F5 Youth is coming with a little lower price with few compromises in the camera features and performance. But for the price, it can still be considered a fine choice. First of all, the design is up-to-date, modern and fabulous with a stunning 6-inch Full HD+ display. Using a phone is much more comforting with a 6-inch display especially or watching videos, chatting, using social media, browsing around or playing games. But definitely, display size and quality is not enough for performing all these tasks. With a 3 GB RAM, a great octa-core 2.5 GHz CPU and classy Helio P23 from Mediatek, you can't go wrong at all. Camera quality is slightly lower than the F5 but is still quite worth for the price. Especially, the 16 MP front camera is the highlight for Oppo F5 Youth. Face unlock, fingerprint, artificial intelligence (AI) beautify for the camera, navigation gesture and 50 MP UHD video are some of its other interesting features.. User Rating: 3.43 ( 9 votes).

It packs 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of built-in storage which supports an expandable memory of up to 256 GB via microSD card. As for the platform, it runs on Android 7.1 Nougat with the company's in-house ColorOS 3.2 on top.. On the camera department, the F5 Youth features a 13-megapixel rear snapper with f/2.2 aperture and LED flash.

OPPO F5 vs OPPO F5 Youth Specs, Features, Price, and Design Comparison. Php 2,000 or $40 USD separate the OPPO F5 and OPPO F5 Youth here in the Philippines. The more expensive OPPO F5 midrange hero model was released here on October 26, 2017 with an official price tag of Php 15,990. On the other hand, the more wallet-friendly OPPO F5 Youth landed on our shores a month after - November 26, 2017 - donning an official suggested retail price of Php 13,990. If you're currently at wits' end trying to choose between the two, allow me to help you. On the outside, OPPO F5 and OPPO F5 Youth look large identical with the former just having one distinguishing design characteristic. In fact, the two have the exact same dimensions and weight. Both handsets have a polycarbonate back case with metallic finish and shiny accents that give them an air of elegance and opulence. The phones' faces are likewise largely similar; Each flaunting a tall 6-inch Full HD+ IPS all-screen panel with tall 18:9 aspect ratio and rounded sides. As you can see in the photos above, just from looking at their faces, it's hard to pick one model from the other. I mean, the two are practically one and the same when viewed from this angle. So how do you quickly tell them apart? Well, flip them over and look at the back part. Clearly more premium-looking, the OPPO F5 has thin, laser-etched lines on its either ends that - for me - makes it appear more interesting. These bands are also somehow reminiscent of the antenna lines of the Apple iPhone -- albeit not exactly having the same finish or function. In contrast, OPPO F5 Youth has a more flat or bare look when viewed fro the back; Not having these shiny lines. Key Specs and Main Selling Points. To make it easier for use to compare the technical specifications and key features of these two devices, I took the liberty of making this straight-forward, side-by-side comparison table.

Php 15,990 Official SRP in the Philippines:. Obviously, strictly in terms of specs, OPPO F5 trumps the OPPO F5 Youth. To be specific, the more expensive model has a higher resolution rear camera with wider aperture, more powerful front-cam for selfies, and more RAM. However, I should note that all other features are the same: The processor, on-board storage, battery size, connectivity options, ports, sensors -- plus their main selling points, namely, the 6-inch Full-Screen IPS display, which seems to be the trend this year and moving forward, as well as OPPO's AI Beautification Software , which delicately enhances self-portraits while keeping the integrity of the user's facial features via automatic recognition of his or her gender, race, and age. Another cool innovation that these two model share is Face Unlock. Previously available only on flagship level handset models, facial recognition is a secure and convenient to quickly unlock the phone's interface simply by looking at the front-facing camera. OPPO and Vivo are the first two companies to bring this technology to the midrange bracket. So which model is right for you?. As I've noted above, Php 2,000 separate these two phones. Now, it's up to you whether you want to spend that additional amount to get the better technical specifications that OPPO F5 has or not. If you just want to enjoy the Full Screen display and the Face Unlock as well take your selfie snapping experience to the next level with AI Beauty software -- and you're not really a power user who opens a lot of applications on your handset all at the same time, you might want to save the money and just go with OPPO F5 Youth. Personally, I prefer the OPPO F5 simply because I need that 4GB of RAM for smooth multitasking and the more powerful rear camera for taking good photos across various lighting conditions. Let me know your thoughts about these two popular OPPO midrange smartphones in the comments section below. TechPinas Smartphone Technical Specifications Comparison Table. OPPO F5 vs OPPO F5 Youth.

Jules Wang October 19, 2017 2:14 pm. The Selfie Master will come in three forms this year, according to a Thai promotional flyer for the OPPO F5 , F5 6GB and F5 Youth.. We already have a hint of many of the specs that the OPPO F5 6GB thanks to a retail webpage dump, but it looks like we have two other phones to deal with.. OPPOCLUB pulled a page showing them off.. The main difference between the F5 and F5 6GB will be in the RAM department — the former will have 4GB while the latter is just kind of self-explanatory, we guess. The OPPO F5 Youth, meanwhile, will differ from the other two with a single 16-megapixel selfie camera as opposed to dual 12-megapixel units.. All devices will have AI-enhanced beauty modes , facial recognition for authentication and 6-inch 2:1 displays at 1080p. We suspect that more differences will pop up on the internals, but nothing gets called out here other than the F5 6GB’s 64GB of storage.. Pre-orders in Thailand will come with a VIP card, an OPPO-branded bag and a special gift box. We should expect a launch event on October 26 ..
