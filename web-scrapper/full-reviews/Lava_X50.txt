Yesterday, my friend told me about Lava X50 and I decided to buy it instantly. The phone features 5.5-inch display that would give me a better user experience. I have a habit to use phone while dining, and I guess that its screen-shrink feature would help me to do both the things at a time. Along with this, its battery of 2800 mAh gives me assurance that I can spend my travel time without any worry. This was just an overview of the review!
