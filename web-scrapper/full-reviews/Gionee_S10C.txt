These are few first phones from Gionee to feature dual cameras on the back and the aesthetics seem to be inspired from the iPhone 7 Plus.. Gionee S10 is the most high-end phone among the three. The phone comes with ridiculous 4 cameras, two on the back and two on the front. It’s not the first time we’ve seen two front camera’s but altogether 4 cameras on a single phone are pretty insane. The primary cameras have 16MP/8MP sensors while the secondary cameras have 20MP/8MP sensors. S10 comes with a dedicated image processing hardware. This is the second phone launched this week to feature a 20MP camera, other is the Huawei Nova 2 .. The phone sports a 5.5inch Full HD display and comes with 2.5D glass for a seamless look. Powering the phone is the MediaTek Helio P25 Octa-core chipset clocked at 2.6Ghz coupled with 6GB of RAM. The phone packs 64GB onboard storage which can be expanded via MicroSD card. Backing up the S10 is a 3,450mAh battery.. Gionee S10B is a mid-ranger in the bunch. The phone also comes with 5.5inch Full HD display. The phone is powered by MediaTek’s P10 octa-core chipset clocked at 2.0 GHz coupled with 4GB of RAM. S10B also carries 64GB onboard storage with expandability option.. Optics wise, it comes with a dual 13MP/5MP combo on the back and a single 16MP shooter on the front. It is backed up by 3,700mAh battery.. Gionee S10C is the lower midrange in the bunch. The phone comes with a 5.2inch Full HD display. Opting out of MediaTek, this phone is powered by Snapdragon 427 Quad-Core chipset clocked at 1.4Ghz. S10C also comes equipped with 4GB of RAM.. This is the only phone which doesn’t feature a dual camera on the back. It is rocking a 13MP camera on the front and 16MP on the back. Backing up this device is a 3,100mAh battery.. All three S10’s come with a fingerprint sensor and runs on Android 7.0 Nougat with Amigo OS on top. The S10, S10B, and S10C will be priced $380, $320 and $233 respectively..
