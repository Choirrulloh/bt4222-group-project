The rear side of the device. 3 Nokia XL 2G. Further information: Nokia X family. The Nokia XL was announced in a surprising manner at the 2014 edition of Mobile World Congress on 24 February 2014 which was held in Barcelona, Spain. Reports suggested only a 4-inch touchscreen Android running Nokia X will be unveiled but Nokia also announced the 'Nokia X family' which was made up of Nokia X, Nokia X+ and Nokia XL.. Nokia XL was much of a hardware upgrade from the other members of the maiden Nokia X family. It came with a 5-inch touchscreen instead of the 4-inch ones on the others. It featured a bigger camera (5. MP sensor) and also a LED flash and 2. MP front-facing camera—the last two are absent on the Nokia X and Nokia X+ models. The phone was known in the development stages as "Asha Monster".

The Nokia XL is among the first wave of Android phones made by Nokia – a company whose strong ties to Windows Phone until now stopped it from making phones using Google’s OS.. It costs just 109 Euros – and likely the same amount in pounds. While not all that glitzy, it is one of the most interesting new mobiles we’ve seen at MWC 2014. I tried out the new phone to see whether Nokia has aced Android on its first attempt.. On first glance, you could be forgiven for thinking the Nokia XL is a Lumia phone. It’s colourful, it’s made of plastic and it looks a bit like the Lumia 625. However, Nokia’s Lumia phones run Windows Phone where the Nokia XL uses Android.. Nokia produces a bunch of low-cost Windows mobiles, the Lumia 520 being the most obvious success, but the new Nokia X and XL Androids are intended to be even cheaper options. You’re looking at around £100 for each – the XL is around £10 more than the smaller X.. The Nokia XL’s bodywork is just like a lower-end Lumia too. Its plastic cover pops off, but it does a pretty good impression of a unibody phone. Tap the back and you can tell it isn’t one, but the look is there.. The build and feel of the phone is better than most low-cost Androids, although we wouldn’t say it feels any fancier than the Motorola Moto G , our current favourite cheapo Android phone. The Nokia XL’s use of colour is much better, though. As well as the usual red, yellow, black and white Lumia shades, the phone also comes in a rather fetching orange – as seen here.. The side buttons are also colour-matched to the body. These are the kind of finishing touches that are often neglected in budget phones, and Nokia rightfully boasts that the X-series Android phones offer the same renowned Nokia quality as its other mobiles. The XL is also a dual-SIM phone – a feature that’s not hugely popular in the UK, but is appreciated in the emerging markets that are the key target of the Nokia XL.. You’ll also notice that the controls are quite different from Nokia’s Lumia phones. There’s no camera button here – you use the touchscreen instead – and there’s just one soft key rather than three. It acts as a home/back button.. The display, however, is typical of one of Nokia’s cheaper phones. It’s a 5-inch LCD screen that uses a reasonable IPS panel. You don’t get the sort of contrast seen in Nokia’s ClearBlack-branded phone screens, such as the Lumia 1020 ‘s, and blacks are slightly greyish. Basic image quality is OK, though..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. Resolution is the most significantly limiting factor. The Nokia has an 800 x 480 pixel display – the same as the Lumia 520, which is a full inch smaller. The pixel structure isn’t too obvious, so it’s not a complete disaster, but the low pixel density is immediately apparent. Nokia does seem to have put some effort into making text look a little soft, rather than pixellated, which is some consolation.. Nokia has a decent amount of control how the phone looks as it has a custom interface on top of Android. And it looks nothing like ‘normal’ Android. If anything, it looks more like Windows Phone.. The Nokia XL uses Live Tile-style widgets, and the homscreens/app menu structure of vanilla Android has been discarded. Instead, all your apps and all the core phone features appear as square tiles. Some can be expanded to offer additional information, just like the Live Tiles of a Lumia phone. It scrolls like a Windows Phone home screen too.. Flick right to left on this screen and you’re taken to the Fast Lane interface. This is a list of your most recently used apps and other recent activities, and is a way to compensate for the main home screen’s tendency to get a bit busy, cluttered or messy.. I expect Nokia’s Android interface will go through plenty of optimisation and tweaks over the next year. And there is some work to be done here, but it’s a good start. It’s a complete overhaul of Android, but it’s not the laggy mess that some custom Android interfaces are. The Nokia XL uses a relatively low-end combo of a dual-core 1GHz processor and 768MB of RAM, but performance is decent.. There are some serious limitations to Nokia’s approach to Android, though. There are none of the official Google apps most Android owners rely on, and no access to the Google Play app store. Leaving out these basics used to be pretty common in non-certified budget tablets, but it’s rare for them to be left out of phones.. There may be a cost consideration involved, but Nokia also talks up its desire to take “people to Microsoft’s cloud, not Google’s cloud” (Microsoft has acquired Nokia). The sorts of services Google offers are replaced with Nokia and Microsoft ones. Google Drive becomes Microsoft OneDrive, and so on.. Google Play is perhaps the biggest issue, though. You can install third-party app stores, sideloading is supported and there’s a Nokia app store. But there’s really no replacing the Google Play store. Expect app support to be a little limited compared with the real deal.. Unlike the Nokia X, the XL has a reasonable camera array. You get a 2-megapixel front camera and a 5-megapixel rear one with a flash. If it’s anything like the Lumia 520’s camera, it’ll be reasonable for Facebook style snaps, if not any use for more serious posterity papping. And, as you might guess, this is not a 4G phone.. Carrying over Nokia’s Lumia style build quality to a cheap Android phone sounds like a winning combo, and it is in some respects. However, the low screen resolution and lack of Google services mean it’s far from perfect.. Next, read our best phones round-up. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Victor H.. Nokia - Nokia + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction The 5-inch Nokia XL is the largest in Nokia’s family of affordable Android -running phones, but just like all the rest in the X series, you’d find it hard to recognize it as an Android phone. This is because of Android Nokia X - the company’s own custom version of the platform that brings a Windows Phone-inspired interface and comes without all core Google apps. The Nokia XL does not even have the Google Play Store - instead it comes with Nokia’s own app catalog that lacks even very popular apps like Spotify and Netflix. The Nokia XL also got quite a few things going on - the large and vivid display, a fairly well-optimized performance, dual-SIM connectivity, and it’s got both a 5-megapixel main camera and a secondary, front cam. Can all these pros outweigh the cons of a weird Android experience and limited number of apps? Let’s find out. In the box: User Manual Wall Charger with non-detachable USB cable Headset Design The Nokia XL deserves its name - it’s big and unwieldy, larger than most other 5-inch phones. You can tell just by its name that the Nokia XL is a large device. Knowing that it’s a 5-inch phone actually does not tell too much about the phone - it does not reveal the fact the bezels on it are huge (especially the side ones), and that it all comes in a pretty thick and bulky package. It is the 0.43” (10.9mm) thickness, however, that really contributes to a feeling of a rather unwieldy phone. Not only is it thick, it's also very heavy, measuring 6.7 ounces (190g), more than even most phablets. It is solidly put together, though, and does not screak when you hold it tightly. Design-wise, the XL follows Nokia’s signature design language with a plastic wrap-around shell. The back is made of matte plastic that feels very similar to the material used in the Moto G , maybe a bit softer, but also very prone to attract oily fingerprints. Up front, there is just one capacitive ‘back’ key, right below the display - an element that reminds of Asha feature phones. All physical keys are on the right side - the power/lock key in the middle, and the volume rocker above it, and while both are decidedly plastic, they are comfortably within reach of your thumb, and very clicky and easy to press. Display The 5-inch screen is not sharp, but it more than makes up for this with its great and vivid colors. Outdoors, though, it’s hard to read the screen. The big highlight of the Nokia XL and the reason it carries its (not so flattering in apparel design) name is the spacious 5-inch display. It’s not truly XL by today’s standards, but it’s still big for this class of affordable devices. The screen comes with a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels (WVGA), which works out to a pixel density of the very low 189ppi. This drawback is most obvious when you look at text, which looks pixelated, forcing you to zoom in to be able to read it. If you don’t obsess over pixels, though, the 5” display of the Nokia XL will definitely make you happy with its lively, vivid colors. It’s among the best screens on an affordable phone we’ve seen so far - it’s not too cold, it’s got deep blacks, and while it’s just a bit off in terms of color, it looks great. Using the display under the direct sunlight outdoors, however, is a bit problematic - the peak brightness of 358 nits is on the low side, and the high reflectivity of the screen will force you stare and shield the screen to make out what’s on it. Finally, while viewing angles are not terrible, they are not good either and color and luminance decrease noticeably when you tilt the screen a bit.. 5.57 x 3.06 x 0.43 inches. 141.4 x 77.7 x 10.9 mm. 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 inches. 129.9 x 65.9 x 11.6 mm. 5.1 x 2.63 x 0.36 inches. 129.5 x 66.7 x 9.2 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

Not to mention the warranty will be void if you do that on any Nokia X devices. Not to mention these devices have a cortex-A5 CPU, which is a very low spec, low speed CPU..

The X2 cost 135 dollars and has a smaller screen. and has front and rear cameras. these smart phones are made for selling to Folks who do not make as much money as Americans do who make minimum wage and these smart phones are for markets where the cell phone carriers do subsidize the price of a Persons smart phone. if you are dumb enough to think a 135 dollar smart phone will run as well as a flagship smart phone. still though come on Microsoft put in the software so your X phones so they can access and run Google play sore apps. if you do these smart phones will sell OUT!.

Was reading some user opinions about Nokia X and people have been having trouble running whatsapp. Go to youtube and there are several videos showing tips and tricks on how to get whatsapp working properly coz this Nokia X platform doesn't play well with whatsapp android. Pretty shocking, especially considering that the typical Nokia X buyer isn't gonna be the geeky type so they will be totally clueless. Also weird since Nokia went to all the trouble of woowing whatsapp onto their S40 and Asha phones - but now they let something like this happen? This whole Nokia X project looks like a half-hearted attempt and an EPIC FAIL!.

You can install apps from Third party store. But message appears if you install apps from third party store then nokia company is not responsible for data theft of mobile damage other than nokia.com. Even after installing it it never works. I installed compass but it shown the message that magnetic field not available. Bluetooth works only for nokia handsets Nokia care center themselves told to me. To connect to PC you need to install nokia suite. Even then it may or may not connect to PC. Can't install whatsapp and so many other apps. Only thing is camera is good. Overall even cheapest local brand smartphones are far better than nokia Smartphones..

Esto también se puede leer en español.. Nokia's best Android phone, but not good enough. The Good The Nokia XL has a solid build quality, a powerful battery that lasts a full day on a single charge, and two SIM cards.. The Bad The XL's processor is slow, and its touchscreen is occasionally unresponsive. The poor screen resolution and unattractive UI severely hinder the user experience. You can't access the Google Play store and Nokia's app selection is very limited.. The Bottom Line Despite having the best specs of Nokia's Android phones, the XL's poor performance and confusing OS denies users Android's full potential and a true Windows Phone experience.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Availability and the Nokia X family Man, is that a bright shade of green. Design and display The XL's volume rocker and power control are on its right spine. The XL's unique -- and sometimes frustrating -- user interface. The Nokia XL is big, but it doesn't have the display resolution to match. Software and apps The Nokia XL has two SIM card slots. It's not an exaggeration to say that the Nokia XL truly belongs in a class by itself, but I don't mean that in a good way.. Part Windows Phone, part Android handset, but really neither, the Nokia XL uses the same that we saw on the Nokia X. So, if you can imagine it, that means it runs on Google's code, but with a Windows Phone-like interface. What's more, Nokia has removed access to the Google Play features -- a vital part of the Android experience -- and replaced them with Microsoft and Nokia services.. The result is a confusing mess that doesn't really know what it is. Though you get Nokia's superior build quality, its features, performance, and disjointed interface make it not worth the trouble of figuring it out. Yes, it comes at a low price, but the real cost is a very different user experience.. 5-inch Nokia XL blends Android, Asha, Windows Phone (pictures). The XL is available unlocked in select countries around the world, though primarily in emerging markets in Asia. In the US, it sells for as low as $149, a price that fits its middling features and performance. In the UK, the average price is around £150. Availability and pricing for Australia are yet to be announced, but it directly converts to AU$160.. Compared with Nokia's other X series that the company announced at this year's Mobile World Congress , the Nokia XL is the flagship model with the biggest screen and the best specs. It has more RAM than the Nokia X, for example, a bigger display than the new X2 , and a better camera than both the X and the Nokia X+.. The Nokia XL's 5-inch screen makes it the biggest phone of the X series. Unfortunately, though, Nokia didn't give it the resolution to match. The WVGA display supports just 800x480 pixels and 187 pixels-per-inch. That gives it the same resolution as the X's 4-inch screen but clearly not the same pixel density (233ppi).. That also doesn't compare to the Moto G ($179/£115/AU$245), which has a pixel density of 329ppi, and the Moto E ($129/£90/AU$179) with its 256ppi resolution. So, what does that all mean? In short, it means that the XL's resolution and color accuracy are disappointing. What's more, the viewing angles are poor, and because the screen is not bright enough, it's difficult to read outdoors.. With such a big display, the XL borders on phablet-like dimensions measuring 141.4mm (5.5 inches) high by 7.77cm (3.06 inches) wide by 10.9mm (0.43-inch) deep. Though I could hold the XL comfortably, at 190g (6.7-oz) it's definitely one of the heaviest devices of its size. In comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 weighs 168g (5.93-oz) with a bigger screen size of 5.7 inches, and the 5-inch Nokia Lumia 930 weighs 167g (5.89 oz).. Instead of the three menu buttons on most Android devices, the XL has only one, which lets you go back or return to the home screen if you press and hold. One difference between the XL and the X and X+ is that it has a front-facing camera (2 megapixels) just above the display.. I was glad to see that the XL has the build quality that I've come to expect from Nokia phones. No, it's not quite as luxurious as the company's most high-end Lumia devices, but its construction felt solid in my hand.. Similar to what Nokia offers in some Lumia devices, you can choose between different colorful covers, such as the bright green (almost blinding) version that was my review unit. Under the back cover you'll find the 2,000mAh battery, as well as the microSD and dual SIM-card slots.. The Nokia XL main camera lens in the back (similar to the camera on the Moto G and Moto E ), a flash LED and a speaker grill. Besides having the highest-resolution shooter of the X family, the XL is the only handset with an LED flash. The right edge of the device sports the power button and the volume bar, while the top edge houses its 3.5mm headphone jack and the bottom edge the micro-USB connector.. The XL runs on Nokia X software, which is an Android-based OS. It tries to simulate the Windows Phone experience, and it lacks Google Play store access as well as the Google services that you find on most Android phones, such as Google Maps and Gmail. Instead, Nokia and Microsoft use their own apps like Bing search and Here Maps. If you're able to find the APKs for the Google apps, you can install them. However, you'll need to root the device to do so, and if you do that, remember that you'll void your warranty.. In the end, this distinct interface drastically impacts the user experience that you'd expect from an Android phone. For instance, your contacts, calendar, or music will not sync automatically, nor will you download the Google Play purchases that you've made in the past (music, movies, TV series, apps, books, and so forth). Of course, you can transfer your contacts manually one by one (and watch paint dry while you wait), or use the pre-installed Bluetooth app by pairing your old and new phones. Depending on the number of contacts you have, this could take a while.. Along those lines, don't get your hopes up about having access to the Google Play store. As mentioned, Nokia replaces it with its own version of an app store that falls short of Google's array of choices. Fortunately, though, you can download a third-party app store like 1MobileMarket to install some of your favorite apps that are nonexistent in the Nokia Store.. As for the interface, Nokia cleverly tries to pitch an experience similar to that of the Lumia line, but it ultimately stumbles by delivering a confusing mix of Android and Windows Phone characteristics. For instance, similar to Windows Phone, you can make tiles bigger and change the color of each tile (when it is not a standard app from Nokia or Microsoft). And as with Android, you can create folders and add widgets.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges..

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 4 GB + MicroSD. View all photos (31). Click to read the full review. Based on 4 User reviews. Too little RAM memory (0.75 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (187 ppi). Nokia XL is a fairly large, 5-inch device, in tune with the times. As far as the Android platform is concerned, at least. The resolution of the IPS LCD panel, at 480x800 pixels, is nothing to write home about -- it adds up to 187 pixels per inch, which ain't a whole lot. Under the hood, you'll find a 1GHz dual-core Snapdragon 400 chip from Qualcomm, and 768MB of RAM.. Nokia XL Review Nokia XL hands-on Nokia XL benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.57 x 3.06 x 0.43 inches (141.4 x 77.7 x 10.9 mm). Weight: 6.70 oz (190 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Colors: Black, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, White. Display Physical size: 5.0 inches. Resolution: 480 x 800 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Digital zoom. Settings: ISO control, White balance presets. Resolution, 864 x 480 pixels 30 fps. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 16.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 30.0 days (720 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 13.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA 7.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s.

Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. GPS, A-GPS, Cell ID, Wi-Fi positioning. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Review talking about - Read all Great camera Reviews. BASED ON 2,564 RATING(S). 19 May 2014 By zahara begum On flipkart.com. i bought this phone and using this phone. Here are some pros and cons of the phone.nnPros:nn1. 5 inch screen with good viewing anglesn2. 5 MP camera with flash and Auto focus (Auto focus is missing in Nokia X and X+ and Moto E)n3. 2MP Front camera for video calln4. Decent Ram and good processing powern5. Biggest disadvantage is the Video recording capability as it is limited to 480 P. Cannot play 720P videos which is laggy in MX player H/W mode. Able to play it in software mode but still can feel the lag.n3. Low resolution display and No clear black display. Low resolution does not affect much because phone use big fontsn4. Though it is 5 inch phone is wide and thicker than most of the 5 inch phone in the market. Google play service and apps incapability. We will be missing the cream of Google apps like playstore, Youtube etc. Although we can install third party store like One store, not all the apps are compatible like Dead trigger, beach buggy blitz etc. Other games like temple run, asphalt 8 and, subway surfers will play decently.n6. 24 May 2014 By Ankit Bhurane On flipkart.com. A very good phone from Nokia. I was waiting for this phone from a long time. I was about to buy Moto E but went for Nokia XL. Both are at their own place as per as price and specifications are concerned. I purchased this phone from Nokia priority store is Amravati, Maharashtra (I was first to buy this phone in that area). Later I purchased one more on behalf of my friend. Here are my reviews.nnPros:nn1) Who says it does not support WhatsApp? It does!!! Its available on the store/ third party store. I have installed it and it works smoothly. Indeed, it supports almost all the apps including Google Maps, Skype, WhatsApp, Cam Scanner, Papyrus, Mozilla firefox browser, etc. I am using them! Let me know if someone face problem installing them. If someone face problem accessing the WhatsApp through its official app, one can use 'WhatsApp Plus' to access your account. Its too good! :)nn2) Its 5 inch device with excellent build quality and awesome looks. When held in hands, it looks bold and beautiful.nn2) 5 Mp camera capture does good job of capturing the details. nn3) 2 Mp front camera is just superb, as I frequently make call on Skype.nn4) Interface is simple and elegant and fast lane feature is really good. If one doesn't like the Nokia lumia kind of user interface, one can install the launcher app which changes the interface to classical Android phones.nn5) Battery is good. It last for a day with normal use of browsing, calls, and camera. nn6) Powerful Snapdragon processor and RAM does a good job.nn7) I have installed one of the famous game "Temple Run 2" and it works smoothly.nn8) Personal experiment: Rooting Nokia XL allows phone flexing all its muscles. Voila! You can then install play store and enjoy all the apps :) Rooting will void warranty of your phone, so try at your own risk.nnCons:nn1) Although it does good job of capturing snaps, video recording is not that good.n2) Video at resolution 1280x720 (HD) plays smoothly with software decoder (an option in the MX player) but lag a lot for 1920x1080 (Full-HD) video (it was not designed for this)nnOverall the phone is really good for day-to-day use and not that good for high end users.

Nokia XL – Smartphone 5 inch, chạy Android đầu tiên của Nokia Thiết kế đẹp, rực rỡ màu sắc Hệ điều hành mang phong cách riêng của Nokia Màn hình rộng 5 inch rực rỡ, sắc nét Cấu hình tốt, giải trí mượt Camera 5MP với chất lượng hình ảnh tốt Tóm lại:. Sau một thời gian dài mong ngóng giờ đây dàn smartphone Android đầu tiên của Nokia đã xuất hiện. Cùng với Nokia X , X+ , Nokia XL đã được tung ra với nhiều sự bất ngờ, được thụ hưởng kho ứng dụng của cả Nokia, Microsoft và của cả Google và trở thành sản phẩm đầu tiên có sự kết hợp hoàn hảo giữa 3 ông lớn trong ngành di động.. Nokia XL mang phong cách riêng của Nokia. Thiết kế bên ngoài của XL sẽ khiến người dùng nhớ đến dòng điện thoại. Lumia của Nokia, vẫn giữ phong cách trẻ trung, đầy năng động, sản phẩm sử dụng chất liệu nhựa nhưng được gia công một cách tỉ mỉ, có đường nét đặc trưng riêng.. Đặc biệt thiết bị vẫn được thiết kế với rất nhiều màu sắc rực rỡ và dĩ nhiên phần vỏ có thể tháo rời để có thể thay thế dễ dàng. Phía trước màn hình bạn có thể thấy rằng chỉ có duy nhất một nút cảm ứng, thay vì sử dụng đến 3 nút như các thiết bị Android khác, nút này có tác dụng như nút Back, khi ấn và giữ thì nút này có tác dụng là nút Home để trở về màn hình chính.. Phần nắp lưng phía sau của máy ôm rộng ra cả cạnh phía trước, do đó khi nhìn trực diện bạn vẫn có thể nhìn thấy phần viền màu phía sau, giúp trang trí luôn cho phần trước của máy. Bề mặt phía sau máy được phủ một lớp sơn mịn, không bám dính, cảm giác cầm khá thích tay, màu sắc trên chất liệu này cũng được làm khá nhẹ nhàng không quá chói, mang đến cảm giác thân thiện hơn cho sản phẩm.. Nokia XL cho cảm giác cầm nắm khá thoải mái dù chỉ bằng một tay. Điều khiến mọi người tò mò hơn cả đó chính là hệ điều hành Android lần đầu tiên được xuất hiện trên sản phẩm của Nokia. XL sử dụng hệ điều hành của Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean nhưng được Nokia tùy biến theo phong cách riêng của mình. Không hỗ trợ các ứng dụng của Google như Gmail, Google Maps và Play Store như thường thấy trên các sản phẩm Android khác, Nokia sử dụng kho ứng dụng riêng của mình nhưng vẫn hỗ trợ đến 75% ứng dụng Android có thể chạy được trên Nokia XL.. Ngoài ra Nokia cài đặt sẵn những ứng dụng cốt lõi đều là của Nokia và Microsoft, điển hình như ứng dụng bản đồ của Nokia, công cụ tìm kiếm Bing, kho lưu trữ của Microsoft.. Nokia XL được thiết kế giao diện bên trong giống như các sản phẩm chạy Windows Phone của mình, dù là hệ điều hành Android nhưng sản phẩm lại sử dụng giao diện dạng ô vuông, có thể được tùy biến dễ dàng tương tự như giao diện của Windows Phone.. Giao diện dạng ô vuông tượng tự như trên Windows Phone. So với hai người anh em của mình là X và X+ thì Nokia XL được trang bị màn hình kích thước lớn hơn do đó những trải nghiệm mang đến cũng thú vị hơn rất nhiều. LCD rộng đến 5 inch độ phân giải ở mức độ trung bình nhưng nhờ màu sắc sống động, độ phân giải. nên chất lượng hình ảnh trông khá nịnh mắt.. Nokia cung cấp cho sản phẩm một màn hình có độ sáng cao, góc nhìn rộng do đó nó khắc phục được nhiều hạn chế khi sử dụng như bị lóa sử dụng ở ngoài trời.. Màu sắc trên Nokia XL được thể hiện rất rực rỡ. Nokia XL là thiết bị có khả năng giải trí cao như lướt web, cập nhật tin tức, xem phim, nghe nhạc. Đặc biệt là với màn hình rộng đến 5 inch thì những trải nghiệm càng thú vị và thoải mái hơn. Bên trong XL được trang bị bộ xử lý lõi kép Snapdragon S4 của Qualcomm dung lượng RAM 768MB, có hỗ trợ thẻ nhớ ngoài.. Sản phẩm hỗ trợ nhiều định dạng video nên nó giúp bạn chơi tốt các phim, video chất lượng cao như HD hoặc Full HD. Hơn nữa GPU Adreno 203 giúp thiết bị có thể chạy mượt mà các game , đáp ứng nhu cầu giải trí của người dùng.. Smartphone 5 inch đầy hấp dẫn của Nokia. Trong cuộc đua camera trên thị trường smartphone thì Nokia là một hãng sừng sỏ nhất, gây được nhiều ấn tượng với rất nhiều tính năng cao cấp trên camera. Thừa hưởng những kinh nghiệm đó Nokia XL cũng được trang bị một chiếc camera khá tốt.. Sản phẩm sở hữu hai chiếc camera trước và sau tương đương là 2MP và 5MP, camera trước cho chất lượng hình ảnh rất tốt, màu sắc đẹp, tươi sáng, một điểm nổi trội hơn một số sản phẩm cùng phân khúc khác.. Camera chính phía sau được trang bị thêm đèn flash LED, có hỗ trợ tính năng nhận diện khuôn mặt, tự động cân bằng trắng, tự động lấy nét và đáng chú ý là có thể chụp Panorama mang đến những bức ảnh hết sức ấn tượng, màu sắc mang tính nghệ thuật cao.. Camera phía sau được làm khá gọn gàng. Nokia XL mang đến những trải nghiệm hoàn toàn mới, khác biệt so với dòng Lumia trước kia của hãng. Là một sự kết hợp độc đáo giữa hệ điều hành Android, giao diện Windows Phone, ứng dụng của Nokia và Microsoft, tất cả được kết hợp một cách hoàn hảo và tạo nên một sản phẩm rất đáng để trải nghiệm..

The 5-inch Nokia XL is the largest in Nokia's family of affordable Android-running phones, but just like all the rest in the X series, you'd find it hard to recognize it as an Android phone.

Nokia has only gone and done it. The Finnish firm, married to Microsoft and the Windows Phone platform, has launched not one, but three Android devices - and the Nokia XL is the daddy of the bunch.. With a 5-inch display the Nokia XL dwarfs the 4-inch X and X+, but with a quoted price of just €109 (around £90, $150, AU$160) you'll struggle to find a smartphone this size for less.. In terms of specs the Nokia XL arrives with a 1GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor, 768MB of RAM, 4GB of internal storage, 5MP rear camera and a 2MP front facing snapper.. Considering the price it's not a bad setup, and the low internal storage can be boosted by a microSD card, plus the Nokia XL comes with dual-SIM capabilities.. The main attraction on the Nokia XL is its operating system, which is built on the Android open source platform, although the heavy modification it's undergone means it's unrecognisable in terms of any Google affiliation.. It's currently called Nokia X software platform 1.0.1 - not quite as clean or pretty as iOS 7 or Android KitKat , but it's a start.. In fact Nokia has omitted Google's cloud in favour of Microsoft's services, making sure the Nokia XL still has a core integration with the Finnish firm's parent company.. What does this mean then? Well the Nokia XL has a far wider range of applications than the Windows Phone-toting Lumia handsets, although you can't go through Google Play.. Instead you have to use Nokia's own Store, providing a more handpicked selection of Android apps. If the app you want isn't there, you can always use third party stores to get your favourites onto the XL.. Swiping from right to left on the lock screen takes you to the homescreen on the Nokia XL, which is made up of a series of tiles similar to Windows Phone.. These tiles can be moved around by holding and dragging, and you can increase the size of your most important apps from 1x1 to 4x4. Some apps will also pull through additional details, such as the gallery showing previews of your images.. As you move a tile around the screen the other apps dance out of its way, rearranging the whole shebang - although everything is a little jittery as the dual-core processor and 768MB of RAM struggle with the movements.. I also found the Nokia XL took a while to boot up, and there was some noticeable lag when it came to creating folders and stick apps into them - vital for keeping your homescreen tidy.. A swipe sideways from the homescreen takes you to the "Fast Lane", a running feed of all the latest activity on the Nokia XL, be it recently used apps, music controls or notifications of a new message, call or social interaction.. The Fast Lane adapts to your usage the more you use the Nokia XL, and you can hide certain information to give you just the things which are important to you.. General navigation around the Nokia XL tends to be smooth, but although it isn't the slickest of operators - considering its price point these are things I can just about accept.. Instead of the likes of Google Maps and Play Music, on the Nokia XL you instead get Here Maps, Here Drive, free Mix Radio music streaming and Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage.. The large screen of the Nokia XL means it's ideal for viewing maps, and Nokia's Here service can save them all offline for browsing anytime, anywhere.. At 800 x 480 the display on the Nokia XL isn't going to win any awards for clarity, but it still provides a decent viewing experience and I found text was easy to read. It does allow for better gameplay and movie watching - although quality won't be great.. The handset itself follows Nokia's current design ethos of minimalist style and bright colours with orange, blue, yellow and green available alongside the more muted black and white options.. It's quite blocky though, and at 10.8mm deep the Nokia XL is one of the chunkier smartphones around.. I found the angular edges weren't overly comfy when held in the hand, although the mono body design is sturdy.. You can peel off the coloured casing of the Nokia XL to gain access to the dual-SIM slots and microSD port, plus the removable 2000mAh battery which Nokia claims is good for 13 hours of 3G talktime, or 26 days on standby.. The speaker on the rear of the XL can kick out music at quite a volume, but I did find it would distort if I turned it up too high.. A centralised power/lock key resides on the right of the Nokia XL, just below a volume rocker switch, but unlike the Lumia range of devices there's no dedicated shutter button here.. Nokia has loaded up the camera app with a buffet of features including colour effects, face detection and controls for brightness, white balance, contrast and saturation.. I found the shutter and auto-focus to be a little slow off the mark, but the Nokia XL managed to take some decent pictures of the busy demo area.. It's currently not clear whether the Nokia XL will make it to the likes of the UK, US and Australia, but the handset is confirmed for areas of Eastern Europe and other emerging markets.. The Nokia XL is aimed at a narrow area of the market and it's a smartphone which will likely have big appeal in emerging markets, but less of a presence in more developed areas.. A look at the price point and the spec sheet confirms this, but the fact Nokia has done a big screen device which has its roots in Android could be a sign of things to come from the Finnish firm.. What is a hands on review?. 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

Great performance on accessing all my documents via my Microsoft account and also One Drive. Having all my documents handy on the go, really cool. The Nokia XL has a large screen with an excellent response time. The camera (back and front camera) delivers photos in very high quality. This counts as well for Skype chat (Skype app comes along with the phone), it is very good video quality. The battery keeps loaded for a good amount of time, i recharge usually once a day one full re-charge. The only dis-advantage of this phone is that not all apps can be downloaded via Microsoft.

Not to be confused with Nokia Xseries or XpressMusic .. Microsoft Lumia 435 and 532. The Nokia X family was a range of smartphones that was produced and marketed by Microsoft Mobile , originally introduced in February 2014 by Nokia. The smartphones run on the Nokia X platform , a Linux based operating system which was a fork of Android. Nokia X series ran on Symbion S60 5th Edition which existed since the late 1990s many years before Android existed please repair page to relflect fact) Nokia X is also a model of phone, known generally as the Nokia Normandy. as per Wikipedia pages Nokia X6 system is Symbion S60. The first Android device Nokia made, and came as a surprise as the company was in its Microsoft partnership and was in the process of selling its mobile phone business to Microsoft, which eventually happened two months later. Nokia X phone known as: Nokia Normandy, Nokia A110, Nokia X Dual SIM RM-980 with dual-SIM card slots is the only phone Nokia released using Android prior to Microsoft purchasing the Mobile Division of Nokia.. The Nokia X devices heavily resemble the newer (50x and 230) Asha phones, and also contain some Lumia features. They have a single "back" button like the Asha 50x and 230. A "home" button was added to the X2 series when they were released in June 2014. [2] They are affordable, low-cost smartphones that were only sold in emerging markets, and never made its way to Western Europe or North America.. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop called it the Nokia X family during an announcement, possibly to distinguish it from the unrelated Xseries that ran from 2009 to 2011.. In July 2014, Microsoft Mobile announced the end of the X range after just five months (as well as Asha and Series 40 ) in favor of solely producing and encouraging the use of Windows Phone products. 2.3 Nokia XL 4G. Despite choosing the Windows Phone operating system for its Lumia series of smartphones, Nokia had experimented with the Android platform in the past. Images of a Nokia N9 running Android 2.3 were leaked in 2011. They were believed to be genuine, as Steven Elop mentioned Nokia had considered using Android at one time. On 13 September 2013, the New York Times writer Nick Wingfield revealed that Nokia had been testing the Google Android operating system on its Lumia hardware. Another project, known as "Asha on Linux", used a forked version of Android without Google services. The Asha series previously ran the Java-based Series 40 and Asha platforms. These were not as functional as a similarly priced low-end Android handset, a price range that Windows was not able to provide Windows Phones in. [6] Meltemi (operating system), a Linux-based operating system designed to replace Series 40, had been scrapped by the company. The Chinese technology site CTechnology revealed that despite the announced merge of Nokia with Microsoft, development of the Asha on Linux project was continuing until November 2013 and 10,000 prototype units had been manufactured by Foxconn , containing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 8225Q chip. A report by Tom Warren from The Verge on 11 December 2013 showed an Asha-like device, codenamed "Normandy". He said that "despite the finalisation of the acquisition, development of the device is continuing." [9] As of late January 2014 the deal stands as not finalized because of scrutiny from Chinese regulators. [10] ) AllThingsD suggested that Microsoft may not stop development of the device. A 14 December 2013 report by CTechnology claimed that the device development had been halted, along with an Android-based 7 inches (18. The two projects were to have been created by Nokia's CTO division, which Microsoft did not acquire, with Peter Skillman, the head of UX Design, at the helm of the UI design. The report said that wearable devices were the new focus of the CTO division. A further leak by @evleaks showed a press image with several colour options for the phone. According to NokiaPowerUser , the device was dual-SIM with a 4 inches (10. cm) display, the model number was RM-980, and it had a 640×360 resolution. [16] In a second report, they suggested the device may be a member of the Asha range, as the development team was headed by Egil Kvaleberg (from Smarterphone ), and the UI led by Peter Skillman (who worked on the Asha Platform's Swipe UI). A tweet by @evleaks on 31 December 2013 stated that " The reports of Normandy's death have been greatly exaggerated ". A leak on the ITHome technology website showed a blurred image of the phone, and the app drawer of its UI in operation, confirming it to be a dual-SIM device. However, no Nokia logos were found on the device. @evleaks later posted screenshots of the UI, showing the lock screen and Skype in action. The device later showed up on the AnTuTu benchmark software as Nokia A110 , with KitKat 4.4.1 , a 5MP camera and an 854 x 480 display. Two new photos of the Engineering prototype were leaked in January 2014. [22] One shows a different app launcher than previous photos, suggesting a placeholder. On 13 January 2014, a press photo showing the tile-like UI of the home screen was leaked, [24] and was accompanied by a screenshot of the Asha platform's Fastlane -style notification centre the next day. [25] According to Eldar Murtazin, Microsoft was not keen on the idea, saying there were "too many politics" around the project. He claimed it would have to be released in February, before the acquisition of Nokia was completed, if at all. [26] Another source suggested Microsoft would use the device as a trojan horse to increase Windows Phone adoption. The phone (with the model code RM-980) was certified by the Indonesian authorities on 21 January 2014, suggesting a close launch date. On 23 January 2014, Nokia sent out invitations to its press event at Mobile World Congress on 24 February 2014, where the device would be unveiled, if it wasn't cancelled. @evleaks later tweeted that the name of the phone is Nokia X. A few days later, the specifications were leaked by @evleaks. The device had a dual core Snapdragon processor, 512. GB internal storage memory, a 1500. MAh battery, Nokia Store and third-party app stores, confirming its placement into the low-end market segment. On 30 January 2014, the French website nowhereelse.fr released more photos of the device, showing its form factor and rear view for the first time. According to GoAndroid , an anonymous Senior Nokia Executive Officer in India revealed that the device would debut in India in March 2014 under the Asha line. NokiaPowerUser later revealed that the phone gained certification in Thailand and Malaysia. The Wall Street Journal 's sources confirmed that Nokia was going to reveal the device at the MWC in Barcelona at the end of February 2014. Reports from Artesyn Technologies and tech.qq said Nokia X is the first of several Android devices from Nokia, including high-end models. These additional devices, one named Nokia XX , would be released during May or June 2014, and were claimed to be out of beta and would possibly receive FCC certification.
