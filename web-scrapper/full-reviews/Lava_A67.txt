I am fond of taking pictures and its 5 MP rear camera and 2 MP front camera and both with LED flash helps me click amazing pictures. One more thing I love is its battery of 2000mAh which gives talk time of approx. 13 hours when I listen music in speaker and of 35 hours when I listen music in earphones. Everything is just better but the one thing which I feel could be better is the Android version which is Android 5.1 Lollipop and get it upgraded to Android Marshmallow.. 3 - 5 K Phones all phones. 4G: Not Available, 3G: Available, 2G: Available Fingerprint Sensor.

FCC ID value: BCG-E3091A link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $355 Buy. $475 Buy.

Lava A67 - user opinions and reviews. This phone is not at all gud....I recommend othes not to buy this phone... Few months ago I brought my lava mobile that time it was working well & now I put it on charging it's not showing anything when I turn on the mobile the notification of battery over temperature your phone Will shut down in this seconds now what should I do. Its is really a fine phone and is best than the other in the same price range.. What a stupid phone is this!! Bought it in Oct 2016... n from the last 2 months its troubling me so much!! Games r automatically getting downloaded...some issue with d sound recorder...always getting hanged...took it to d service center...they updated d software...but still the same problem persists... lava A67 is very good mobile phone for this price range compare other brand. I've just bought this phone last week. It's camera is good but others features are making me really mad. I can't receive videos using Xender from other mobiles. I can't open any videos or photos from SD Card. It constantly shows up a notification that says... I can't download videos from WhatsApp. I'm gonna sue this for good.. dis phone better than any micromax opppo and lenovo phone. lava nos better than Chinese brand. Hello I have buy this mobile one week ago.It is really good it is better than my previous mobile it has some new specification.. lava phones are famous for their sturdy built quality. Which is clear from basic to top models. This phone also has better build quality than Micrmax, Karbon and Intex etc. Other than that phone is good. You can compare this with Panasonic T 50. If you really need samsung kind of camera quality in a basic pjone, better go for Mi redmi 2. Which is 2k expensive than this. HI have buy the mobile 1 week ago its functioning is good but battery drains soons & phone gets heated up when you use youtube & now i am facing a new problem when i m inserting my sd card its not showing me its showing me safley removed your sd card i thought my sd card got corrupted but when i inserted in another mobile its working so dont buy cheap things just spend some more money & buy another company mobile. So have been I really like the fact that this company is accomplishing one milestone after another. Specifically on paper specs like the big screen-5";decent camera of about 5MP rear camera; passable battery of 2000mAh. Considering the price of 4.5k, its seems like a decent second option for me cuz im on a budget!. Lava A67 really has some amazing features at a cheap price! I mean with a 5 inch screen,. 5 MP camera and other add on feature like the smart music and other seem like too good to be true! The only think is on budget on 6K does this option seem fair?.
