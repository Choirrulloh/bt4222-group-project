CNET también está disponible en español.. Huawei's Honor View 10 doubles down on the big blues. The Honor View 10 costs a lot more than its recent sibling the 7X, but on paper it's not much of an upgrade.. by December 5, 2017 11:51 AM PST. Big screen, blue shell: It's the Huawei Honor View 10. Huawei Honor View 10 specs 6-inch screen 2,160x1,080-pixel resolution 3,730mAh battery (non-removable) Kirin 970 processor, 6GB RAM Fingerprint scanner below screen 13-megapixel front camera Dual 20- and 16-megapixel rear cameras. Huawei-owned Honor in November launched the Honor 7X -- an almost 6-inch Android phone with a decent set of specs and an affordable price tag of £269. Its new phone, the View 10 looks almost identical, has a slightly boosted processor, a fingerprint scanner on the front rather than the back, and it costs a more sizable £449.. Those prices convert to $360 and AU$475 for the 7X; and $600 and AU$795 for the new View 10. It's due to go on sale globally in January.. The biggest upgrade over the 7X comes in the form of the processor. The View 10 packs Huawei's latest Kirin 970 chip. It has eight cores and it's backed up by 6GB of RAM. I haven't fully tested the phone yet, but it's the same processing setup found on Huawei's new Mate 10 Pro ( $738.11 at Amazon.com ) -- an extremely powerful phone. I expect the View 10 to be similarly capable.. Both Huawei and Honor's main claims for the processor involve AI, with apparent improvements to image recognition in the camera (allowing for faster automatic settings changes) and faster language translation from words in a picture.. Physically though, there's little to tell Honor's two new phones apart, with both sporting all-metal bodies and a matte blue finish. The View 10's 5.99-inch display is marginally bigger than the 7X's 5.93-inch screen, but both have 2,160x1,080-pixel resolutions. For the extra money Honor is demanding, I'd like to have seen a pixel boost here.. Neither phone has any kind of waterproofing, which is frustrating -- again, adding this to the View 10 would have helped separate it from its cheaper sibling and give a real reason to spend the extra cash.. The View 10 has a dual-lens camera (like the 7X), which takes depth information in an image to let you produce portraits with DSLR-style out of focus backgrounds..

Huawei Honor View 10 hands-on review. Huawei Honor View 10 specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (28). Huawei Honor Android Preview. Honor View 10 at a glance. Body: Aluminum back, 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3 on the front. Midnight Black and Navy Blue color schemes (Beach Gold, Aurora Blue, Charm Red, Night Black in some markets). Display: 5.99" LTPS LCD, 2,160x1,080px resolution, 403ppi. Rear cameras: Main camera: 16MP, f/1.8, color. Phase detection autofocus; f/0.95-f/16 aperture simulation. Front camera: 13MP, f/2.0 aperture; fixed focus. OS/Software: Android 8.0 Oreo; Huawei EMUI 8.0 custom overlay. Chipset: Huawei Kirin 970: octa-core CPU (4x2.36 GHz+4x1.8 GHz), Mali-G72 12-Core GPU. Memory: 4/6GB of LPDDR4X RAM; 64/128GB storage; hybrid microSD slot for expansion (shared with SIM 2 slot). Battery: 3,750mAh Li-Po (sealed); Huawei SuperCharge proprietary fast charging (5V/4.5A). Connectivity: Dual SIM; 4G VoLTE on both cards; USB-C (v2.0); Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac; GPS, GLONASS, Beidou; NFC; Bluetooth 4.2. Misc: Front-mounted fingerprint reader; single speaker on the bottom; 3.5mm jack.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro at half the price - that would be the Honor View 10. Made official in China last week, the View 10 was just announced for the world, and we were there for some hands-on action.. Now, the Honor View 10 may share the form-factor and some of the hardware with the top-of-the-line Mate 10 Pro, but certain things didn't make the cut. Two-hundredths of an inch smaller than the Pro's, the display is not AMOLED, but LCD instead - still in an 18:9 ratio and with a 1080p resolution.. Moving on, the Leica branding has been stripped, though the camera configuration is still a similar color + monochrome duo - 16MP + 20MP in this case, each behind a f/1.8 aperture lens. On the front, the View 10 could have the upper hand - it packs a 13MP f/2.0 camera vs. The chipset is the same Kirin 970 powerhouse you'd find on the Mates, RAM's plenty at 4GB or 6GB, and you won't be strapped for storage with either the 64GB or the 128GB option, plus there's a card slot if you do end up needing more.. A few mAh have been chiseled off the battery capacity, but the 3,750mAh powerpack isn't exactly tiny. The Huawei SuperCharge 5V/4.5 charger is quite beefy itself, and Huawei promises 0-50% in 30minutes - our experience doesn't leave us doubting.. Huawei didn't bother with weather sealing on the Honor View 10, and it has no IP rating - you do need to step up to the Pro to get that, as not even the regular Mate 10 is properly protected (just IP53 on that one). But hey, Mate 10 Pro, show us your 3.5mm jack. You can't, can you? The Honor View 10 swaps out the dongle for a built-in headphone jack, just the way it should be.. Anyway, let's not get hung up on the jack debate, and move on to the hands-on. Join us on the next page.. Huawei Honor View 10 specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (28).

The Huawei Honor View 10 is an attractive phone with a tall and narrow build, dual camera sensors, and a dedicated AI processor for performance that gets better over time. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus. PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page.. The Huawei Honor View 10 is an attractive phone with a tall and narrow build, dual camera sensors, and a dedicated AI processor for performance that gets better over time.. Huawei is going all in on machine learning. The company's Honor View 10 is its latest phone to boast a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU), letting it run AI computations with greater efficiency than a CPU or GPU alone, similar to the Mate 10 Pro. It also boasts solid specs with a dual-camera system, a snappy Kirin 970 processor, and tons of storage. We don't know how much it costs, or if it will be available in the US, but we did get to spend some time with an early model and have some initial impressions.. The Honor View 10 has a smooth aluminum unibody design available in black or navy. I noticed the black model seems to easily pick up fingerprints and smudges, but it's nice and grippy compared with the slick Honor 8 .. It may not have a glass back like the Galaxy S8 or iPhone X, but the View 10 follows the other prevailing trend of 18:9 screen ratios by adopting a tall-and-narrow body with most of the front dominated by a 6-inch screen with a narrow bezel on the top and bottom. Beneath the screen is a home button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor.. Left to right: Honor 7X, Honor View 10. The phone measures 6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 6.1 ounces, similar to the OnePlus 5T (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.7 ounces) and Honor 7X (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.8 ounces). The narrow form factor makes it fairly easy to hold and use with one hand since you can reach across the screen without issue.. The screen itself is a 6-inch, 2,560 by 1,080 panel, which works out to 403 pixels per inch (ppi). That's a bit low compared with the Quad HD panel on the Samsung Galaxy S8 (570ppi), though it basically matches the OnePlus 5T (401ppi). It looks plenty sharp in person and doesn't have any immediately noticeable pixelation. Huawei's EMUI also offers plenty of customization so you can change screen temperature and color saturation to your preferences. Viewing angles and visibility in a brightly lit room were good.. Under the hood, the View 10 is packing plenty of power. The battery is a plentiful 3,750mAh cell, which should provide lots of juice. For reference, the 3,300mAh OnePlus 5T lasted for 7 hours and 10 minutes of LTE video streaming, so we expect the View 10 will deliver similar performance.. The phone has a Kirin 970 processor clocked at 2.4GHz. That's the same powerful chipset as the Mate 10 Pro, and similar to the OnePlus 5T. In the time I spent with the View 10, performance seemed smooth, with no noticeable stuttering or slowdowns. The phone also has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a microSD card slot that can work with cards up to 256GB or a second SIM.. See How We Test Cell Phones. There's a dual 16-megapixel/20-megapixel rear setup that allows for a bokeh mode, improved low-light performance, and true black-and-white shots. The most notable feature is that the NPU is able to help the camera recognize scenes and adjust settings to take the best shot. For instance, it may tweak ISO or white balance if you're taking a picture of text in a book versus trying to capture something in low light. If you're snapping something bright like fruit, color saturation may be dialed up.. The cameras also support 4K recording at 30fps , but don't appear to have optical image stabilization. The front camera is a 13-megapixel sensor that took clear shots.. Left to right: Honor 7X, Honor View 10. LTE bands include 1/3/5/7/8/30/38/40/41, but again there is no confirmation if the phone will be compatible with US carriers. It also has dual-band Wi-Fi and NFC for mobile payments, but still has Bluetooth 4.2, rather than the newer 5.0 standard. It does support aptX, though, allowing for higher-quality Bluetooth transmissions with compatible devices.. The View 10 runs Huawei's newest EMUI 8.0 on Android Oreo , which means a revamped interface with app icons, settings, and features that are different from what you find on stock Android. Most notably, the phone benefits from the AI intelligence. Like the Mate 10 Pro, it will automatically manage memory better, recognize pictures, and offer suggestions such as prompting you to enable eye-care mode late at night. It should also smooth out performance by identifying the apps you're likely to run at a given time and setting the stage for you to use them.. The phone also supports face unlocking, similar to the Apple iPhone X. I t doesn't have the same IR sensors in the front, however, so we'll have to wait and see how reliable it is.. Overall, the Honor View 10 looks like a solid phone, on par with the Mate 10 Pro. Depending on the price, it'll likely compete against the OnePlus 5T, which shares a similar design and feature set, but lacks the dedicated NPU. We don't have details on the View 10's price or availability yet, but if it launches in the US we'll be putting the phone through its paces and updating this story to a full review.. Bottom Line: The Huawei Honor View 10 is an attractive phone with a tall and narrow build, dual camera sensors, and a dedicated AI processor for performance that gets better over time..

Subscribe here to further receive Related Stories, Product Reviews, Launches & Best Deals. Huawei Honor View 10 is currently available at the best price of: ₹29,999. If you were looking for an affordable flagship smartphone, chances are you were looking at a OnePlus device, or a previous generation smartphone that saw a price cut. A lot of smartphone makers have realized that the 30 to 40k price point is a lucrative market. It is also the sweet spot where a smartphone offers flagship like features but doesn’t cost you a kidney. We have seen devices like the Nokia 8, LG V30+, Sony XZ1 and more launch in the 30K to 45K. Today we have with us the Honor View 10. The smartphone boasts of an impressive set of specifications, and features that can give any flagship a run for its money. It is priced at Rs 29,999 in India which is very competitive, especially when you consider the international pricing of the device. Does it have what it takes to take on the likes of the Nokia 8, OnePlus 5T and others?. CPU: Hisilicon Kirin 970 Octa-Core CPU. OS & UI: Android 8 with EMUI 8. Sleek, well-built and attractive are the first things that come to mind when you see the Honor View 10. Sure, it has a protruding dual-camera setup at the back, but we aren’t complaining about it since there are a bunch of phones that have it and we’ve grown to live with it. Besides, once you put a case on the smartphone (the one that comes in the box), everything is OK. I would have appreciated an Honor 8 Pro like seamless design with the camera though.. 5.99-inch 1080p display in the new 18:9 form factor. the fingerprint sensor, which is more convenient over havng it at the back. I personally prefer a front-facing fingerprint sensor and I’m glad that the smartphone has this. The side bezels around the phone are slim. The bottom of the device has the speaker grille, USB-C port, and the 3.5mm headphones jack. The back of the smartphone is smooth and our. premium in terms of material used as well as the fit and finish, though it doesn't boast of any extraordinary design elements that can make it stand out. case adds grip to the slippery metal smartphone and also solves the problem of the protruding camera. Single handed operation will be a task on this device and you won’t be able to access the top third of the smartphone with your thumb.. As you may have noticed, the View 10 has an 18:9 display. A lot of apps in the Play Store have been updated to take advantage of the new form aspect ratio. Those that haven’t work perfectly fine, but. The smartphone also gives you the option to scale apps that aren’t optimised for the display, which is nice. When you power up the phone and start using it, the display looks good. You can watch YouTube, Netflix, play a bunch of games and it will work quite well. Out of the box, the display tilts slightly towards the cooler side and has a blue tint. This is a little surprising since it has an LTPS IPS display. In the settings, you have the option to manually control the colour temperature along with default options like warm and cool.. You also have the eye comfort mode in the display settings. With an FHD plus display, the Honor View 10 Plus isn't the most pixel dense or the most vibrant displays around, but it also doesn't suffer from any drawbacks or issues when it comes to the basics. We wish the brigthness levels were a bit higher though, along with better performance under direct sunlight.. The display to beat (and compete) for the View 10 would be the one on the OnePlus 5T.. The OnePlus 5T has an Optic AMOLED display. default settings, the OnePlus 5T doesn’t have a blue tint and the offers better contrast and overall performance in comparison to the View 10. Though all that also comes at a. We ran the Spiderman Homecoming trailer on both the smartphones and the outcome was more vibrant on the OnePlus 5T’s display. The Honor View 10 produced good true to source colours with a slight blue bias on the display (which was corrected by manually controlling the. The sound from the mono speaker is adequate. You can enjoy a YouTube video at full volume in a decently populated noisy office and still get by without feeling the need for higher decibel levels. Playing games like Asphalt 8, you hear the punchy sounds of crashing other cars coupled with the nitro injection. The smartphone still retains the endangered headphones jack which is a crucial inclusion for most buyers.. Kicking things off with the UI, if you have used an Honor phone in the past, you will feel right at home. The Smartphone runs on Android Oreo out of the box (something the OnePlus 5T doesn’t), skinned with the companies own EMUI 8. If you like, you can have an iOS-like layout where all the apps are present on the home screen. Or if you are one that prefers an app drawer, then that option is there too. The phone comes with a bunch of pre-loaded apps and games similar to what we have seen on the Honor 7X .. One of the pre-loaded apps on the device is the Microsoft translator app. The app is available for Android on the Play Store, but Honor has partnered with Microsoft and preloaded the app on the smartphone. The functionality doesn’t differ when the app is used on any other Android device.. We tried translating from English to Hindi and the experience wasn’t perfect. There are times when the app translated what I said well and there are times when it was way off. We are still looking for people who speak Spanish or Czech, Danish and more to try the app. But between English and Hindi, the experience has its shortfalls.. The app has the ability to translate text too. So, if you are reading a menu in another language, you can click a picture of the menu in the translation app and see it in your choice of language.. Another interesting feature of the smartphone is how you can use the home button. Just like Moto gestures on the Moto phones, the Honor View 10 has fingerprint sensor gestures. You can touch the fingerprint sensor to go back, touch and hold to go back home and slide left or right to see the multitasking menu. It’s quite functional once you get used to it and I liked it. It also frees up the displays real estate from onscreen buttons.. Honor brings with it an interesting UI and it is one that grows on you. It gives you enough customization to keep thing interesting and for the duration that we used the smartphone, the UI was fluid.. What according to you qualifies as AI? Is it the ability of your smartphone to tell you how much traffic there is before you leave for work? Is it a smart assistant? Is it the camera’s ability to identify the scenario and click better images? We are in the nascent stages of AI on a smartphone. The Honor View 10 brings with it camera enhancements which is related to AI, but the other features are more features than AI enhancements. The question remains, are these enhancements useful or gimmicky?. Before we begin, we’d like to tell you that the ability to unlock the smartphone with your face isn’t available and will come as an OTA update in the coming days. There are however a few features that we did put to test.. The camera of the smartphone can intelligently recognise the person, object or place you are at. For example, if you point the camera at a person, it says “optimized for portrait mode”. But this object recognition didn’t always work. It sometimes recognized the cup on my table and sometimes it didn’t. More on this in the camera section later.. Another interesting feature is that when you receive notifications, the smartphone will only show you the notification without showing you the content of that notification. When the person with the registered face looks at the phone, you can see a small preview of the notifications, like you would on any android device. This is a nice privacy setting as none can see your notifications unless you look at the device. This is a feature we have seen on the Apple iPhone X.. Another useful feature (but not necessariy AI), is how it manages display orientation. the auto rotate on and lie down while texting, and the smartphone won't. The smartphone realizes that you are texting and stays in landscape mode.. If you have set your display to go to sleep in 15 seconds and are reading a news story or a website and don’t touch the display for 15 seconds, it won’t go to sleep. The phone will realize that you are reading and wont lock the display. These are smart and useful features, but we've seen such eye tracking/app aware features in. smartphones launched way back in 2013 (Samsung S4?). Esentially, the AI hype around the smartphone could have been toned down quite a bit.. There are more such features scattered throughout the device.. Apart from the camera which can intelligently recognise the scenario and enhance the image accordingly, the other features can’t technically be classified under AI. You have a simple translation app that comes preloaded, something you can achieve with an app on the PlayStore. Others are trickery using the gyroscope and front facing camera of the device.. Overall, it will be quite a while before we see true AI on a smartphone, but the move is in the right direction. Today I can use, “OK Google” to click a selfie but I can’t say “OK Google, lock my phone” to lock my phone. Unlike Samsung which has Bixby, The Honor View 10 doesn’t have its own assistant. It relies on Google assistant and that’s OK. The features I mentioned above may not be AI related but they are handy. Orientation staying the same when you want it to, the display not going to sleep when you are reading a book, are good examples of features that once enabled can be taken for granted and that is a good thing. But again, they can't be classified as AI features. Under the hood the device is powered by the Hisilicon Kirin 970 (10nm). For those of you interested in the benchmark scores, here you go. For everyday use the smartphone is butter smooth. Animations are swift, apps open almost instantly, games run without any glitches, there is really nothing I can tell you about the performance that has a significant drawback in real world scenarios. Apps crashed randomly once or twice on me, but that’s really nothing to talk about in the grand scheme of things. It can go toe to toe with the performance of the any flagship on offer today. Even after about 6 months of use, if the performance dips about 10 to 15 percent, the phone will still be pretty smooth.. When it comes to gaming, from Farm Hero Saga to Asphalt 8 and even Max Payne, the games are super smooth. Low load times and consistent high frame rate makes the gaming experience fun.. The Honor View 10 has a 16MP+20MP RGB+Monochrome setup at the back. Put simply, images clicked from the phone in both day light and low-lit shots are good. The only downside is the inconstancy with which photos are clicked. In well-lit conditions, you get good photos. The Bokeh images clicked on the View 10 are better than those we have seen on the OnePlus 5T. When it comes to low light, in some images, the View 10 gives good images with low noise. On other occasions, the low light images don’t preserve the details of the image and the white balance is off.. The front facing camera offers few nifty featues,. with the single front facing camera, etc. The Bokeh images of the front facing camera aren’t Pixel 2 grade as they lose out on edge details of the subject. In normal scenarios, the front camera produces good selfies, but it does. evidently softens details on the skin.. Below are some camera samples from the smartphone (scaled for web). If we were to draw a comparison with the OnePlus 5T, the Honor View 10 is in the same league with better low-light performance and noise management. What holds it back though is. the inconsistent whitebalance and occasional highlight clipping. When you consider the price however, at Rs, 29,999, the. Honor View 10 has the best camera of all phones in 25-32K price range.. Another area where the Honor View 10 impresses is with the battery life. You can easily run the device for a work-heavy day with. little gaming and video content consumption among the daily routine of calling, messaging, social networking and more.. After a work day, I had about 40 percent battery left which is better than most phones I’ve used. It better my daily driver, the OnePlus 5T by about 10% in battery life. Which is good for a non-AMOLED display based flagship phone with a 6-inch screen.. It’s a lot cheaper than the OnePlus 5T so the value for money proposition is right there. Apart from the display which has a slight blue bias, the phone overall can take on any phone in its price bracket and emerge victorious – be it with the battery life, raw performance and gaming.. The Honor View 10 is a very competitively priced device in India especially if you consider its price internationally. For Rs 29,999 you get a well-built phone which is fast and fluid, runs the latest OS and has a good battery life. The camera is good too with the only problem being the blue bias with the display which can be corrected if you manually change the colour temperature. The features that come under the AI umbrella may not be true AI, but the fact is that they work. With the exception of Microsoft translation app, all the other features mentioned just work.

CES showcases the tech trends that will shape the year ahead. See the most important products that will impact businesses and professionals.. Honor has built a reputation for delivering good handsets at an attractive price. Launched at the same time as the mid-ranging Honor 7x , the new flagship Honor View 10 boasts features like a dual-lens camera an 18:9, 6-inch 1,080-by-2,160 screen and 128GB of storage. These are topped off with the latest must-have feature -- artificial intelligence, based around Huawei's latest Kirin 970 processor.. The View 10 is a clear competitor for the OnePlus 5T and also has enough punch to be a competent rival to the Huawei Mate 10 Pro -- at a considerably lower price than Honor's parent-brand flagship handset.. The Honor View 10 has a deep blue chassis which looks distinctive (the colour is an Honor favourite) and the matte finish to its backplate is reasonably grippy. The antenna bands are neatly disguised as black strips at the very top and bottom of the back. There's not much to distinguish this phone from any other handset with an 18:9, 6-inch screen these days, but there are a couple of points to note.. The Honor View 10 has a 5.99-inch screen and is powered by Huawei's latest AI-augmented Kirin 970 chipset.. The first is the presence of a fingerprint sensor beneath the screen, in contrast to both the Huawei Mate 10 and the OnePlus 5T, which both put their sensors on the back of the handset. The rear-mounted option is much more ergonomic for one-handed use, and is my preferred location.. Even though the sensor is on the front of the chassis this isn't an overly tall handset. Measuring 157mm tall by 74.98mm wide by 6.97mm thick, and weighing 172g, there's not much between this and either the Huawei Mate 10 Pro or the OnePlus 5T (see table below).. The other notable design point is that the two camera lenses protrude significantly from the back of the chassis. To be fair, the Honor View 10 is just 6.97mm thick, and a raised camera lens area can also be found on the somewhat thicker OnePlus 5T, although the single raised lozenge on that handset deals with the situation rather more neatly.. The handset is only 6.97mm thick, which means the rear camera lenses protrude noticeably.. The right side power button is slightly etched, presumably to help you locate it by touch alone, but I didn't find that this helped much. The fact that the handset's only other button, the volume rocker on the same edge, is much longer, is the real clue as to which button is for which function.. On the bottom edge you'll find the USB-C port for charging, and a 3.5mm headset jack. So there's no need to give up on a wired 3.5mm headset here, as Huawei wants you to do with its flagship Mate 10 Pro. The speaker grille is on this edge too.. Download now: New equipment budget policy (free PDF). There's no IP rating for dust and water resistance on the View 10, which might put a few potential buyers off. It's also worth noting that I was able to get a very slight amount of flex in the chassis by trying to bend the phone in my hands. However, this isn't a major concern.. The screen has the 18:9 aspect ratio that's become a popular choice. It measures 5.99 inches across the diagonal with a resolution of 1,080 by 2,160 pixels (403ppi). It's clear and sharp, and the IPS LCD panel delivers plenty of punch even if it doesn't look as vibrant as an OLED. Those looking for a bit more 'pop' from the screen can switch into Vivid mode, and it's also possible to adjust the colour temperature. Video looks great in wide-screen mode, and the speaker delivers good enough audio quality for a bit of headset-free catch up TV.. User-adjustable settings are available for the IPS LCD screen, including a Vivid mode.. The Honor View 10 will accommodate two SIMs, but unlike on the OnePlus 5T the second SIM slot can also be used for a microSD card. That means it's possible to augment the internal storage. My review unit had 116GB free out of the box, and with 128GB microSD cards available for under £40, it's relatively affordable to more than double the internal storage capacity.. The Honor View 10 is powered by the same octa-core Kirin 970 processor that Huawei uses in the Mate 10 Pro, and it shares the neural processing unit (NPU) that deliver AI features designed to accelerate the handset's performance.. Among the features on offer is fast multilingual translation via the installed Microsoft Translator app, and an intelligent photography service that automatically recognises what you're trying to photograph and adjusts the settings automatically. It correctly identified my cat, a plant, and my lunch, for example, but is also easily fooled: it identified cats, plants, and food from web photos too -- well, it's not human.. The NPU's other main claim to fame is its ability to learn about how you use your handset, and so anticipate what you might need at certain times. It's a moot point whether prioritising particular processes, and deprioritising lesser used apps, is useful given the speed with which the processor can start up apps and processes anyway.. See also: Hardware purchasing task list. Android 8.0 is overlain by Huawei's EMUI 8.0 , which adds a raft of features over and above the Android standard fare. There are plenty of granular settings to be found that could confuse or delight, depending on your fondness for fiddling around. They include the ability to use either an apps drawer or to show all apps on a home screen, plus the display tweaks mentioned earlier. For all its complexity, EMUI is much less obtrusive than it once was, and the better for it.. There are dual cameras at the back -- 20-megapixel monochrome and 16-megapixel colour -- that combine to deliver pretty good images. There's a bokeh mode, and the aforementioned ability to automatically identify what's being photographed and adjust settings accordingly. A sweep to the right brings up Pro Photo mode, where you can adjust detailed settings and access other shooting modes.. Monochrome photos are effective, and there's a good editing app that includes a range of potentially useful and fun effects and filters. The 13-megapixel front camera shoots a nice selfie and can use a subset of the available range of camera modes.. With all the configurability options, the advanced processor and the good cameras, it's somewhat surprising that there's no facial unlocking. The Honor website says this will be coming through an OTA update, but right now the fingerprint sensor is the only biometric authentication method available.. Honor adds a few applications to the standard Android fare, including several game demos, utilities like a compass, and a controller for the built-in IR blaster.. The 3,750mAh battery is surprisingly large for such a slim handset. According to Honor, it's good for 5.5 hours of gaming, 19 hours of video, 160 hours of music, 21 hours of 4G browsing, or 23 hours of 3G talk. Support for Honor Supercharge means the battery can get a 50 percent charge in half an hour. I'd expect this handset to get most users through a full day between charges and found power boosting to be impressively quick.. It seems odd for Huawei to push a budget brand that offers such great value for money and effectively rivals its own flagship Huawei Mate 10 Pro. But that's exactly what's happening here. The more expensive Huawei handset does offers advantages such as its Leica-branded camera system, more solid build, an IP rating, a slightly larger (4,000mAh) battery, and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.. But if you're looking for great features and performance on a budget, the Honor View 10 stands alongside the excellent OnePlus 5T.. Flagship smartphones: Specs, benchmarks and prices for iPhone, Samsung, Huawei and more Updated to include OnePlus 5T, BlackBerry Motion and HTC U11+ specs. Here's how the top end of the smartphone market looks at the moment.. Honor 7X review: Better than its predecessor and priced 20 percent less At just $200, it's tough not to recommend the Honor 7X for first-time smartphone owners, younger customers, and those looking to get 90 percent of the functionality of a high end flagship for a fifth of the cost.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro review: A feature-packed flagship with extra AI Huawei's flagship Mate 10 Pro is bursting with features. A great screen, very good battery life and widespread use of AI make it a pleasure to use, while IP67 protection is welcome.. OnePlus 5T review: Flagship smartphone quality at half the price The OnePlus 5 was an outstanding handset back in June, and the new 5T model is even better, at the same price.

The Honor View 10 comes with 5.99-inch 18:9 aspect ratio full HD+ display with 1080×2160 pixel resolution. Beneath that, the View 10 is by powered company’s own latest octa-core Kirin 970 processor coupled with 6GB RAM and 128GB. The storage can further be expanded up to 256GB via microSD card. In optics, the Honor View 10 features a 20-megapixel and 16-megapixel sensors with f/1.8 aperture at the back. While at the front it has a 13MP selfie shooter. To strengthen camera experience the phone further relies on AI and machine learning. And as per Honor’s claims, View 10 can use AI to recognize multiple scenes and objects and automatically adjusts the camera settings for the perfect shot. Out of the box, the phone runs on an EMUI 8.0 based 8.0 Oreo out of the box and packs a 3750mAh battery with fast charging support. Despite the full vision display, the Honor View 10 features a fingerprint sensor on the front just below the display. It is also inducted with face unlock feature. In terms of connectivity, the Honor View 10 offers dual-sim, 4G, VoLTE, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, USB Type-C and NFC.

You can subscribe to Smartprix notification to get an instant update on the availability and pricing details of Honor View 10.. 18:9 display Dual-camera Front Fingerprint Sensor Fast Processor. Honor included an 18:9 display with FHD+ resolution (1080x2160px) and it looks pretty good. It has great viewing angles with no color shifting. The phone was able to reach a great 506 nits of full brightness. This was achieved in Auto mode, however. Switch Auto mode off and the phone will display 453 nits when the brightness meter is cranked up. The Honor View 10 is powered by a large 3,750 mAh battery, which is rechargeable using Huawei's Super Charge adapter.. Well-constructed hardware Excellent performance and stable software Very good cameras IR Blaster is a rare feature these days Great display with above average sunlight legibility. Cameras stick out despite not having OIS No video stabilization Tired hardware design. The View 10's back design is totally different, though, more conservative and pragmatic than some of this phone's pricier rivals. The View 10 has a fingerprint scanner on the front, and it's a fantastic one. So fast you can barely believe it's actually scanning your digit, it's a joy to use. The phone also has the latest among screen trends with an ultra-narrow surround that makes the image appear to cover almost the entire front of the View 10.. Great value Good screen Long battery life. Slightly loose camera exposure metering Non-stabilized camera No water resistance. From build quality to battery life and performance, the View 10 leaves little to be desired and gives the OnePlus 5T a run for its money in the budget flagship category.. Premium build quality and modern design Oreo out of the box Solid camera performance Impressive battery life. EMUI still isn't for everyone No water/dust resistance Fingerprint sensor is a bit too small. The Honor View 10 is available in Navy Blue (the model reviewed) and Midnight Black. The phone features an aluminium rather than glass back, which we are fine with even though it doesn't deliver any wow-factor, and the sides of the device are nicely bevelled, too. The screen surround is also very slimline, which helps to emphasis the size of the 5.99-inch screen.. Dual-lens camera system 5.99-inch, 18:9 screen 128GB internal storage Dual SIM capable Runs Android 8.0 Oreo. LCD screen only No water resistance. Has volte problem which makes receiving and making calls difficult. Has volte problem which makes receiving and making calls difficult.

Aditya Shenoy , 05 January 2018. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Honor View 10 is powered by a Huawei Kirin 970 processor. It has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. Dual 4G and VoLTE let you access 4G networks on both SIMs. Honor View 10 look and feel Honor View 10 specifications Honor View 10 software and features Honor View 10 performance, cameras, and battery life. 2017 was the year when most smartphone manufacturers began shifting. Honor was one such company, launching one phone after another following this trend. We saw the Honor 9i. and the Honor 7X ( Review ) being introduced in the sub-Rs. The company is now targeting a higher price point with its Honor View 10 .. ( Review ), its flagship for 2017, managed to shake the market up while competing against the OnePlus 5. It packed in good hardware and managed to undercut the OnePlus offering on price as well. Now, the Honor View 10 is on the same path, and offerse better hardware to take on the competition. It is powered by Huawei’s latest silicon, the Kirin 970, and has a stronger focus on artificial intelligence with what the company calls a "neural-network processing unit". Honor claims that the new chip is capable of learning your behaviour patterns, helping you take better photos, and translating multiple languages in real time. So should the View 10 be your smartphone of choice for 2018? We find out.. The design of the Honor View 10 is in line with the current market trend of taller screens and narrower borders. It sports a big 5.99-inch display with the 18:9 aspect ratio. It has thin borders on the side and comparatively thicker ones on the top and the bottom. The selfie camera and earpiece grill are above the screen, along with an array of sensors, and there's a fingerprint scanner below it. Honor offers the View 10 in two colours:. We had a Navy Blue review unit, and it looked somewhat similar to the colour of the Honor 8 Pro. The View 10 sports a metal unibody. Its flat back has antenna bands running along the top and bottom. It has dual cameras and a single-LED flash at the back, similar in design to the setup seen on the Honor 7X. The lenses protrude out of the body causing the phone to rock when kept on a flat surface. They both have metal surrounds which protect them but feel rough.. The sides are curved making the phone comfortable to hold, although the flat metal back can. be a little slippery in the hand. Honor has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right, and while the power button is easy to hit, you will need to stretch your thumb to hit the volume up button. The hybrid dual-SIM tray is on the left. The View 10 sports a USB Type-C port at the bottom along with a speaker grille and 3.5mm headphone. At the top, the View 10 has a secondary microphone and an IR emitter that can be used to control IR devices.. a 3750mAh battery and supports the company's own Supercharge standard. Sadly, Honor does not ship the required 5V, 4.5A charger with the phone in India. Instead, you will find a standard charger in the box that isn’t as fast. You get a screen protector pre-applied on the View 10, and a clear case bundled in the box.. The View 10 is Honor's new flagship offering, and like other phones at this price, it is loaded with features. The screen is an IPS panel, measuring 5.99 inches with an FHD+ (1080x2160). Viewing angles are good and the screen was usable under direct sunlight. We liked the output of the display and the fact that the phone let us adjust the colour temperature. Display modes are also provided, which let you choose between neutral and vivid colour reproduction.. The fingerprint scanner below the display is quick to unlock the phone. Honor also claims that the View 10 is capable of using your face to unlock the smartphone, but this feature is not enabled yet. At the time of our review, the Face Unlock feature could only be used to show notifications on the lock screen. Honor told Gadgets 360 that the full feature will be rolled out via an OTA update.. The Honor View 10 is powered by a Huawei Kirin 970 SoC, which is an octa-core processor, with four cores clocked at 2.36GHz and the other four clocked at 1.8GHz. The Kirin 970 has a dedicated Neural Network Processing Unit (NPU) which is tasked with handling Artificial Intelligence functions. Huawei claims that the dedicated NPU computes AI tasks faster than the CPU, while being more efficient. The Face Unlock feature and the cameras on the Honor 10 use this NPU. Honor ships the View 10 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which is expandable by up to 256GB using a microSD card in the hybrid dual-SIM tray.. The Honor View 10 supports 4G as well as VoLTE connectivity on both SIMs, which means that both cards can access their respective 4G and VoLTE networks. With most current phones, only the SIM in the primary slot can access a VoLTE network, but this doesn’t seem to be the case with the View 10. The phone could register our Jio and Airtel SIMs on their respective networks independently. However, this isn't the same as being a Dual-SIM Dual-Active phone, because when one network is engaged in a phone call, the other SIM is still unavailable to anyone who tries to reach you. Honor has come up with a call forwarding option that lets you transfer calls to the active number automatically. For data, of course, the phone only lets you select a single network at a time.. The View 10's dual rear cameras. consist of one 16-megapixel RGB sensor and one 20-megapixel monochrome sensor. At the front, there is a 13-megapixel selfie shooter that is also used for the Face Unlock feature. In terms of connectivity, the View 10 supports Bluetooth 4.2, dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, and USB-OTG. For positioning, it has GPS, APS, GLONASS, and BDS.. Like all other Honor phones, this one runs EMUI, Huawei’s UI layer on top of Android. The View 10 runs EMUI 8 with quite a few customizations on top of Android Oreo. There is theme support, letting you change the way the UI looks to suit your preferences. Smart gestures help you interact with the phone, such as flipping it over to mute it and picking it up. Knuckle gestures let you double-knock with one finger to take a screenshot, or two fingers to begin screen recording. You can also launch apps by tracing letters on the screen. If you think this sounds complicated, it is. Honor has crammed in a lot of such features, and while the screenshot gesture was useful, the others felt gimmicky. We also found a lot of sub-menus in the Settings app, and it was sometimes hard to get to a specific setting without using the search function.. Honor offers a one-handed mode which is very useful when handling this big phone. You can also opt to disable the on-screen navigation buttons and instead tap, long press, or swipe the fingerprint scanner to simulate the Back, Home, and Overview button actions respectively. While this is fairly easy, we found it less convenient than a similar implementation on Motorola phones.. For security, Honor offers a Private Space that lets you have a completely different profile secured using a different fingerprint and passcode. File Safe encrypts files on the phone which can then only be decrypted using an alphanumeric passcode or an associated fingerprint, and App Lock lets you restrict access to apps using a fingerprint. While you won't have to search for multiple apps to do these things if you want them, learning all the features of this phone can be a little overwhelming.. You also get dual app functionality called App Twin which lets you run two instances of supported apps.. Honor ships the phone with a few preinstalled apps. Apart from Honor support apps, there are quite a few demo versions of games. To showcase its AI capabilities Honor has also preloaded Microsoft Translator which is not the same as the version available via the Google Play store. While you can chat with other people using text and have it translated on the other end using the regular app, you can also do this with voice on the View 10. It isn't clear whether this feature is coming to all phones or whether it is exclusive to the View 10 (or other devices with specific capabilities), but we were able to use it with the other party using a Google Pixel 2. It worked fairly well translating between English and Hindi, though context was sometimes missed.. Flagships aim to provide the best usage experience,. and the Honor View 10 isn’t any different. Huawei’s Kirin 970 processor is quite potent and the 6GB of RAM makes usage quite smooth. Apps launch quickly, and multitasking is easy. The View 10 managed to score 173,982 in AnTuTu, and. also scored 1,900 and 6,709 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. This phone managed to surpass the Google Pixel 2. ( Review ) while coming within striking distance of the OnePlus 5T. In GFXBench, the phone managed 59fps, and 31,347 points in 3DMark Unlimited.. We played Shadow Fight 3 and Clash Royale, and faced no issues with gameplay. Like most other phones with 18:9 screens, many apps and games don’t use all available space and run at 16:9. Honor gives users the option to scale compatible apps to the new ratio. EMUI's Game Suite feature claims to boost. the phone's performance when gaming, and also suppresses notifications to prevent interruptions and disables the navigation keys to prevent accidental touches. The speaker on the View 10 is loud but is also very easy to cover when holding the phone in landscape mode.. Battery life on the Honor View 10 is decent thanks to the 3750mAh battery. We managed to run the phone past one day with light to medium use, and it could manage one day when we included some long gaming sessions. In our HD video loop test, the phone lasted 11 hours, 14 minutes before running out of juice. EMUI has battery saving modes that. Ultra Power Saving Mode restricts the phone to only calls and messages so that it can run for significantly longer. Just like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Samsung Galaxy S8+ , Honor lets you lower the resolution from FHD+ to HD+ which should be beneficial to battery life. It also has a smart setting which automatically switches resolutions. based on what you are doing with the phone.. Other than face recognition and the translator app, the cameras are where the Honor View 10 puts its NPU to use. familiar if you've used other Honor devices, but look deeper and you'll see that there are more options and an AI-powered scene detection mode. The View 10 uses the NPU to try and understand subjects in a frame and then use the best possible settings according to its algorithms. We found the AI-powered auto mode to be accurate and fast enough to set the scene up before we hit the shutter button.. There's an Artist mode that lets you apply filters before taking shots. Monochrome mode utilises only the 20-megapixel monochrome sensor to take photos, and the AR mode applies effects after detecting faces. There is Pro mode for photos and videos that lets you manually set different parameters of the camera.. Tap to see full-sized Honor View 10 camera samples. Photos taken with the View 10 are good in daylight when the lighting is favourable. Landscapes are good and colour reproduction is fairly accurate. Objects at a distance do lack detail, but macros are far better in comparison. The camera is quick to lock focus and captures details very well. The View 10 does detect specific subjects such as plants and animals rather than just conditions such as low light, and the resulting settings are fine. However, there's no way to turn this off to gauge how much of a difference it really makes compared to standard scene detection that many other phones offer. In low light, the View 10 managed to surprise us in a few shots. It was able to capture good. details and handled noise fairly well. If the light source is far away, the camera is quite aggressive with noise reduction, which results in loss of detail.. Selfies are usable, and can be enhanced using the beautify mode. Most of the time, the portrait mode worked well in blurring backgrounds and making subjects stand out. If there are multiple faces in a frame, the phone attempts to leave all of them unblurred regardless of depth, which looks extremely artificial.. Video recording maxes out at 4K for the rear camera and you do also have the option to shoot at 1080p at 60fps. The front-facing camera maxes out at 1080p but if you want beautification mode enabled on video, the output is restricted to 720p. Also, we couldn’t find any video stabilisation options on the phone so you will need to have a steady hand while recording.. Verdict With the View 10, it is clear that Honor is being extremely aggressive in terms of features and pricing. It packs in the latest silicon from Huawei and the AI buzzwords will grab attention in the market. The hardware is all quite capable and is in line with current flagships from other manufacturers. Honor ships the phone with Android Oreo out of the box which is another plus. Priced at Rs 29,999, the Honor View 10 undercuts the OnePlus 5T. ( Review ) on pricing by quite a bit. If you are on the 18:9 hype train looking for a bargain, the Honor View 10 looks like a strong contender at its price..

While you'll find better cameras elsewhere, in almost every other way the Honor View 10 is a match for far pricier phones, making it a great buy for the budget-conscious flagship fan.. Honor View 10 price and availability Out now in the UK Confirmed for the US Costs £449 (around $600/AU$775) Key features High-end features at an aggressive price Masses of storage High-end Kirin CPU Design Slimline screen surround Aluminum rear, slim frame Great fingerprint scanner Screen 5.99-inch LCD screen Customizable display tone Ultra-wide 18:9 aspect ratio. If the high prices of today’s top-end phones make you feel a little queasy, alternatives like the Honor View 10 and OnePlus 5T should have your attention. They cost half the price of an iPhone X , but still offer high-end features and a contemporary design.. Phones like this are an excellent argument for why few, if any, of us really need to spend a huge amount on a new mobile, even if we are getting more demanding by the year.. There's the odd Honor quirk, and the design isn't quite as glitzy as that of the smaller Honor 9 or its 'sister' phone of sorts, the Huawei Mate 10. But it's hard to beat in terms of pure value among high-end mobiles.. Watch the video below to see more about the design of the Honor View 10.. At its announcement there was a lot of talk about the Honor View 10's price. It hadn't been revealed properly, and the success of this model depends largely on how competitive its price is.. The Honor View 10 costs £449 in the UK. That equates to around $600 / AU$775, although we may well see even more aggressive US pricing.. As yet though, while the company has confirmed that the Honor View 10 will launch in the US it hasn't said when or for how much, and there’s no word on an Australian launch.. That price makes the phone, surprisingly, a little cheaper than its arch-rival the OnePlus 5T in the UK. The Honor View 10 has 128GB of storage, and the 128GB version of the OnePlus 5T costs £499 / $559 / AU$699.. Shipping initially on January 8 in the UK, the Honor View 10 also has the honor, no pun intended, of being one of 2018's very first releases.. It's hard not to love the core aim of the Honor View 10. It's out to provide much of the hardware and features of the biggest names, but at a much lower price. Sure, you don't get a brand name that as many friends will recognize, but if it saves you £300/$300, are the bragging rights really worth it?. And if you must brag, you can still boast about bagging a bargain.. Excellent features for the money include 128GB of storage, the advanced Kirin 970 chipset also seen in the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, and a 20MP/16MP dual-camera array on the back that offers low-loss 2x zoom.. The phone also follows the latest trend in displays with an ultra-narrow surround that makes the image appear to cover almost the entire front of the View 10.. You miss out on very little of importance with this phone. Just like the Honor 9 before it, the Honor View 10 is impressive.. The Honor View 10 looks similar to other late 2017/early 2018 phones front-on. There's just a thin band of border around the display; like its rivals, Honor has pushed for less wasted space.. It's just about the only way to make a phone with a 6-inch screen that doesn't demand extra-wide pockets. Honor hasn't tried to hide what small bits of surround exist, though. They're ultra-glossy blue in the model we reviewed, looking like the finish of last year's excellent Honor 9.. The View 10's back design is totally different, though, more conservative and pragmatic than some of this phone's pricier rivals. Its rear is aluminum and, unlike the old metal iPhones, the sides and rear are separate parts.. While there's some attractive beveling to the side's edges, you can imagine this style might have been used to lower production costs.. Today’s phone material of choice is glass too, rather than metal. The iPhone X uses it, as does the Samsung Galaxy S8 , with aluminum seen by some as 'mid-range'. This is a slightly ridiculous notion, but those obsessed with being on-trend may disagree.. The Honor View 10 is extremely thin, however. At 7mm thick it's thinner than the iPhone X or Galaxy S8. It's so thin, you have to wonder: why?. An extra 0.7-0.8mm of chunk wouldn't hurt the View 10's design much, and would allow for a larger battery and avoid the dual camera lenses sticking out on the back – as it is they look like a pair of Minion™ goggles.. However, as the colored aluminum of the rear is almost certainly going to get damaged before anything else, you may want to consider a case anyway. And all of our criticisms are quibbles. The Honor View 10 is a well-made, attractive phone, and its price rival the OnePlus 5T also uses aluminum on its rear.. Like the Honor 9, the View 10 has a fingerprint scanner on the front, and it's a fantastic one – it's so fast you can barely believe it's actually scanning your digit, and it's a joy to use.. Dig into the Settings menu and you can also use the scanner to replace the on-screen home keys. We wouldn't recommend this to most, though, as the slim surround design leaves virtually no breathing room between the scanner and display.. Look on Honor's website and you'll see it promises Face Unlock as a View 10 feature, but it's not here yet, rather it's promised as a software update. What we have for now is something rather more unusual. You can teach the phone your facial geometry and it'll blank out the notification details on your lock screen until it recognizes your face with the front camera.. This is a neat idea, a less critical way to implement facial recognition more simplistic than the iPhone X's, although we've found it struggles to recognize faces in dim indoors lighting or under high-contrast lighting. And you can't see your notifications unless you're looking at the display dead-on.. One of the few obvious hardware sacrifices of the View 10 is water resistance. The phone has no official water resistance, although we'd hope there's a degree of water protection in the charging port. It's worth noting though that the Huawei Mate 10, a similar but far more expensive phone, also lacks water resistance.. There are also some ways in which we're glad the View 10 hasn't followed the 'trendy' flagship crowd. There's a headphone jack where several of the most expensive phones have rejected them (for no obvious benefit), and despite the phone having a huge 128GB of storage you can still add a microSD card – the SIM tray has a slot for one.. The Honor View 10 has a 5.99-inch IPS LCD screen, with a stretched-out Full HD resolution of 1080 x 2160. This display is similar to that of the OnePlus 5T, except that it uses an LCD panel rather than an OLED one.. The difference? OLEDs tend to have richer color and always have better contrast thanks to their light-emitting pixels, but LCDs can look sharper than an OLED of the same resolution, as most OLED panels in phones use 'shared' sub-pixels.. We'd suggest not getting too hung up on the differences here, though, because the quality of the Honor View 10 minimizes their importance. Colors look great, the display is sharp despite having far fewer pixels than a Samsung Galaxy S8, there's barely any brightness loss from an angle, and contrast is excellent.. At an angle, in a dim room, you can see the backlight luminescence, though, and fresh out of the box the View 10's colors are a little hot, typical of the standard screen calibration of any high-end Android. However, if you like a more relaxed tone you can switch from Vivid mode to Normal in the phone's display settings.. Like other Honor phones, the View 10 also has a color temperature wheel that lets you make the screen appear warmer or cooler, or give it a (slightly) more specific color skew.. As this will probably be your first phone with an ultra-narrow screen surround, though, it's the shape of the View 10's screen that's one of the most important elements. This doesn't feel like a 6-inch screen because it's only really longer than the norm, not wider. It feels more like an ultra-widescreen take on a 5.5-inch phone.. Games look great on the View 10's screen, as do cinema-aspect movies.. Next Page Battery life and camera. You can unsubscribe at any time and we'll never share your details without your permission..

Oppo Unveils the F1s smartphone in India. Reliance LYF Smartphones Get A Price Cut. The Huawei Honor View 10 is an attractive phone with a tall and narrow build, dual camera sensors, and a dedicated AI processor for performance that gets better over time. Cell Phone Reviews Huawei Mate 10 ... Apple iPhone X LG V30 OnePlus 5T. Huawei is going all in on machine learning. The company's Honor View 10 is its latest phone to boast a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU), letting it run AI computations with greater efficiency than a CPU or GPU alone, similar to the Mate 10 Pro. It also boasts solid specs with a dual-camera system, a snappy Kirin 970 processor, and tons of storage. We don't know how much it costs, or if it will be available in the US, but we did get to spend some time with an early model and have some initial impressions.. The Honor View 10 has a smooth aluminum unibody design available in black or navy. I noticed the black model seems to easily pick up fingerprints and smudges, but it's nice and grippy compared with the slick Honor 8 .. It may not have a glass back like the Galaxy S8 or iPhone X, but the View 10 follows the other prevailing trend of 18:9 screen ratios by adopting a tall-and-narrow body with most of the front dominated by a 6-inch screen with a narrow bezel on the top and bottom. Beneath the screen is a home button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor.. Left to right: Honor 7X, Honor View 10. The phone measures 6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 6.1 ounces, similar to the OnePlus 5T (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.7 ounces) and Honor 7X (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.8 ounces). The narrow form factor makes it fairly easy to hold and use with one hand since you can reach across the screen without issue.. The screen itself is a 6-inch, 2,560 by 1,080 panel, which works out to 403 pixels per inch (ppi). That's a bit low compared with the Quad HD panel on the Samsung Galaxy S8 (570ppi), though it basically matches the OnePlus 5T (401ppi). It looks plenty sharp in person and doesn't have any immediately noticeable pixelation. Huawei's EMUI also offers plenty of customization so you can change screen temperature and color saturation to your preferences. Viewing angles and visibility in a brightly lit room were good.. Under the hood, the View 10 is packing plenty of power. The battery is a plentiful 3,750mAh cell, which should provide lots of juice. For reference, the 3,300mAh OnePlus 5T lasted for 7 hours and 10 minutes of LTE video streaming, so we expect the View 10 will deliver similar performance.. The phone has a Kirin 970 processor clocked at 2.4GHz. That's the same powerful chipset as the Mate 10 Pro, and similar to the OnePlus 5T. In the time I spent with the View 10, performance seemed smooth, with no noticeable stuttering or slowdowns. The phone also has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a microSD card slot that can work with cards up to 256GB or a second SIM.. See How We Test Cell Phones. There's a dual 16-megapixel/20-megapixel rear setup that allows for a bokeh mode, improved low-light performance, and true black-and-white shots. The most notable feature is that the NPU is able to help the camera recognize scenes and adjust settings to take the best shot. For instance, it may tweak ISO or white balance if you're taking a picture of text in a book versus trying to capture something in low light. If you're snapping something bright like fruit, color saturation may be dialed up.. The cameras also support 4K recording at 30fps , but don't appear to have optical image stabilization. The front camera is a 13-megapixel sensor that took clear shots.. Left to right: Honor 7X, Honor View 10. LTE bands include 1/3/5/7/8/30/38/40/41, but again there is no confirmation if the phone will be compatible with US carriers. It also has dual-band Wi-Fi and NFC for mobile payments, but still has Bluetooth 4.2, rather than the newer 5.0 standard. It does support aptX, though, allowing for higher-quality Bluetooth transmissions with compatible devices.. The View 10 runs Huawei's newest EMUI 8.0 on Android Oreo , which means a revamped interface with app icons, settings, and features that are different from what you find on stock Android. Most notably, the phone benefits from the AI intelligence. Like the Mate 10 Pro, it will automatically manage memory better, recognize pictures, and offer suggestions such as prompting you to enable eye-care mode late at night. It should also smooth out performance by identifying the apps you're likely to run at a given time and setting the stage for you to use them.. The phone also supports face unlocking, similar to the Apple iPhone X. It doesn't have the same IR sensors in the front, however, so we'll have to wait and see how reliable it is.. Overall, the Honor View 10 looks like a solid phone, on par with the Mate 10 Pro. Depending on the price, it'll likely compete against the OnePlus 5T, which shares a similar design and feature set, but lacks the dedicated NPU. We don't have details on the View 10's price or availability yet, but if it launches in the US we'll be putting the phone through its paces and updating this story to a full review.. Bottom Line: The Huawei Honor View 10 is an attractive phone with a tall and narrow build, dual camera sensors, and a dedicated AI processor for performance that gets better over time..

It also boasts solid specs with a dual-camera system, a snappy Kirin 970 processor, and tons of storage. We don't know how much it costs, or if it will be available in the US, but we did get to spend some time with an early model and have some initial impressions.. The Honor View 10 has a smooth aluminum unibody design available in black or navy. I noticed the black model seems to easily pick up fingerprints and smudges, but it's nice and grippy compared with the slick Honor 8 .. It may not have a glass back like the Galaxy S8 or iPhone X, but the View 10 follows the other prevailing trend of 18:9 screen ratios by adopting a tall-and-narrow body with most of the front dominated by a 6-inch screen with a narrow bezel on the top and bottom. Beneath the screen is a home button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor.. Left to right: Honor 7X, Honor View 10. The phone measures 6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 6.1 ounces, similar to the OnePlus 5T (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.7 ounces) and Honor 7X (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.8 ounces). The narrow form factor makes it fairly easy to hold and use with one hand since you can reach across the screen without issue.. The screen itself is a 6-inch, 2,560 by 1,080 panel, which works out to 403 pixels per inch (ppi). That's a bit low compared with the Quad HD panel on the Samsung Galaxy S8 (570ppi), though it basically matches the OnePlus 5T (401ppi). It looks plenty sharp in person and doesn't have any immediately noticeable pixelation. Huawei's EMUI also offers plenty of customization so you can change screen temperature and color saturation to your preferences. Viewing angles and visibility in a brightly lit room were good.. Under the hood, the View 10 is packing plenty of power. The battery is a plentiful 3,750mAh cell, which should provide lots of juice. For reference, the 3,300mAh OnePlus 5T lasted for 7 hours and 10 minutes of LTE video streaming, so we expect the View 10 will deliver similar performance.. The phone has a Kirin 970 processor clocked at 2.4GHz. That's the same powerful chipset as the Mate 10 Pro, and similar to the OnePlus 5T. In the time I spent with the View 10, performance seemed smooth, with no noticeable stuttering or slowdowns. The phone also has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a microSD card slot that can work with cards up to 256GB or a second SIM.. See How We Test Cell Phones. There's a dual 16-megapixel/20-megapixel rear setup that allows for a bokeh mode, improved low-light performance, and true black-and-white shots. The most notable feature is that the NPU is able to help the camera recognize scenes and adjust settings to take the best shot. For instance, it may tweak ISO or white balance if you're taking a picture of text in a book versus trying to capture something in low light. If you're snapping something bright like fruit, color saturation may be dialed up.. The cameras also support 4K recording at 30fps , but don't appear to have optical image stabilization. The front camera is a 13-megapixel sensor that took clear shots.. Left to right: Honor 7X, Honor View 10. LTE bands include 1/3/5/7/8/30/38/40/41, but again there is no confirmation if the phone will be compatible with US carriers. It also has dual-band Wi-Fi and NFC for mobile payments, but still has Bluetooth 4.2, rather than the newer 5.0 standard. It does support aptX, though, allowing for higher-quality Bluetooth transmissions with compatible devices.. The View 10 runs Huawei's newest EMUI 8.0 on Android Oreo , which means a revamped interface with app icons, settings, and features that are different from what you find on stock Android. Most notably, the phone benefits from the AI intelligence. Like the Mate 10 Pro, it will automatically manage memory better, recognize pictures, and offer suggestions such as prompting you to enable eye-care mode late at night. It should also smooth out performance by identifying the apps you're likely to run at a given time and setting the stage for you to use them.. The phone also supports face unlocking, similar to the Apple iPhone X. It doesn't have the same IR sensors in the front, however, so we'll have to wait and see how reliable it is.. Overall, the Honor View 10 looks like a solid phone, on par with the Mate 10 Pro. Depending on the price, it'll likely compete against the OnePlus 5T, which shares a similar design and feature set, but lacks the dedicated NPU. We don't have details on the View 10's price or availability yet, but if it launches in the US we'll be putting the phone through its paces and updating this story to a full review.. Bottom Line: The Huawei Honor View 10 is an attractive phone with a tall and narrow build, dual camera sensors, and a dedicated AI processor for performance that gets better over time..

Huawei Honor View 10 Preview: a Combo of the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro. Honor 7X: a more affordable option. Huawei has just revealed two devices in London which aim to offer a special ratio of hardware specifications and price that is hard to resist: the Honor View 10 (also known as Honor V10 in China) and the Honor 7X. To be precise, the Honor View 10 will start at 499 euros in Europe (the 64 GB/4 GB memory model), while Honor 7X will start at just 200 euros.. Interestingly enough, the more powerful Honor View 10 is in fact a combo of features which we saw on the recently revealed Huawei super flagship duo: Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro. This is a 6-inch device with an 18:9 screen ratio, based on the octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 970 chipset with Mali-G72 MP12 graphics and 4 or 6 GB of RAM and 64 or 128 GB of memory storage. The phone comes with Android OS 8.0 (Oreo) and EMUI 8.0 user interface. These features are the same on both Mate models.. The Honor View 10’s display has a 1080 x 2160-pixel resolution, just like Mate 10 Pro, but an IPS screen is used this time, not AMOLED, which matches what the Mate 10 offers. Similarly, the Home key with the fingerprint reader is located below the screen, just like on Mate 10. The elegance of the exterior finish is far better than on both Mate versions. This device is only 7 millimeters thick, which is a good millimeter less than the chunky Mate devices. Additionally, the selfie camera on Honor View 10 has 13 megapixels (not ‘just’ 8 megapixels) with an equally good F/2.0 lens. Honor View 10 also has a 3.5-mm audio jack, which is a rather important asset.. Still, certain features do not follow in the steps of the Mate 10 and 10 Pro in order to make the price more enticing. The Honor View 10 has a rear-facing dual camera with a primary 16-mega pixel sensor in color with an F/1.8 lens, while the secondary camera has a 20-mega pixel black and white sensor. There is no Leica branding and there are no gimmicks that come with it on Mate models, but this does not mean that Honor’s camera is less interesting or that it cannot take better photographs. Similarly, the Honor View 10 does not have a 4000 mAh battery, but ‘just’ a 3750 mAh power source – remember, it is a millimeter slimmer. It comes in blue and black and is not water-resistant like Mate 10 Pro or even resilient to splashes like Mate 10.. When everything is taken into account, the Honor View 10 is a typical flagship device for a younger audience, which wants a reliable device that will last a long time, handle frequent use and adjust to the modern way we use phones: which boils down to a lot of scrolling.. Apart from the aluminum finish, which is reminiscent of Huawei’s P10 series, the phone offers a premium feel, while the outstanding hardware platform and initial synthetic benchmark results prove that Honor View 10 offers a shade more than direct rivals in the same price range – OnePlus 5T and Opp F5.. Since this is meant to be a “trendy” and youthful device compared to the big league models, the Honor View 10 is short of a few premium details (like the fact it is not water resistant or that it does not have faster camera lenses). It does not come as a surprise that Huawei already revealed an option which will soon be available – creating animojis that are more powerful than what Apple has to offer on the iPhone X. To be precise, the Huawei animojis will be able to mimic tongue movements, something that Apple’s flagship cannot do. It may not sound like much, perhaps it may even be funny, but this trend has (un)expectedly become popular after the reveal of the iPhone X and is important to many of the targeted users. This is why the Honor View 10 is the most rounded phone for young users … and those who are young inside.. The Honor 7X offers a highly attractive price-to-performance ratio for those who think 500 euros is too much to pay for a mid-range phone. This is surely the cheapest 16:9 display phone, also with a 1080 x 2160-pixel resolution and a diagonal just under 5.93 inches. The phone comes with the octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 659 chip and Mali-T832 MP2 graphics and 3 or 4 GB of RAM and 32 or 64 GB of memory storage. Software-wise, it is equipped with Android OS 7.0 (Nougat) and EMUI 5.1 user interface. The dual camera is still here, only the primary camera has 16 megapixels, while the secondary has 2 megapixels.. The selfie-camera has 8 megapixels, while the battery has the capacity of 3340 mAh. This phone also comes with an aluminum finish, a dual-SIM version and a 3.5-mm audio jack.. The product will be available on the European and American market this December..

OnePlus 5T: Which midranger reigns supreme?. Huawei Honor View 10 review offset. The Honor 7X wasn’t the only great phone to come out of Honor’s factories recently — the Honor View 10 is aiming to blow the midrange market apart, with a Kirin 970 processor , a hefty dual-sensor camera, and a massive bezel-less screen. But here be dragons; the OnePlus 5T is still fresh on the scene, and it’s eager to prove its dominance. How do these two amazing midrangers stack up against each other? We took a look to find out.. Honor View 10 OnePlus 5T Size 157 x 75 x 7mm (6.18 x 2.95 x 0.28 inches) 156.1 x 75 x 7.3mm (6.15 x 2.95 x 0.29 inches) Weight 172 grams (6.07 ounces) 162 grams (5.71 ounces) Screen 5.99-inch IPS LCD display 6.01-inch AMOLED display Resolution 2160 x 1080 pixels (403 pixels-per-inch) 2160 x 1080 pixels (401 pixels-per-inch) OS EMUI 8.0 (over Android 8.0 Oreo) Android 7.1.1 Nougat Storage 128GB 64GB, 128GB MicroSD card slot Yes, up to 256GB No NFC support Yes Yes Processor HiSilicon Kirin 970 Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 RAM 6GB 6GB, 8GB Connectivity GSM / HSPA / LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Camera Dual sensor 16MP & 20MP rear, 13MP front Dual sensor 16MP &20MP rear, 16MP front Video 2160p @ 30 fps 2160p @ 30 fps, 1080p @ 30/60 fps, 720p @ 30/120 fps Bluetooth Yes, Bluetooth 4.2 Yes, Bluetooth 5.0 Audio Headphone jack Headphone jack Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass Water resistant No No Battery 3,750mAh 3,300mAh Charging port USB-C USB-C Marketplace Google Play Store Google Play Store Colors Navy Blue, Midnight Black Midnight Black Availability HiHonor OnePlus Price TBC $500 DT review Hands-on review 4.5 out of 5 stars. The new Kirin 970 processor runs the Honor View 10 — the same processor we saw in the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. It’s an impressive piece of kit, capable of beating the Snapdragon 835 in the Galaxy S8, though it falls short of beating the same chip in the OnePlus 5T benchmarks. It’s a good reminder that benchmarks aren’t always indicative of real-world performance, but it’s still enough to tell us the Honor View 10 and the OnePlus 5T are neck-and-neck in processing power.. The Honor View 10 does have a few more tricks up its sleeve with the addition of the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) in the Kirin 970 which allows for on-device artificial intelligence, rather than the cloud-based processing that requires data to be sent away from the device to be processed. It’s a neat little addition that works hard behind the scenes to increase efficiency and allow for greater performance.. We see the two devices are fairly similar in terms of storage, with 128GB of storage being the top line of each device. The OnePlus 5T does also offer a 64GB model, which is something we don’t see on the global version of the View 10 (though the Chinese version will include a 64GB option), but the Honor device does include the option of a MicroSD card — something the OnePlus 5T lacks.. The OnePlus 5T does take some points back again with a larger amount of available RAM — but as we’ve always said, the impact of RAM on smartphone performance is arguable , and the 6GB on the Honor View 10 is unlikely to disappoint.. The Honor View 10 also doesn’t include the latest. Bluetooth 5.0 , instead settling for Bluetooth 4.2. The 5T has taken full advantage of the increased strength and range that 5.0 offers, but it’s not as big a sin as it could be, since both devices include a headphone jack. The View 10 also includes an infrared port, so you can use this device as a TV remote if the need strikes you. It’s a feature that’s been missing from recent phones, so it’s nice that Honor has included it here.. This is a tough category to call. The processors are neck and neck, the storage is similarly equal, and the amounts of RAM are close enough as to be essentially the same. For our money though, we wager the addition of the NPU on the Kirin 970, the option to add a MicroSD card, and the cool little infrared port trumps the additional RAM and improved Bluetooth on the OnePlus 5T.. 2017 has been the year many manufacturers threw away their bezels, and embraced a glorious bezel-free future. Both of these devices have gone for a bezel-less, edge-to-edge design, with displays that are roughly 6 inches in size. The OnePlus 5T has a slight edge with a 6.01-inch screen compared to the 5.99-inch screen on the Honor View 10, but the difference is negligible. Both are also rocking 18:9 aspect ratios with resolutions of 2160 x 1080 pixels. They’re gorgeous, crisp, and beg your eyes to take just one more look. The OnePlus 5T, however, gains an edge with the deep blacks and vibrant colors only an AMOLED screen can provide. That’s no slur on the View 10; it’s gorgeous, but an IPS LCD is always going to struggle to match an OLED panel.. Camera Battery life and charging Software Price and availability Overall winner: Honor View 10 OnePlus 5T vs. Pixel 2: Battle of the Android superstars. We’re seeing similar overall designs here too, thanks to the exceedingly large screens on both. Both have slim bezels around the sides, and a small forehead and chin at the top and bottom of the screen. There’s a small difference in the fingerprint scanner placement — the OnePlus 5T has its on the rear of the device, while the Honor View 10 squeezes its underneath the screen. It’s a small difference, but it could be enough to sway you if you prefer one over the other.. Both devices have metal casings, so there’s no wireless charging here. The metal on the OnePlus 5T is rather slippery, so we recommend a case to add some grip. We haven’t had enough time to really evaluate the metal on the Honor View 10 yet, but it feels good in the hand. Neither device has any water resistance, which is a shame, but we can forgive them, given the flagship specs and low prices.. It’s another tough one to decide, but the day is won by the AMOLED display on the OnePlus 5T.. Huawei Honor View 10 review camera app. The reduction of bezels isn’t the only trend these phones are chasing. Both the View 10 and the OnePlus 5T are bang up to date with the inclusion of twin-sensor cameras. Curiously, the two camera systems are rather similar; the OnePlus 5T pairs a 16-megapixel and a 20-megapixel lens, with a standard f/1.7 lens replacing the telephoto lens from the OnePlus 5. The replacement of the telephoto obviously means a loss of optical zoom, but OnePlus says the new lens should improve low-light shots. The Honor View 10 also packs a 16-megapixel and a 20-megapixel lens together, with one lens producing entirely monochrome shots, helping to enhance low-light performance.. But which is better? It’s a tough call to make. The OnePlus 5T’s camera is good, but it’s not spectacular by any means. We haven’t had a chance to play with the Honor View 10’s camera properly yet, but based on the excellent Honor 7X’s camera , and sister-company Huawei placing extremely highly on DxOMark with the Mate 10 Pro , we’re willing to bet the View 10 has a brilliant camera. Still, we’re hesitant to award the prize based purely on speculation.. Both cameras record up to 2160p at 30 frames per second (fps), but if you’re a fan of further camera trickery, then you’ll probably enjoy the OnePlus 5T’s ability to shoot slow-motion videos at 120 fps at 720p. The OnePlus 5T also bags a stronger front-facing camera, with a 16-megapixel selfie shooter compared to the 13-megapixel camera on the Honor View 10. Still, it’s a small difference, and it doesn’t make up for what we’re willing to bet will be a strong main camera on the View 10.. For now we’re judging this a tie, pending results on the View 10’s camera. We’ll change this if the results are strongly one way or the other.. oneplus 5 tips and tricks dash charge. Both phones need a pretty hefty battery to help fuel those huge 6-inch screens, and thankfully, they’re not a bad size. The OnePlus 5T has a 3,330mAh battery that saw us through roughly a day and a half; OnePlus has said 60 percent battery power should be enough for the day, and that seems fairly accurate. The Honor View 10 weighs in with a bigger battery, packing a 3,750mAh monster inside its slim profile. If that doesn’t last the day you should really wonder why.. But even if your usage is heavier than usual for whatever reason (check out our guide on saving battery ), then the fast-charging methods packed into each of these devices should see you right. OnePlus’s proprietary Dash Charge is consistently impressive, capable of charging from empty to 60 percent in 30 minutes, and from there to full in less than 90 minutes. However, the Huawei SuperCharge in the View 10 is just as impressive, capable of taking the battery to 58 percent from empty in 30 minutes — and that’s on a significantly larger battery.. It’s hard to judge this one without some time to see how the Honor View 10 deals with everyday life, but since they’re matched on fast-charging, the Honor View 10 sneaks the win for the extra capacity.. Huawei Honor View 10 review front screen. Android is an extremely varied ecosystem, and there aren’t many phones that better exhibit that than these two. The OnePlus 5T runs a near-stock Android 7.1.1 Nougat experience, cunningly disguised as OxygenOS. It’s extremely similar to stock Android, with a few additions like an ambient display, double-tap to wake, and support for various gestures — if you fancy giving the iPhone X experience a try. Still, it’s a shame the latest Android 8.0 Oreo isn’t installed. But OnePlus has promised Oreo will be coming in the first quarter of 2018.. The Honor View 10 runs Huawei’s Emotion UI (EMUI) software — EMUI 8.0, to be exact. It’s the latest version of EMUI, a heavily re-skinned version of Android 8.0 Oreo. Lovers of stock Android won’t like it, but everyone else should cope just fine. There are some issues with EMUI 8.0, as we noted in our Huawei Mate 10 Pro review , but all-in-all, it’s a strong OS, with plenty of extra fun additions like gestures, and the latest additions to Android, like the notification dots on apps that show when you’ve received messages.. We enjoy stock Android as much as the next person — but you can’t argue with a more updated version of Android, even if it is hidden behind EMUI. The Honor View 10 wins here.. The OnePlus 5T is currently available from the OnePlus website , with prices starting from $500 for 64GB of storage and 6GB of RAM. Upgrading to 128GB of internal storage and 8GB of RAM will set you back a further $60, raising the costs to $560. The phone comes unlocked, so you can put it on whichever network you prefer; word to the wise though, the phone has limited support on Verizon and Sprint, so this is one to skip if you’re locked into either of those networks.. The Honor View 10 is set to be released January 8 in the United Kingdom, and while we haven’t seen U.S. pricing for it yet, the U.K. model is supposedly around 450 British pounds, so there’s a small chance the U.S. price could be lower than the OnePlus 5T. The same warning applies here as to the OnePlus 5T though; there’s no support for Verizon or Sprint with the View 10, so skip this phone if you’re stuck with either of those two.. Without definite pricing for the View 10, this is too close to judge. That said, it would probably be too close to call anyway. It’s been a close, tough fight, with quite a few categories ending in a tie. It’s a compliment to both devices that they’re able to put up such a good fight against each other, and both are fantastic midrange devices with flagship-level specs that you should be proud to own. But for us, the Honor View 10 is coming out as the slightly stronger device. It might not have the AMOLED display or the staggering amounts of RAM the OnePlus 5T has going for it, but it is running the latest version of Android, has the slight edge on the specs sheet, and we’re willing to bet it’ll have the stronger camera in tests. But that’s not to say the 5T is a bad choice; either phone would be the perfect complement to the new year, and will be a worthy companion until your next upgrade..

The Honor View 10 is Honor ‘s latest mid-range device, and it comes with the power to challenge flagship devices thanks to the Kirin 970 processor, 6GB of RAM, and a strong camera suite. But can Honor’s View 10 stand up against one of the big boys? Specifically, how does it stand against the might of sister company Huawei’s Mate 10 Pro? We took a look to find out..

Some mid-range devices today are known as flagship-killers, because they deliver the same specifications as premium smartphones, but for hundreds of dollars less. That is what we’re seeing in a specs comparison between the Honor View 10 and the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. Both handsets come with the same Kirin 970 , with the same neural processing unit (NPU) that allows for on-device artificial intelligence processing — so it’s fair to assume these devices will be more or less equal. While we expect there to be a slight difference in the benchmarks between devices, it’s not likely to be a difference users will notice day to day.. There is a slight difference between the available storage and RAM on each device; while each has 128GB of storage and 6GB on the top models, the Mate 10 Pro also has a 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM model, making that version an objectively less powerful machine than the View 10. Still, it is debatable how much of an impact RAM has on smartphone performance , so we’re not letting that dictate too much in this competition. The Mate 10 Pro does lose out again, though, with the lack of a MicroSD card slot to expand available memory — the View 10 can use a MicroSD card to boost available storage by up to 256GB.. Neither the Honor View 10 or the Huawei Mate 10 Pro has taken advantage of the increased strength and range of Bluetooth 5.0 — they are both stuck with Bluetooth 4.2. This is less of an issue for the View 10, as it includes a headphone jack — but the Mate 10 Pro doesn’t include a 3.5mm port and therefore needs to rely on Bluetooth for most audio, so the lack of the most recent version of Bluetooth is a disappointment.. As is becoming usual with mid-range devices, the View 10 is packing the same power as the Mate 10 Pro — but it brings users more utility, thanks to the inclusion of a MicroSD slot and the headphone jack. The Honor View 10 takes this.. best huawei mate 10 pro cases. Looking back at 2017, it seems obvious this year will be seen as the advent of the bezel-less smartphone. Both the Honor View 10 and the Huawei Mate 10 Pro are up to date with the latest tech trends, and that includes the massive edge-to-edge displays that take up most of the front of each phone. They’re stunning; both devices have slim bezels around the edges of the screen. and a small forehead and chin at the top and bottom. You will find the fingerprint scanner, which is also the home button, on the chin of the View 10, while that scanner is hidden on the back of the Mate 10 Pro.. But enough of that, on to the displays. They’re both 6 inches in size (the View 10 is actually 5.99 inches, but who’s counting), and packing an 18:9 aspect ratio and 2,160 x 1,080-pixel resolution. They’re both sharp, bright displays, but the Mate 10 Pro has an edge with the vivid colors and deep blacks afforded by its HDR AMOLED display. The IPS LCD on the View 10 just can’t match the peerless quality of the OLED panel, and while the Honor phone still looks amazing, it’s here we see the Mate 10 Pro’s higher price really start to show.. Camera Battery life and charging Software Price and availability Overall winner: Huawei Mate 10 Pro Honor View 10 vs. OnePlus 5T: Which midranger reigns supreme? Honor View 10: Everything you need to know. While both phones feature similar bezel-less designs on the front, flip them over and you’ll see a difference. We likened the Mate 10 Pro to a supercar , and it’s easy to see why. Its smooth metal unibody is covered with heat-treated glass, and the camera lenses have a distinctive and stylish strip highlighting their position. Take a look at the Honor View 10, and it’s just a little … boring. The metal unibody isn’t unattractive, but it’s bland compared to the Mate 10 Pro.. In terms of durability, you will definitely be wanting a case for the Mate 10 Pro. There’s something about glass-backed phones that stirs our anxiety, and a protective case can help ease that feeling. The View 10 is less of an issue, thanks to the lack of glass on the back, but you still probably want to keep it protected. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro also has IP67 water-resistance, so it will survive a dip in the toilet where the Honor View 10 might not — but we don’t recommend testing that.. The View 10 might be able to keep up with the Huawei Mate 10 Pro’s power, but it struggles to match the gorgeous design and AMOLED display on the flagship device. The Mate 10 Pro takes it.. Huawei Honor View 10 review back top. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro comes with an impressive camera; by pairing with Leica, Huawei has given users a camera comprised of a 12-megapixel lens and a 20-megapixel monochrome lens, both with an aperture of f/1.6. It’s capable of two-times optical zoom and the blurred bokeh effect, and using the monochrome lens alone creates some amazing black-and-white photos, without the need for a filter. It’s a fantastic camera, and it produces some stunning images. The NPU really comes into its own here, suggesting camera modes depending on what you’re looking at. We found it reliable, and it often picked the best mode for the occasion.. We haven’t had a real chance to play with the Honor View 10’s camera yet, and while Honor’s pedigree is good — the Honor 7X has one of the best budget phone cameras around — we’re struggling to see how it will match the Mate 10 Pro’s superior snapper. It will have the same NPU smarts, but the dual-sensor 16-megapixel and 20-megapixel camera most likely won’t deliver the spectacular results we’ve seen from the Leica lens on the Huawei phone. Don’t get us wrong — we’re expecting it to be on par with the OnePlus 5T’s excellent camera — but we can’t see it beating the Mate 10 Pro.. Around the front of each device, you will find your front-facing camera. The Mate 10 Pro has a respectable 8-megapixel lens, but the View 10 beats that with a 13-megapixel lens. If you’re an avid selfie-shooter then that might sway you toward the Honor device, but for everyone else, they’re both good front-facing snappers that take solid shots. Video capabilities swing the other way — both can shoot 2160p video at 30 fps but the Huawei Mate 10 Pro has the advantage here, being capable of shooting at a full 60 fps at 1080p as well.. While we’re expecting the Honor View 10 to do very well in our camera tests, we can’t reasonably expect it to match a camera that is second only to the Pixel 2 in image quality. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro takes this.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro Desktop mode. Both of these devices are packing hefty batteries. We have not had a chance to test the 3,750mAh battery in the Honor View 10, but based on that large capacity, we’re going to assume it should make it easily through the day — shooting for 1.5 days shouldn’t be outside the realms of possibility. However, the 4,000mAh monster inside the Huawei Mate 10 Pro regularly lasted an incredible two days between charges , making it one of the lengthiest lasting flagship smartphones out there.. Neither manufacturer has moved into wireless charging yet, but both devices are using Huawei’s SuperCharge technology for fast charging. That pretty much puts them on a par in terms of charging speed; both should be able to charge from empty to full in about 90 minutes.. We’re expecting the Honor View 10 to do extremely well in our battery tests, but the extra capacity on the Mate 10 Pro speaks volumes. The two-day battery capacity wins every time.. Huawei Honor View 10 review front screen. Both of these handsets are running Huawei’s proprietary Emotion UI 8.0 ( EMUI ) over the latest version of Android, Android 8.0 Oreo. It’s a heavily reskinned version of Android, and it’s likely to be a culture shock to anyone who is used to stock Android. Older versions of EMUI received scorn for looking too much like iOS, but as time (and updates) have passed, EMUI has slowly evolved into its own entity. It is smooth and responsive, though new users may struggle with the layout of some of the options. Still, it’s easy to remove most of the pre-installed apps, and the additions are generally useful, once you get used to the operating system.. Since both phones are running the same operating system, it’s too hard to pick between them. The View 10 does have a better face unlock system than the Mate 10 Pro, but we don’t feel it’s worth adding extra points on for something that can be easily patched in later. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro is currently available internationally, though a U.S. release has not yet been confirmed. Rumors point to an official January launch for the phone , as well as a potential deal with AT&T. If you really can’t wait, then Amazon currently has stock you can grab. As is usual for Huawei phones, there is no support for the CDMA band, so Sprint and Verizon customers will have to look at other phones.. The Honor View 10 is primed to launch January 8 in the U.K., with prices starting at 449 pounds. pricing for it yet, but we’d wager you’re looking at around the $500 mark, like the OnePlus 5T. release date is similarly unknown, but you can sign up to be informed over at Honor’s website. Like the Mate 10 Pro, the Honor View 10 lacks banding for Verizon and Sprint, so you have to avoid this phone if you’re locked in with those big guys.. Availability is all over the place for Huawei and Honor phones in the U.S. right now, so we’re going to judge this on value. If you’re looking for flagship power, and you’re not too fussed about the frills, then the Honor View 10 represents an incredible bargain — and despite what we said about the design, it’s not bad looking, really. We’re giving this one to the Honor View 10 — it’s just such a bargain.. It’s not much of a David versus Goliath when the little guy loses. But we have to be real here — even though the Honor View 10 packs flagship specs and a bezel-less design into a mid-range package, and even though it lands a good few hard punches on the Huawei phone, it still loses out overall. The strong showing from the Huawei Mate 10 Pro’s AMOLED display, the exceptional camera, and the gorgeous supercar-like looks just take the Mate 10 Pro out of the View 10’s league. Pound for pound, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is simply the better phone.. But that’s not to say you shouldn’t buy the Honor View 10. or don’t like the idea of putting down almost $1,000 for a phone (and you’re not alone), then the Honor View 10 is likely to be the phone for you. It’s an extremely strong looking mid-range phone and it could easily be the mid-range smartphone of early 2018.. The Weinstein Company to file for bankruptcy.

Our Huawei Honor View 10 review sheds light on what Huawei is describing as the ‘World’s first AI phone’. Enhancing almost everything that you do on a smartphone, the experience is set to be like no other.. The Huawei Honor View 10 will arrive in the UK on January 8th 2018 and can be bought on a contract or for (a surprisingly low price of) £449 as handset only.. We will cover more on what the AI chip actually does as we go through this Huawei Honor View 10 review. However, first we will highlight its specifications and get the technical bit out of the way.. Fill in the form and be the first to know when the Huawei Honor View 10 is released .. The AI chip is a Huawei made Kirin 970 AI octa-core 2.36GHz processor with 6GB RAM. The chip has an NPU (neural-network processing unit) that uses deep learning based upon the user’s behaviour.. New: Huawei Mate 10 review. By doing this, the chip allocates resources by anticipating your behaviour. The result is 25x the performance of a non-AI chip with 1/50 of the power consumption. Needless to say, whatever you want to do, will be instant and extremely power efficient.. The 5.99” bezel-less FullView Display has a high screen-to-body ratio and the longer and thinner 18:9 screen aspect ratio. To make the most of the longer display, we get FHD+ resolution, which adds extra rows of pixels to give us 2160 x 1080 pixels.. The display makes use of the first AI function with Intelligent Display Rotation. Here the AI aspect sees the user, so if you lay down on your side, the display won’t annoyingly change to a landscape view. Furthermore, with Intelligent Screen On, the display does not turn off while you are looking at it.. Even though the Huawei Honor View 10 has a bigger battery, compared to the Apple iPhone X and the Samsung Galaxy S8 , it is much thinner than both of these smartphones.. The metal body is only 6.97mm thick and weighs in at 172g. The Honor View 10 will be available in Navy Blue or Midnight Black.. Facial Unlock will debut on the Huawei Honor View 10 (to be offered in an over the air software update) and this will recognise your face as soon as you raise the phone in your hand. When notifications are received, the phone will only show the notification snippet if your face has been recognised, in order to stop unwanted snooping.. While we are waiting for the OTA update and Facial Unlock, we can use the fingerprint sensor, which is embedded under the front glass.. There is a very generous 128GB internal memory for transferring your content over onto. Should you need to boost the memory in the future, then there is a 256GB microSD card slot.. The Huawei Honor View 10 runs Huawei’s EMUI 8 user interface, which enhances the Android 8.0 Oreo operating system. Huawei gems include AI Smart Tips, landscape view dual-column scrolling and an AI Accelerated Translator for immediate photo and menu translation.. EMUI 8 also adds a twist to multitasking with Smart Split Screen. If you are, for example, watching a video and you receive a notification, then the phone will pro-actively switch to a split screen, so that you can reply or deal with your notification.. An Intelligent Game Suite also forms part of the package. With the Uninterrupted Gaming function, you can lock the navigation keys to avoid accidental key presses.. The Huawei Honor View 10 has a dual camera consisting of a 20MP monochrome lens and a 16MP RGB lens. For ultimate performance, there are two independent Image Signal Processors.. The AI component takes smartphone photography to a new level with real-time scene and object recognition. The cameras recognise ten different types of objects and scenes including food , text, sunsets, dogs, cats, snow, flowers, blue sky and beaches. The intelligent photography algorithms then adjusts the settings for you, giving you pro results without the need of a pro mode.. The AI element is so fast that it can recognise 33 images per second, which compares to 16 images per second on the iPhone X and just 2 images per second on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. AI Motion Detection configures the camera and predicts how objects will move in the scene and AI Zoom ensures clarity with intelligent detail enhancement.. The 13MP selfie camera has an AI powered Portrait Mode with semantic segmentation. This gives sharper portrait edges and more accurate background blur. You can even separate two people in group selfies for an accurate bokeh effect.. With the AI Portrait Mode you can change the background of your selfie so that you can appear on social media in London for breakfast and then appear in New York for tea.. The 3,750mAh battery performs extremely well giving up to 160 hours of music playback or up to 5.5 hours of gaming, 21 hours of internet browsing, 19 hours of video playback or up to 23 hours of talk time.. Smart Power Management learns from your usage behaviors to ensure the phone gets through the day. You can take control yourself and switch between Normal, Gaming and Power Saving modes.. With Honor SuperCharge you can get back to 50% charge in just 30 minutes.. Next: BlackBerry Motion review. Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 16GB black. Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 32GB white.

The Huawei Honor View 10 is an attractive phone with a tall and narrow build, dual camera sensors, and a dedicated AI processor for performance that gets better over time. Smartphones LG V30 Apple iPhone X OnePlus 5T Huawei Mate 10 ... Huawei is going all in on machine learning. The company's Honor View 10 is its latest phone to boast a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU), letting it run AI computations with greater efficiency than a CPU or GPU alone, similar to the Mate 10 Pro. It also boasts solid specs with a dual-camera system, a snappy Kirin 970 processor, and tons of storage. We don't know how much it costs, or if it will be available in the US, but we did get to spend some time with an early model and have some initial impressions.. The Honor View 10 has a smooth aluminum unibody design available in black or navy. I noticed the black model seems to easily pick up fingerprints and smudges, but it's nice and grippy compared with the slick Honor 8 .. It may not have a glass back like the Galaxy S8 or iPhone X, but the View 10 follows the other prevailing trend of 18:9 screen ratios by adopting a tall-and-narrow body with most of the front dominated by a 6-inch screen with a narrow bezel on the top and bottom. Beneath the screen is a home button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor.. Left to right: Honor 7X, Honor View 10. The phone measures 6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 6.1 ounces, similar to the OnePlus 5T (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.7 ounces) and Honor 7X (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.8 ounces). The narrow form factor makes it fairly easy to hold and use with one hand since you can reach across the screen without issue.. The screen itself is a 6-inch, 2,560 by 1,080 panel, which works out to 403 pixels per inch (ppi). That's a bit low compared with the Quad HD panel on the Samsung Galaxy S8 (570ppi), though it basically matches the OnePlus 5T (401ppi). It looks plenty sharp in person and doesn't have any immediately noticeable pixelation. Huawei's EMUI also offers plenty of customization so you can change screen temperature and color saturation to your preferences. Viewing angles and visibility in a brightly lit room were good.. Under the hood, the View 10 is packing plenty of power. The battery is a plentiful 3,750mAh cell, which should provide lots of juice. For reference, the 3,300mAh OnePlus 5T lasted for 7 hours and 10 minutes of LTE video streaming, so we expect the View 10 will deliver similar performance.. The phone has a Kirin 970 processor clocked at 2.4GHz. That's the same powerful chipset as the Mate 10 Pro, and similar to the OnePlus 5T. In the time I spent with the View 10, performance seemed smooth, with no noticeable stuttering or slowdowns. The phone also has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a microSD card slot that can work with cards up to 256GB or a second SIM.. See How We Test Cell Phones. There's a dual 16-megapixel/20-megapixel rear setup that allows for a bokeh mode, improved low-light performance, and true black-and-white shots. The most notable feature is that the NPU is able to help the camera recognize scenes and adjust settings to take the best shot. For instance, it may tweak ISO or white balance if you're taking a picture of text in a book versus trying to capture something in low light. If you're snapping something bright like fruit, color saturation may be dialed up.. The cameras also support 4K recording at 30fps , but don't appear to have optical image stabilization. The front camera is a 13-megapixel sensor that took clear shots.. Left to right: Honor 7X, Honor View 10. LTE bands include 1/3/5/7/8/30/38/40/41, but again there is no confirmation if the phone will be compatible with US carriers. It also has dual-band Wi-Fi and NFC for mobile payments, but still has Bluetooth 4.2, rather than the newer 5.0 standard. It does support aptX, though, allowing for higher-quality Bluetooth transmissions with compatible devices.. The View 10 runs Huawei's newest EMUI 8.0 on Android Oreo , which means a revamped interface with app icons, settings, and features that are different from what you find on stock Android. Most notably, the phone benefits from the AI intelligence. Like the Mate 10 Pro, it will automatically manage memory better, recognize pictures, and offer suggestions such as prompting you to enable eye-care mode late at night. It should also smooth out performance by identifying the apps you're likely to run at a given time and setting the stage for you to use them.. The phone also supports face unlocking, similar to the Apple iPhone X. It doesn't have the same IR sensors in the front, however, so we'll have to wait and see how reliable it is.. Overall, the Honor View 10 looks like a solid phone, on par with the Mate 10 Pro. Depending on the price, it'll likely compete against the OnePlus 5T, which shares a similar design and feature set, but lacks the dedicated NPU. We don't have details on the View 10's price or availability yet, but if it launches in the US we'll be putting the phone through its paces and updating this story to a full review.. Bottom Line: The Huawei Honor View 10 is an attractive phone with a tall and narrow build, dual camera sensors, and a dedicated AI processor for performance that gets better over time..
