You need to first go to "settings -> security -> turn on widgets". Then go to the phone lock screen and swipe left -> you should see the option to add widgets.. Not that many readily preinstalled apps can be added as widgets (e.g. on my phone I could see calendar and Twitter only), but 3rd party apps where the "widget" option has been included should also appear here. 4 pages/widgets can be added at a time.. 5 people were helped by this reply.

Microsoft Launches Nokia X2 Dual SIM Smartphone. by Brett Howse on June 24, 2014 6:30 PM EST. 3 MP Fixed Focus 1/5 inch. 5 MP Auto Focus 1/4 inch. 5 MP Auto Focus 1/4 inch. 1500 mAh 3.7 V (5.55 Wh). 1800 mAh 3.8 V (6.84 Wh). 2000 mAh 3.7 V (7.4 Wh). Today Microsoft announced a second iteration of the Nokia X family of low end smartphones they first announced at Mobile World Congress earlier this year. The new device is the Nokia X2 Dual SIM, and is a slightly higher specification device than the original Nokia X device announced in February.. First, the display is slightly improved with the addition of Nokia’s ClearBlack polarization technology which Brian Klug covered in his review of the Lumia 900. ClearBlack helps with blacks as well as outdoor viewing by using polarization and several layers to reduce reflections on the display. It can make an mediocre display look OK, and a good display look great, at least in my experience. This ClearBlack technology is outfitted onto the 4.3” 800x480 resolution display of the new X2.. The original Nokia X was based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4, and the new device bumps it up to a current generation dual-core Snapdragon 200. In addition, the X2 trumps both the original X and the larger XL devices with 1 GB of RAM, however it keeps the same amount of storage as the other devices in the line with a small 4 GB but does support expansion with up to 32 GB of microSD.. The camera is also bumped up from the X which had a 3 MP fixed focus camera. The X2 has a 5 MP autofocus model with f/2.7 and a LED flash. Camera size is 1/4 inch so it’s unlikely this camera will be very effective in dim scenarios, but with the flash it should at least take some sort of picture. There is also a Front Facing Camera - a bonus over the original X, but it is only VGA resolution.. On the software side, the Nokia platform has been revved to “Nokia X software platform 2.0” with this release which offers enhancements to the user interface such as a Windows Phone-esque alphabetical app list, a new home key, and a pull-down notification screen. While an update is scheduled for existing devices, the software platform 2.0 will not be available on the older X and XL models due to hardware limitations of those devices.. As for the actual device, it’s going to be available in Black, White, Yellow, Green, Orange, and Grey with an “Inner Glow” outer clear coat. The device goes on sale in July with an expected MSRP of €99 (around $135 USD).. We weren’t really sure what was going to happen to the X Line with the Microsoft acquisition, but at least one more device has now launched so obviously there is some internal support for AOSP with Microsoft services. It’s likely this device was already in the pipeline prior to the acquisition, so we’ll have to wait and see if any other Android based devices find their way out of Microsoft. It will be interesting to see if we ever get any sales numbers on the X line vs the low end Windows Phone line (Lumia 520, 630, etc) because all of the X line phones have come in at or around the same price as the Lumias. We’ll have to wait and see at the next financial call if any of the numbers are broken out, but I wouldn’t count on it..

Don't really see why one would buy these phones instead of Moto E, same SOC, same spec, higher res(960X540) and you get all the google services & playstore instead of having to use MS services and limited app selection. Moto E is undercuts Nokia X2 in price($129 vs $150). Penti - Tuesday, June 24, 2014 - link. Or just Moto G so you get better battery life than the low end Lumia's and so on. With Amazon having their fork, and BB getting ready to have Amazon app store on the Android Runtime Microsoft's market for these is just getting more squeezed, doesn't make any sense for developers to release apps through the Nokia Store and the market share aren't exactly those that would hack and mess around like the current Blackberry 10-users. Yet they need something like this. hodakaracer96 - Tuesday, June 24, 2014 - link. This is forked android not windows phone... Penti - Tuesday, June 24, 2014 - link. Because Windows Phone apps are released through the Nokia Store... But a Moto G is more value than Lumia 520, 630, 635 as well as non forked and better performing than the X2. Moto E goes for pretty much the same money as X2 and L520. A low end phone is a low end phone. hodakaracer96 - Tuesday, June 24, 2014 - link. Ah just reread your comment I misunderstood. Yes I agree that the X2 is going nowhere. Especially if it loses the Nokia name (powerful brand outside of US) to some form of MS branding. Penti - Wednesday, June 25, 2014 - link. Won't loose the branding in the phones lifetime (probably pretty short) as they can use it until 31 dec 2015 at least. Nobody really cares about Nokia here in Europe any more, the company as a phone maker is already dead and buried. It's not that much more popular than in the US. Everything essentially stopped and fell apart quickly with the new direction. Microsoft swept in and killed Symbian, MeeGo, Meltemi etc by forbidding development as part of the collaboration, killing any European competition as a result, hardware was replaced by whatever Qualcomm parts Microsoft supported and two app processor vendors shut their doors for the mobile market as a result. That also killed their camera work in practice. It's more that it is what Microsoft needs. They need to have a presence everywhere and have their services reach this market too. Other will have more success forking Android though. New Chinese vendors already sell more smartphones than MS does globally, by essentially selling forked Android in China. NA has players like Amazon and Blackberry as said (latter has a runtime on top of the OS rather than Android), reaching those as a developer is easier. We will see how long Hungary or whatever Microsoft Mobile plant that churns these out will keep at it. The finns won't exactly love this new Microsoft. Thousands of engineers and assembly workers lost their jobs, most got other good jobs but obviously the country lost an identity and the network part simply operates as NSN for the most part and the mapping business don't advertise as an Nokia company any more but rather pushes their fairly new Here brand and name. Microsoft got stuck with Series 40/Asha that should have been faced out :). sherlockwing - Tuesday, June 24, 2014 - link. correction: they actually have the same MSRP. But the agrument still stands: if you don't have to pay more to get a better screen and google services, why get stuck with only MS apps?. Salt - Saturday, July 05, 2014 - link. Moto E is not even close to this phone, there's more in life than just praying for Google; Microsoft / Nokia wants a piece of the Pie, that doesn't make them better or worst than Google. Now Moto E don't even have a Led Flash for photos, doesn't have a front camera, and that is a huge fail, Skype on a phone is quite nice to have you know. Also this days Google is not develloping the OS very much, what they want to do is just sell their products, advertising!. Penti - Tuesday, June 24, 2014 - link. AOSP 4.3 Level 18 based according to docs. No update to 4.3 for the older devices. HardwareDufus - Tuesday, June 24, 2014 - link. DSDA on this low end device.

Nokia X2 Dual SIM Reviews. Nokia X2 Dual Sim is a 7 GB+ of free storage available to you on OneDrive, Built with a 5 MP camera, Dual-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 processor.. 4.3 inches, WVGA (800 x 480). Please feel free to post your review on this product.. This phone is very very useful to me, because the battery is longer life than other phones. While I doing multi task, the phone is still smooth to use. Nokia X2 is the most phone in my entire life. If you neee a phone like this, you need to buy it in the mall. X2 is not powered by Google +. I didn't connect in the Clash of Clans and other games. For example: clash of clans need a google acc and google+ to connect it into the other device. I don't know the problem, but I need one solution to fix it.. Everything is under control , my mails , message , social media and calling conversation, Nokia X2 Dual sim is very useful for me , I have two sim cards and I need to use one phone only and this one is very suit in my need, fast processor, speedy. I choose this X2 touchscreen because of the Android version, I dont like windows its difficult to use..This phone is responsive when it comes also in transferring files through bluetooth , easy to configure other devices, safe and sound phone , durable , high quality and resolution... This Phone do simple task smoothly and I love it.This phone is good despite it's price.. This is not a great phone but a good phone with good display and good design despite it's thickness.The Camera is also good and the User Interface is so smooth.. The downside it is not the android we used to know but it can still play games and apps from android,while playing games like asphalt 8,the phone doesn't lag it is smooth.. Asphalt 8,Benjie Bananas,Temple Run,Subway Surfer,Angry Birds(Rio and Seasons),Angry Gran Run,Dumb Ways To Die,Plants Vs Zombies 2,JetPack Joyride,5 Nights at freddy's 2(Aptoide),Zombie Tsunami(1mobbile),Candy Crush Saga,Fruit Ninja,Flappy Bird,Don't tap the white tiles(1mobile),Plagues.Inc(1mobile). Much Better Than The Original Nokia X. Better Display,Camera,Processor and Design,The Nokia X2 is a good device to own.The Design is great a typical Nokia Design but Feels good in the hand and the way it looks is good,You can find other colors.The Camera is also good but not great,It is good at low light and taking videos And the Phone is just so responsive no lag and whatsoever well it may have lag in a few days but the movie stays responsive.. The Phone also support your favorite gaming apps like asphalt 8,Jet Pack Joyride,Minecraft without any lag and thats why I Love this Phone,Battery life is also good.. The Downside?It's not typically Android it's Nokia's own version of Android,It doesn't have that much apps as android do but you can always download other markets like Aptoide and 1mobile to download some favorite apps but some apps can't support it,That means your limited and but again it still have you most favorite apps like facebook,Instagram etc.. Overall The Phone is great.It's No-Brainer to buy this phone,It's still a good phone the downside is that you cannot download that much apps and not an android phone BUT a good camera,display,processor,ram and Design and also smooth UI with nice animation and good for playing games this is still a nice phoen better than Noia X,X+,XL.:). Nokia X2 isn't the android phone that we know and love but a Nokia's Version of Android,Whether you like or not this is the platform used in the phone.Is the OS good well, The OS is not that great some apps aren't working In this phone,That's my downside of the phone.. In The Good side.The Phone is just so smooth it doesn't lag that much,The Camera is great maybe the main feature cause so many employees in different stor said it has a great camera and playing games are smooth too.. I give this phone a 7.5/10. Not An Android Phone but still a great Phone. The Phone has so many great things a Good Camera,Great For Playing Games a great screen the design is also nice and unique by the way and the camera is just amazing but the store of downloading games are horrible you can't download that much app as android do.The phone's OS is based on nokia's version is not android but still has some similarities as a smartphone but it isn't android at all.. Nagamit ko sya for almost 4months na walang screen protector or phone protector para masubukan talaga ang tibay nya at dalawang beses na syang nalaglag. Ang nagandahan ko dito subrang smooth dalhin ... Nokia Mobile Phones > Nokia Lumia > Lumia 520. Sooo cute! It's one of my best Phone. Nokia Mobile Phones > 130 (2017). Parang nostalgic sa akin ang phone na ito hindi sa design kundi sa mga games na naka install dito kasi naman snake xenzia ang nilalaro ko dito mas pianganda pa nila yung mga display sa screen nito ...

You can root the phone and install google play store and services. You just need a pc or laptop.

Note: Scores are assigned in comparison to similarly priced products. Nokia launched the X2 as a successor the Nokia X, which has met with a tepid response. Compared to the X, a lot has been changed in this phone, both in software and hardware. The screen size which is bumped up to 4.3 inches now. The resolution is the same  800x480 pixels but the processor is now a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 chipset with a 1.2GHz dual-core Cortex-A7 CPU and 1GB of RAM. Also, a Home button has been added next to the Back button. 4GB of internal storage can be expanded upto 32GB by a microSD card. The battery is 1800mAh and claims to give around 4 hours of internet browsing on cellular data, which doesnt sound mighty. At 150 grams, the phone is heavier than the Nokia X which only weighed 129 grams. The phone comes with a 5MP camera which has both autofocus and flash. It also has a front facing camera for video calling. Nokia has tweaked their Nokia X Software Platform that features Fastlane  a feature that allows you to switch between your favourite apps, has gotten better. It also has HERE maps, MixRadio and gives you 1 month free worldwide Skype calls. Keeping up with Nokias fixation for colours, the phone will be available in glossy green, orange black, yellow and white variants.. Video About Nokia X2 Dual SIM. Nokia X2 Dual SIM Price History.

Got this as a gift for my husband. He never leaves its side and is glued to it most of the time! The back camera is really nice and gives you crystal-clear photos, although the front camera is not that high-def. The flash in the camera is perfect and enhances the picture quality without making the pictures look super-pasty-white. The battery life is pretty good and it's an easy to use phone.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good Product. There are a huge number of phones in this range but I chose this one because of its atrong features. I am happy with this product. Here are some +ves and -ves +ves 1.Camera quality is quite good. Brand is Nokia so I can hope long lasting quality and support for this set unlike Micromax Gionee Lava etc in which one or the other problem occurs in later years...Overall this phone is good for those who dont change phones frequently. 4.The main spark of this phone is its ability to run all the Android apps. Unlike Nokia's other sets which are based on Pathetic Windows OS this one saves the day. 5.Easy to Use Interface -ves 1. Screen size is small; for those who are fan of Big Screen phones this phone will disppoint u because of its 4.5" screen size.I a much lower price and same config u can get Micromax Unite 2 with 5" screen but thats "Micromax" and in Microsoft(Nokia) phone u may buy Lumia 535 but thats totally Windows Based...so This is Nokia X2 is preferable there. Overall I am happy as I have my separate parameters for judgement.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Size is Easy to Handle and Sleeky Glassy Look 3. Hello Every one Here is very very simple Review for NOKIA X2 - Dual Sim mobile phone in X Series 1. Size is Easy to Handle and Sleeky Glassy Look 3. Speed Superb : 1 GB Ram 4. Semi Android/ Windows: Looks awesome by downloading Nova Launcher 6. Aptoide Market helpfull for downloading Apps for this phone 7. Music, Video, Internet Speediness Pretty Good 8. Battery best in the range (Avg 1 Day) 10. Strong fight to all other phones in the market in the range Allthe above for just below 8K......worthy pick from The Nokia Fans. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars great product. battery life lightyears better than the much .... battery life lightyears better than the much hyped galaxy series.... easily lasts a full day with data connection all through.. works much much smoother than the samsung platform which often hangs. very thin and the black version looks like a costly phone. the only bad thing is that the in-built ring tones are horribly pathetic.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars A few points to mention. Whatsapp works just like in any other android phone. But you have to download the apk file from whatsapp website and install manually. All free apps from play store can be installed. Use the website http://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/ to download the apk files. If you already have purchased any paid app from play store that cannot be installed. Google maps can be installed and works well except that you cannot sign in to your google account to see your saved places if you have any. Any one of the two sims can be used on 3G network. Camera sound can be turned off. The vibration while pressing the home & back buttons cannot be disabled. Very heavy for its screen size. Looks like a premium device, especially the black one, in my opinion. Considering the specs and price, overall performance is excellent. No need to worry about that.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars It is a very good phone but lack og Google playstore and Google play .... It is a very good phone but lack og Google playstore and Google play services is the biggest disadvantage...and many apps require google play services..some of the major apps are Youtube,Snapchat,Dubsmash,Gmail,G-Maps :) But the phone is fats..doesnt hang..battery life is pretty good and doesnt heat up too much..display is not really appreciable...camera is good but in low light performance is not so good but with other camera apps it works well...and yes its sound recording is the worst thing about this phone :( But value for money :). Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent phone from Nokia. Excellent phone from Nokia, now Microsoft. A polished version of Nokia X with good specifications and performance. Price of @ Rs 7,000 is really value for money. Ergonomic as well has a relative broad width. Too bad that they did not continue the series at this price point.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars simply best. Thanks for the quick delivery by amazon.. No cons to mark as important.. All in this phone are superb. But I expected camera to be little more. Simply I waited a long time to get this phone.. I am excited to own a Nokia brand. The phone comes with updated 2.1.0.12 platform.. U no need to update .. But I expect Microsoft to launch Nokia x3 with better specifications than x2.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?.
