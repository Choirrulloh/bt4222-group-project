Mobiles / HTC Mobile Phones / HTC Desire 820G+ Dual SIM Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 598 Launch Date in India: 27 June, 2015 Compare. HTC Desire 820G+ Dual SIM Description. Front firing loudspeaker HTC Blinkfeed. The Taiwanese handset manufacturer, HTC has successfully managed to tap the Indian handset market with its mid-range Desire 82X series of smartphones. Its Desire 820G Plus is another impressive handset that comes with an attractive price tag as well as good specifications. This model is an upgraded dual-SIM variant of the Desire 820G launched earlier in India.. The design of the Desire 820 G Plus is typical to that of the Desire series and looks quite attractive. It comes with glossy plastic rear panel and colour highlights around the edges as well as camera for accentuation. There is a flap on the left side of the device that accommodates the dual-SIM as well the microSD card. On the right edge the brand has positioned the power button and the volume rocker. All in all the design of the Desire 820 G Plus is quite practical as well as easy on eyes.. HTC devices are known for their stunning displays and the Desire 820G Plus is no exception as it comes with a brilliant 5.5-inch display for the viewing pleasure of its users. The resolution of the handset is pegged at 1280 x 720 pixels, which is suitable for all kind of multimedia and gaming experience. Moreover, the display of the device is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 layer.. HTC is offering the smartphone with Android 4.4 Kitkat operating system out of the box, which is quite easy to use. However, if you are not comfortable with the Kitkat user interface, it is also upgradeable to Android 5.0 Lollipop opertaing system. To top it all, the Sense UI that runs on top of the Android operating system comes with its own enhancements and upgrades over stock Android, which includes the like of HTC Blinkfeed and others.. The performance and smoothness of the user interface is further enhanced by the Octa-core processor clocked at 1.3 GHz. Further, the 1 GB RAM smoothens out the slightest lag and stutter that one might experience while using this device. Under the rear panel of this handset is a powerful 2600 mAh battery pack that lasts long enough on a full charge.. Desire 820G Plus is a handset primarily targeted at users who are avid photographers and rely on their smartphones for photography. The rear panel of the handset houses a powerful 13 MP camera that is a delight for any newbie photographer. On the other hand, the 8 MP camera on the front of the device can capture some brilliant selfies.. Considering that the device is placed in mid-range segment of smartphones, the competition is quite fierce. One can consider Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML, which comes with almost similar specifications with a massive 4 GB of RAM. Another device to consider in this price range is the Micromax Canvas Sliver 5, which happens to be the thinnest and lightest smartphone in the market as of now.. HTC has managed to churn out a golden goose with its Desire 820 smartphone and banking on the popularity of the handset, release a number of handset in the same series. The Desire 820G Plus is a part of the same series and boasts of similar specifications and looks. If you do not want to own a device that looks pretty common, Desire 820G Plus is not for you. However, if you admire serious performance and specifications go for the handset without any second thoughts.. HTC Desire 820G+ Dual SIM Price in India. 10,499 .00.

More about update htc desire 820g lollipop marshmallow. Rishabh Tatiraju Dec 25, 2015, 11:45 PM. I guess the Desire 820G+ still has a KitKat firmware. You can, however, always install a custom firmware, but the Desire 820G+ has a Mediatek chipset, and Mediatek is known for its anti-developer environment. I guess you have to stick with KitKat only.

The only ROM I could find on XDA is a stock 4.4.2 kitkat RUU file. http://www.fix-battery-drain.xyz/2015/12/htc-desire-820g+-dual-sim-7267.html what about this link.it says it is from xda developers. © 2018 Purch All Rights Reserved..

HTC Desire 820G+ Rating by MobileDokan. HTC Desire 820G+ also known as HTC Desire 820G+ dual SIM is a mid low budget smartphone with some cool features and fine design. 8 Megapixel front camera (supports full HD video recording) can be considered its main specialty. Primary cam is pretty good as well with 13 MP resolution, autofocus, HDR etc. Octa-core processor will provide overall fast performance. But the big issue we find in this smartphone is its 1 GB RAM. It can slow down the device sometimes especially if a lot of apps are running in the background. If this phone had 1.5 or 2 GB RAM, it could be a huge success in Bangladeshi market as HTC phones got good reputation and the demand is also getting higher. Except the RAM, another drawback can be considered that there is no OTG facility. More and more users are actually considering OTG in their phones. But well, one must look at the price as well. In this price HTC Desire 820G+ is offering 5.5 inch large IPS LCD display, 16 GB ROM and relatively long battery backup as well.. User Rating: 3.12 ( 66 votes).
