Never purchase any mobile based only hardware,no matter how cheap it is,I checked Tizen app store,there is not even a search option,one of the worst app store I ever seen.Even if in future they support android app can not be as good applicable as like in android os,example is apple ios use many apps from android store but those apps not functions as good as it is in android os.
