CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. Some processors have a level 0 cache memory, which is accessed quicker than the L1, L2, L3, and so one cache memories. Besides achieving better performance, it also consumes less power.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM..

Want to give my old phone to my Personal Assistant, with the hope that if we both continue to synchronise and update BOTH phones to the account, we will they be able to maintain and update the SAME set of contacts. Really hope so, and if so Phone Copy is even better than expected!. as long as you both sync the phones against the same account, the contacts will be synchronized. The system is also able to handle collisions - changes of the same contact from both phones. You can easily review all changes on PhoneCopy website.

You can also use our Groups feature which is intended for advanced users and hidden by default (see Settings -> Groups, there is a short help for it).

Hello, we slightly changed the login screen in recent version of our application.. Now you have to check at least one local contact database to sync the contacts with. The most common choice is "Local Contacts" or simply "contacts".. If you do not see anything on the login screen, try to create one contact in the phone (choose the proper database) and repeat the login process. Sometimes app cannot detect empty contact database. PhoneCopy support team , 15/09/2014. Phone copy is syncing my gmail a/c contacts but not my local phonebook contacts from device and sim. Hi, in the application under Account & Settings button you need to select existing user and on following screen you can select or change contact database (also called provider). Then you will be able to synchronize other contact databases as well. PhoneCopy support team , 04/09/2014. Thanks for the reply but i am not able to figure out the Accounts & Settings button in android app. Sorry, exact name of the account is Advanced and Account. PhoneCopy support team , 04/09/2014. I accidentally said "yes" when phone copy asked me if I wanted to synch my SMS. I don't want to delete them from my phone but they send me over the limit for phonecopy...how do I remove the synch of just SMS?. Under Account and Settings you select Existing User and on next screen you can switch off SMS synchronization. Then you can delete SMS from the server to fit limits. PhoneCopy support team , 01/09/2014. I have been into account settings...there is no option to select existing user and I've looked everywhere for the SMS off switch...my only setting options are Basic settings Password change, Groups, Devices, Subscription, Account termination.. Would it be somewhere else? I looked under each and see nothing... Sorry, you have to user Account and Settings button in the android application. PhoneCopy support team , 02/09/2014. I recently "upgraded" to the latest version 2.4.10, but now it takes several minutes instead of less than one minute to sync. It seems to be trying to recreaate every text and contact every time I sync instead of just updating the ones that have changed. This is not really an acceptable performance degradation. The older version worked perfectly, and also told me what contacts/texts were added/deleted, which the latest version doesn't seem to do either. the thing you describe is "slow sync". This type of sync occurs only after login to app, it transfers all contacts and sms from phone and server and merges them. Because it transfers all items it takes a longer time. Next time, after the "slow sync" will be "fast sync" and it transfers only changes from phone or server, therefore it is faster then the previous one.. This behavior is the same as in previous versions of PhoneCopy.. We know that your last five synchronizations were "slow sync". But unfortunately, since you are the first user who this issue reports, currently we don't know the reason. We tested it, but for us it works on all devices.. Please, try to re-login ("Advanced & Account" > "Use existing account" > Select an account you want to sync and then press Login. First time sync will be "slow sync" and another one should be already "fast sync".. If your issue persists or not, please, send us your feedback. PhoneCopy support team , 01/09/2014. I somehow also synced that to phonecopy. So I have lost all contacts. How can I restore them from say.. visit deleted contacts page at https://www.phonecopy.com/en/contact/deleted. All removed contacts are shown, sorted by the time of deletion.. Just select all the contacts you want to restore. You can use the check-box in the upper-left corner of the list to change selection of all displayed contacts, also clicking with Shift or Ctrl works as expected.. Once all contacts are restored, sync your phone and they will be transferred back to the phone. PhoneCopy support team , 25/08/2014. I Wonder if i Upgrade to Premium, will that restore deleted and sendt sms before 30 days?. All sms stored in your account will be uploaded back to phone. 30 days limit is defined to Deleted items only and can be applied to reduce number of your deleted items. PhoneCopy support team , 20/08/2014. Forgot to say that after Upgrade, i only get error Message, and i se that there is 2 acounts With sms., can i add i now yoy only synk from espensjo. The problem that occurred was caused by the version PhoneCopy that you are currently using. The actual stable version 2.2.13 is not able to write SMS on phones with Android KitKat (4.4.x / your version is 4.4.2) because new restrictions were added in KitKat that were not in previous versions of Android. We have prepared a new beta version 2.4.9 which is ready for Android KitKat and already fully supports synchronization of SMS.. - from blue link on main screen (above the synchronize button in the PhoneCopy app). - or directly from https://www.phonecopy.com/android/download/PhoneCopy.apk. After install of the beta do relogin in app ("Advanced & Account" > "Use existing account" > Add an account you want to sync and then press Login button). PhoneCopy support team , 21/08/2014.
