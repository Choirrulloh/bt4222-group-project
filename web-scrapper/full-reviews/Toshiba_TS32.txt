This image was lost some time after publication, but you can still view it here .. It must be cellphone Monday or something because Toshiba just announced two more phones for that crazy Hong Kong market, the TS32 and the TX80 (pictured here). Honestly, the TS32 (GSM) is lacking a little in the "golly gee" department, but the TX80 (WCDMA) is the bees knees to be sure. It gets a gold star for being 3G compliant, having a 2.4-inch display and a 3.2-megapixel camera, officially tying my POS Wal-Mart digital camera in the megapixel department. Throw in some multimedia madness in the form of MP3 and AAC audio support and MPEG-4 video support and the TX80 ranks right up there with the best portable media playing cellphones.. Like I said, the TS32 is a little less exciting, featuring pretty much the same specs as the cheap-o cellphones out there... which might not be such a bad thing. Expect just a 1.3-megapixel camera and a smaller 1.9-inch display. I hear it makes phone calls, too.. When did releasing cellphones become a competitive sport?. Press Release [Toshiba via I4U News ].
