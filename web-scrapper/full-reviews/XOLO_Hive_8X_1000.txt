more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 16 GB + MicroSD. Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The Xolo Hive 8X-1000 is a powerful smartphone with Android 4.4. Its specs include 5" 720p display, 1.4 GHz octa core CPU, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM, microSD card slot, 8 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front one for video calls. Dual SIM card support is also present.. Dimensions: 5.51 x 2.76 x 0.31 inches (140 x 70 x 7.9 mm). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3). Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Smile detection, Geo tagging, Voice activation. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 11.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 14.7 days (352 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 7.60 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 13.4 days (321 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Xolo Hive 8X 1000 was recently launched with a custom Hive UI which runs on top of android, its like Zen UI of ASUS and TouchWiz UI of samsung. It comes with 1.4 Octa core processor MT6592M chipset and 8 MP rear camera and 16Gb of in built storage and all this at an affordable price point. In this review we will let you whether this phone worth the money you spend on it.. Inside the box you get the handset, MicroUSB data cable, 1AMP Universal USB Charger, Screen Protector with one preinstalled on the phone, In ear headphones with extra ear buds, warranty card etc.. Build of this Xolo Hive 8X 1000 is quite premium which makes is stand out from the crowd of other phones in its price segment. It has glass being used at the rear and front and both of these glass has protection so you wont see any scratches but fingerprint will be visible, however that can be sorted out with a flip cover which you can buy separately. In terms of design its quite different and feels lot more premium when you hold it in on your hand. The form factor of the phone is good as it gives you a nice grip with matte finish plastic on the edges but glass at the back may make it slippery for some people out there.. The rear camera is 8MP with auto focus can take very good shots in day light and low light as well, it can also record HD video from the rear camera at 720p and front camera 2 MP fixed focus which can also allow you to do a decent video chat as well and can also take some good self shots.. It has IPS LCD display with resolution of 720 x 1280 which gives you good pixel density and great viewing angles as well, sunlight visibility is also good and its readable in outdoors. in built memory of the device is 16 GB out of which around 12 GB is available to the user and it also gives you the option to install apps on SD Card. Battery backup is around one day with moderate usage, it has decently rated battery and Hive User Interface also allows a power saving mode to save the battery power.. Hive User Interface which runs on top of android is smooth and responsive and does not show any major lag during day to day usage. Hive User Interface also gives you a lot of options to customize the look and feel of the user interface by offering themes, custom icons and user interface options. It can play HD games like Frontline Commando D Day, MC4 and casual games will also run smooth on this phone.. In terms of the sound, the loudspeaker is loud but the loudest we have heard, the design of the loud speaker is also good as its placed on the bottom so if you place the device flat on the surface while watching the video it wont get blocked. It can play HD videos at 720p and 1080p, but for some videos you will need third party video player like MX Player to play some 1080p videos. It can be used for GPS navigation with the help of assisted GPS, it may not lock the GPS coordinates in indoors but outdoors there was not issue in GPS signal.. Xolo Hive 8X 1000 is available in the market for Rs. 13,999 and at this price its quite decent phone with custom UI which runs smoothly and without creating any issue. The camera performance of this phone was also better than what we expected. It feels slightly heavy but on the other hand also feels strong as well and build quality is good as well, the only things we faced was finger prints on the glass but that can easily go away with a. flip cover which you can buy separately..

Final Words: The XOLO 8X-1000 is Impressive!. Connect with us Facebook Google+ Instagram Twitter YouTube Like us on Facebook. Navigation About TechView Video Gadgets Startups Telcos Features. Published on October 3rd, 2014 |. Bhavishya: “Why are you still using. such an old phone (HTC One M7)? Come join us and you’ll get to use new phones every week!”. Me: “Sure, I’d love that!”. And then I got handed the XOLO 8X-1000 to review.. This was definitely some sort of initiation ritual. So I dug around the blog and found out that XOLO, an Indian smartphone brand launched in 2012, recently launched in the Middle East market. They handed the newbie a newbie device. XOLO really need to up their naming game. ‘XOLO 8X-1000’ is just too long to remember. And to top it off, my first excited tweet after joining TechView was a major disaster because I. Now you see why this just doesn’t work.. The minimalistically designed box in white comes with just the brand name in the middle and the model number in the corner. You think they’ve cheaped out on the packaging? WRONG!. What you probably can’t see are the magnets on the box-flaps. This certainly adds a premium feel to the whole package. You’ve certainly won me over with the screen protector, XOLO. But wait, there’s more! The phone comes pre-fitted with a screen protector on the front as well. For AED 899, this is definitely turning out to be delivering a bang for the buck.. With these numbers out of the way, it’s time to talk about what really matters, how the device feels in your hand. It feels light and it definitely does not feel cheap. With Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on and the back and Asahi Dragontail Glass on the front, XOLO has managed to keep the phone light and durable. As expected, a drawback of this all-glass design is that the phone is covered in fingerprint smudges within seconds of usage. of the phone are metallic, while the top and bottom seem to be rubberised plastic. The edges of the phone aren’t rounded, which takes some time to get used to. You notice this while holding the device for extended periods of time.. The dual-SIM slot is on the left side of the phone. On the right side, starting from the top, is the microSD slot, the Power button, and finally, the volume buttons. The micro-USB port and the 3.5mm headphone jack are located on the top of the device. The bottom only houses the speakers.. The 8X-1000 also features 3 capacitive buttons below the screen. I prefer capacitive buttons to the on-screen buttons that hardware manufacturers are now moving to, so this was a bonus. are just 3 dots! There’s nothing that indicates what each button does.. On my M7, the back button is on the left, but on the 8X-1000, the back button is on the right. Confusing for an Android user, and even more confusing for a new user moving from a non-Android device. because there’s no Instruction manual given in the box to get you started. WHAT DO THESE DO, XOLO?! WHAT DO THESE DO?!. Moving on, I figured out that the left button is the Menu button, the middle button is the Home button which can be long-pressed to bring up the task manager, and the right button is the Back button. Please add this tiny tidbit somewhere in the box or on the phone, XOLO, please.. In one word, the 5 inch screen can be defined as vibrant. Coming from an HTC One M7, all I can say is that the 8X-1000’s screen is definitely brighter. Turning down the brightness to minimum on both the phones and comparing them in absolute darkness, the results are remarkable. the 8X-1000 has a lower resolution that the M7.. Moving on, I had a few issues with the responsiveness of the screen. For example, while scrolling in an app, it would sometimes register the scroll as a click. I don’t know whether this was a problem with the OS or the screen itself. Overall, I was happy with the screen. Definitely worth the price you pay.. Once again, for the price you pay, the loudspeakers at the bottom of the phone are great. They don’t have any noticeable defects and you don’t really feel that they’ve cut corners in that department. The in-call sound quality was also good; not as great as the HTC One M8, obviously, but it’s pretty darn good.. While the sound quality wasn’t problematic, I did have an issue with the phone restarting after I hung up on a call. That’s definitely a software issue that needs to be investigated and fixed in a future update.. The 8X-1000 runs a skinned version of Android 4.4.2 (Kitkat) and does a pretty good job at it (read, no lags). The lock-screen is pretty innovative and informative but lacks the option of adding lock screen widgets or any sort of customisation for that matter.. The home screen looks clean, but for some reason, the icons remind me of the Nokia Asha series. Even the icons of user-installed apps are skinned with randomly colored rounded-square backgrounds, which I’m not a fan of.. But I guess that’s me being myself, and this is all just a matter of personal taste.. Using the buttons at the bottom of the screen in the app drawer, the apps can be sorted in 3 ways: alphabetically, by usage, and categorically. There is no option that lets you rearrange the icons however you want them, like in the Sense UI in HTC. I didn’t quite like the stock launcher, so I quickly downloaded and installed the Google Now Launcher. Digging in deep into the OS reveals some useful features that the XOLO team has added to Kitkat. For starters, there’s an in-built process monitor (named Profiler) that monitors the memory usage of running apps and notifies you of any apps running for long in the background.. There’s also an App Permission Manager that prompts you when an app requests the use of a certain permission.. Although I personally found the constant prompts of the Permission Manager annoying, these features are extremely helpful and aid in security and conserving battery life.. Running AnTuTu Benchmark v5.1 on the 8X-1000 yielded a score of 26,617; definitely. good compared to a score of 27,923 yielded by the HTC One M7. The 8X-1000 is better than the M7 in the RAM and CPU department, but falls behind (not by much) in the rest. The camera app in itself is clean and very easy to catch on to. The app has all the features you’d find in Kitkat. Equipped with auto-focus, the 8MP camera is much better than the one I’m using in my M7. and definitely delivers a bang for your buck. Check out the gallery below for image samples from the Front and Back Cameras. XOLO 8X-1000 Front Camera Sample 1. XOLO 8X-1000 Front Camera Sample 2. The only real gripe I have with the 8X-1000 is with the battery. That’s not to say that the 1920mAh battery isn’t enough, no sir! The battery is good enough for 4.5 hours of on-screen-time on Wifi and the screen on auto-brightness.. I don’t really get that many calls, but I did put one of my family friends on the job of really pushing the phone to its limits. The phone had to withstand the test of surviving a day in the hands of a. popular high school kid with over 200 BBM contacts with whom he has to keep in touch all day long while surfing Facebook, Instagram and Youtube, and also listening to songs. Here he is in all his glory.. There were no complaints of the phone getting hot and the phone fared brilliantly.. I’m really impressed with how much the phone delivers for the price. It’s truly a testament to how much the budget phone market has developed and how far this segment has come.. A couple of years back, all I could buy for AED 899 was a sluggish Samsung Galaxy Duos which I absolutely despise. I welcome XOLO to the Middle East market with all my heart and look forward to them giving the big guys a run for their money.. Finally, here are a few quotes from the people I showed the phone to without letting them know the price:. “This phone feels good in my hands. Loving the glass design on the back; feels premium.”. “The screen looks nice and the phone feels light. After hearing the price, they all pretty much had only one thing to say, “Wait, it’s only AED899? Dude, that’s awesome man!”..

By Tech N You , Senior Member on 15th September 2014, 08:38 PM. Hello all XDA Members and others who are viewing this thread. I finally found a way to root the IMPOSSIBLE TO ROOT MediaTek devices!. I personally used it on Xolo HIVE 8x-1000 MT6592M with 2 Gb RAM 1.4 Ghz Octa Core Processor MT6592M. Devices that won't be rootable by apps like Kingo Root, Vroot(for a certain time), Framaroot, towelroot etc can be rooted and have CWM recovery installed. Xolo HIVE 8x-1000 users can also follow this guide created by The Android Soul for picture tutorial. Note : If you're rooted but want to install CWM then follow this guide to create CWM and flash it via SP Flash Tool or Just copy the created recovery and flash it via Rashr (Download from play store). Let's get started without wasting time. Things you'll need MTK Drivers : All MTK Drivers 2014. Your Phone with USB Debugging Mode turned on in Developer Section. A video is already available link is in 1st point. First we would like to load scatter file for our device. Process in the video link in 1st point. Disconnect the phone's battery (if any) [ IN CASE OF XOLO HIVE JUST SWITCH OFF THE DEVICE THEN WAIT FOR 30 seconds and connect the device ] and then press volume up button and connect it with PC it will connect device in preloader mode. 1) We would like to have a backup of our UNROOTED stock ROM. Download MTK Droid Tools (Google it) and then use this method to backup your UNROOTED stock ROM. It is basically Read Back method from SP Flash tool Follow this video tutorial : How to backup unrooted stock ROM. Warning : Please do not continue this tutorial if your device has fake information or any kind of restriction or ubifs file system or you'll brick the device. This is a text guide for the video :. 2) After backup extract the firmware you created using MTK Droid Tools. 3)Now when you get boot.img for your device you're good to go. 4) Open MTK Droid tools with administrative privileges and make sure your phone is connected and then migrate to root,backup,recovery tab and click the option to choose boot.img from and locate your stock boot image and make a CWM recovery from it. 5) Wait for process to complete and then check recovery folder inside MTK Droid tools folder. 6) Now open SP flash tool and load the MTKXXXX_Android_scatter_txt and untick every option except for boot.img and recovery.img. Then click on both tabs and locate the modified images created by MTK Droid tools which can be found in recovery folder itself if you haven't moved them. 7) Make sure your phone isn't connected at this time and then hit download button in SP Flash Tool and then with phone's battery removed with volume up button pressed connect it to PC and then flash process will begin. After completion you'll see a green circle at that point disconnect your phone and switch it on. Don't disturb the phone until flashing completes and you see a green circle. Congratulations! You have CWM Recovery for your device without ROOT! :P. 1) Now download this zip file and flash it via CWM Recovery. Congo many will get root access now but not Xolo HIVE :P You do need to flash this zip. Users that don't get root after flashing supersu zip can also continue further. 2) Download Vroot from here and install it. 3) Connect your phone with USB Debugging on and wait till it detects your device. 4) Now click root button and voila you're rooted!. Now reboot and you'll see the superuser app Now you'll have two Superuser apps (NOT XOLO HIVE USERS) SuperSU from flash and Superuser from Vroot. Not to worry just open SuperSU and it will automatically ask to remove the other Superuser app choose that and reboot and you're done. Luckily those who don't want or find complication in SP Tool Read back method, just download the stock ROM for your device and extract boot.img from it and then follow same steps from 4th step at the beginning from where to create CWM for your device. I suggest use androidxda.com for most stock ROM's. Xolo HIVE 8x-1000 users don't Panic I have your CWM and Boot image ready :P Just download from here : Xolo HIVE Recovery.img. IF YOU WANT TO SHARE GIVE THIS LINK TO PEOPLE. Xolo HIVE users I saved your work upto step 5 from step 6 ,i.e, flashing you need to do manually. I know it's a long and complicated process but it is only method working until a new exploit is available to root the impossible mtk devices. Conisder me a donation if you can as it will help me to make more guides and apps. If you cant donate hit thanks. EDIT : I am adding Xolo MT6592 scatter file too in case you can't generate it. Remember to load scatter file uncheck all options leaving boot.img and recovery.img then flash the boot and recovery I provided ONLY XOLO HIVE USERS. I would in any means not be responsible for dead devices, bricked SD cards or any other activity that leads to damage of your device. If you know the risks still want to continue then go ahead..

Just upgraded to Premium and downloaded contacts to new android work phone. Want to give my old phone to my Personal Assistant, with the hope that if we both continue to synchronise and update BOTH phones to the account, we will they be able to maintain and update the SAME set of contacts. Really hope so, and if so Phone Copy is even better than expected!. as long as you both sync the phones against the same account, the contacts will be synchronized. The system is also able to handle collisions - changes of the same contact from both phones. You can easily review all changes on PhoneCopy website. As premium user, you can show all changes of each contact (look for the clock icon on contact edit screen).. You can also use our Groups feature which is intended for advanced users and hidden by default (see Settings -> Groups, there is a short help for it). Using that, users are able to assign only part of their data to the other phone (e.g. only business contacts, not the personal ones etc.).

PhoneCopy support team , 02/02/2015. Well, thats what I had tried.In the app it wanted me to go through one of 3 routes-gmail, Sansung or SMS.I don't know if it makes a difference? Another interesting thing was, afterwards using the the old phone I transferred the contacts using bluetooth to the Samsung. It transferred ok but now Gmail on the Samsung can',t see any emails in any of its folders. I'm sure if I delete the Gmail account and reinstall it that a lot of my contacts will disappear again!. the app gives you choices to decide which contact database you want to sync the contacts with.. Samsung is the local contacts (recommended), while Gmail is the contacts storage used by Gmail app and it may interfere with PhoneCopy synchronizations. PhoneCopy support team , 02/02/2015.

Hello, after synchronizing I find phonecopy has imported all the contacts from my gmail account, even those who consist only of an email address (captured automatically by gmail, those which appear under 'Other contacts' in gmail Contacts).. I would like to get rid of those, i.e. sync only the contacts which belong to a 'real' category.. Hello, when you synchronize with some account, all contacts from it will be transfered. In your case it was Google account, which is adding those email addresses as contacts. If you delete them, Google account will create them again.

I recently "upgraded" to the latest version 2.4.10, but now it takes several minutes instead of less than one minute to sync. It seems to be trying to recreaate every text and contact every time I sync instead of just updating the ones that have changed. This is not really an acceptable performance degradation. The older version worked perfectly, and also told me what contacts/texts were added/deleted, which the latest version doesn't seem to do either. the thing you describe is "slow sync". This type of sync occurs only after login to app, it transfers all contacts and sms from phone and server and merges them. Because it transfers all items it takes a longer time. Next time, after the "slow sync" will be "fast sync" and it transfers only changes from phone or server, therefore it is faster then the previous one.. This behavior is the same as in previous versions of PhoneCopy.. We know that your last five synchronizations were "slow sync". But unfortunately, since you are the first user who this issue reports, currently we don't know the reason. We tested it, but for us it works on all devices.. Please, try to re-login ("Advanced & Account" > "Use existing account" > Select an account you want to sync and then press Login. First time sync will be "slow sync" and another one should be already "fast sync".. If your issue persists or not, please, send us your feedback. PhoneCopy support team , 01/09/2014. I somehow also synced that to phonecopy. So I have lost all contacts. How can I restore them from say.. visit deleted contacts page at https://www.phonecopy.com/en/contact/deleted. All removed contacts are shown, sorted by the time of deletion.. Just select all the contacts you want to restore. You can use the check-box in the upper-left corner of the list to change selection of all displayed contacts, also clicking with Shift or Ctrl works as expected.. Once all contacts are restored, sync your phone and they will be transferred back to the phone. PhoneCopy support team , 25/08/2014.

The problem that occurred was caused by the version PhoneCopy that you are currently using. The actual stable version 2.2.13 is not able to write SMS on phones with Android KitKat (4.4.x / your version is 4.4.2) because new restrictions were added in KitKat that were not in previous versions of Android. We have prepared a new beta version 2.4.9 which is ready for Android KitKat and already fully supports synchronization of SMS.. - from blue link on main screen (above the synchronize button in the PhoneCopy app). - or directly from https://www.phonecopy.com/android/download/PhoneCopy.apk.

Hi everyone, i just searched the forums and blogs to find the suitable mobile for my Gaming thirst. This phone is somewhat ok and there are few drawbacks as well. Heating within 5 - 6 Mins of Game experience. High end games like NOVA 3 is not supported as promised in the XOLO website specs. Battery is not a removable type, But mentioned as a removable one. other than those issues, it is quite good to use.. with awesome specs I have bought eva. its main (rear) camera is amazing with Dual Led Flash and even front Cam has flash ;) so selfies in dark can be taken now. playing Hd games since day one also this ph. Thanx Xolo for offering us great specifications at such a low price.. I request to users Please do not buy this phone other than WSRetail seller. Because if you see features of this phone in comparison with other phone, seller not define the features of this phone. This is amazing phone, Beat Samsung Note 2 in every manner. But dont purchase this phone from Gadgetzone. Because this phone is used for 4 days.. this is XOLO 8X-1200 MODEL OR SEPARATE. I HAVE DOUBT WITH THIS PHONE.... XOLO DIDN'T LAUNCH XOLO PLAY 8X ...
