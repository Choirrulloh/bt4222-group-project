The Nokia 8 Sirocco edition is 95-percent glass. We were all over Toshiba's drop dead thin and gorgeous TG01 last year, so naturally a chance to peek at the rumored TG02 first hand was something we couldn't pass up. Very little is new here, the touchscreen technology has seen resistive swapped with capacitive, the device has become a wee bit smaller while retaining the monster 4.1-inch display, and some 3D touches have been added to the SPB Mobile Shell-skinned Windows Mobile 6.5 OS. Like its older sibling, the handset is still a thing of beauty and the 1GHz Snapdragon does make it all purr along very nicely -- and while the UI isn't really a custom one -- we like the ability to flip between pages kinda like iPhone and Android do now. All in, this is a pretty decent effort, and removing some of the pain that was the resistive display can only make the TG02 better. Follow on for a tour and a gallery of shots..

more ... more .... more ... more .... Dimensions 4.96 x 2.60 x 0.39 inches (126 x 66 x 9.9 mm). Weight 4.41 oz (125 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution 480 x 800 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. 0.25 GB RAM / 512 MB ROM. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Talk time 4.58 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time 9.4 days (225 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G) 4.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G) 9.2 days (220 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. GSM 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data HSDPA 7.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 2 Mbit/s, UMTS. Notifications Music ringtones (MP3), Vibration, Phone profiles, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC ID value: SP2-TQ5-E01 link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Toshiba counts up from TG01 - TG02 and TG03 leaked. Toshiba Windows Mobile Touch UI. The Toshiba TG01 is not out yet and already there's talk of two new entries in the TG line - TG02 and TG03. A leaked Toshiba roadmap shows the new Snapdragon-based devices for the first time. Unfortunately, the Toshiba TG02 and TG03 are hardly major upgrades to the original TG01.. The physical characteristics of Toshiba TG01, TG02 and TG03 are all identical - 129 x 70 x 9.9 mm, 4.1-inch 480 x 800 pixel screen, and they come with the same jaw-dropping 1GHz Snapdragon CPU. Both devices will have Windows Mobile 6.5 pre-installed right out of the box. Both the TG02 and TG03 will be available by Q3 2009.. There are some interesting differences though - and we wouldn't be posting this news article if it wasn't for those.. The Toshiba 2009-2010 roadmap and a couple of info slides on the TG02 and TG03. The Toshiba TG02 will be splash-resistant and it can be used with wet hands or outside in the rain. The camera is left unchanged at 3.15 megapixels, as is the GPS and HSDPA support.. The Toshiba TG03 ups the ante with a 5 megapixel camera and 5.1 audio channels support - we'd surely like to see that one implemented on a device that's 9.9mm slim.. What's interesting is that there's no mention of a GPS, could it have been traded for the beefier camera module?. The leaked slides also mention that Toshiba TG03 comes with VideoBox support, but there are quite a few things and services called VideoBox so it's not entirely clear which is it. It's obviously something that needs desktop computer transcoding software and has something to do with transferring and recording videos.. The leaked Toshiba 2009-2010 roadmap also reveals three other devices that are quite interesting as well. The Toshiba K01 and K02 both run Windows Mobile 6.5 on the same Snapdragon 1 GHz CPU as their TG siblings. The K01 is a QWERTY slider with a 4.1-inch capacitive touchscreen display, while the K02 is a clamshell with a 3.5" resistive display.. The Toshiba K02 has a secondary display and ten additional keys on its front - it's hard to tell but it may become Toshiba's Communicator. Both devices sport a 3.15 megapixel camera and HSPA.. And finally, the third device due for release in Q4 2009 is the the Toshiba L01 - it's again a Windows Mobile 6.5 device with a 1GHz CPU but it also features a 7-inch display and an optional detachable QWERTY keyboard, which somehow puts it in the MID group than something suitable for GSMArena database. The L01 also seems to have a kickstand but we can't really tell for sure.. Meet the Toshiba K01, K02 and L01. It's important to note that Windows Mobile is no guarantee for these things being phones; the L01 certainly isn't, although it sports HSPA as well.. We had a hands-on with the Toshiba TG01 at the MWC '09 and it should give you a good idea of what the two new versions will be like. Whether Toshiba will stick with their Stripes UI remains to be seen/leaked.. If the leaked roadmap is to be trusted, we should see the TG02 and TG03 in the Q4 2009 with a month or so between the two. The other three should be out and about at the end of 2009 or in the early 2010.. Toshiba to sell computer-chip business in order to save itself from bankrupcy.

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. Toshiba TG02 and QWERTY K01 pack 1GHz Snapdragon. Chris Davies - Feb 15, 2010. Toshiba have outed two new smartphones at Mobile World Congress 2010 , and as expected they follow on from their TG01 Snapdragon-based Windows Mobile handset. The Toshiba TG02 is the most obvious successor, a 9.99mm-thick handset with an expansive 4.1-inch capacitive WVGA touchscreen and a 1GHz processor; the Toshiba K01, meanwhile, has the same 1GHz processor with a 4.1-inch OLED capacitive touchscreen and a slide-out QWERTY keyboard.. The K01 is 12.9mm thick, and both devices have microSDHC slots and can be updated by up to 32GB cards. OS is Windows Mobile 6.5, and on top is a new, custom 3D UI which Toshiba reckon will make navigation more straightforward. We weren’t too convinced with the company’s first attempt, it has to be said, so we’ll be heading over to Toshiba’s stand here at MWC 2010 to take a look.. Toshiba are keeping details of availability close to their chest, so we’ll also be pestering them to find out exactly when we can see these two devices on shelves.. TOSHIBA DEBUTS NEW HANDSETS AND LEADING MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES AT MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS 2010. · Toshiba previews wide-screen TG02 entertainment phone and K01 with sliding QWERTY keyboard. · Fast 1GHz processors and wide, high-quality capacitive touchscreens on both handsets. · Toshiba’s latest laptops and its vision of multiple interacting devices demonstrated first-hand on the Toshiba stand. · New mobile technologies, including Resolution+, LCD control and VoiceTranslation showcased at Toshiba’s Innovation Hub, Hall 8, Stand 8A111. BARCELONA, 15th February, 2010 – Toshiba Information Systems (UK) Ltd, Mobile Communications Division, today debuts two new mobile handsets for the first time at Mobile World Congress 2010. Expanding Toshiba’s mobile handset range, the TG02 and K01 will offer capacitive touchscreens and fast internal processors, joining Toshiba’s highly successful TG01 Windows® phone, which launched in 2009. Toshiba’s drive to lead innovation in the mobile arena will also be showcased with the display of new mobile technologies, combined with a first-hand demonstration of its multi-screen solutions.. Two new handsets added to Toshiba’s mobile range. The TG02 builds on the super-slim form of the Toshiba TG01 Windows® phone, and is the ideal device for users who demand high-quality entertainment on the go. Sleek in design, the TG02 features a wide 10.4cm (4.1”)[i] VGA capacitive touchscreen, offering a fast, responsive user experience, while the same internal image tuning technology as used on the TG01 delivers rich, high-quality visuals in a slim (9.9mm1) and portable device – making it ideal for viewing movies and images while on the move.. A newly designed and highly-intuitive 3D menu system on the TG02 makes it easy for users to browse though the handset and access a range of entertainment features. Based on the very latest Windows Mobile® 6.5 platform, the TG02 enhances the user experience with its quick and easy operation. An internal 1GHz[ii] processor also makes the TG02 an ideal device for internet browsing, enabling users to quickly access and load websites or stream content.. Joining the TG02 at MWC is the impressive new K01 – a stylish, powerful and easy to use media device optimised for mobile messaging. Featuring a slide-out QWERTY keyboard that makes typing easy and comfortable, the K01 also offers Toshiba’s first-ever Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) capactive 10.4cm (4.1”)1 wide-screen – providing bright colour, contrast, lower power consumption and faster response times than ever before. The K01 also features super-slim design, measuring 12.9mm1 front to back, making each handset portable and stylish in equal measure.. The new user interface lets users quickly browse to their favourite features, saving time and making the mobile experience more enjoyable. The K01 also features a fast 1GHz2 processer and storage can be expanded up to 32GB[iii] using microSDHC cards, allowing users to store their favourite movies, music and games with plenty of room to spare.. New Toshiba technologies at the Innovation Hub. As well as showcasing the new additions to its mobile line-up, Toshiba will be displaying a range of new mobile technologies in a special area within the Toshiba stand called the Innovation Hub.. The Innovation Hub will display a range of software solutions developed by Toshiba to improve the mobile user experience. Visitors will be able to see a range of new technologies for the very first time, including the mobile implementation of Resolution+ image tuning technology fostered from Toshiba’s REGZA TVs. Re-developed for Toshiba mobile handsets, Resolution+ improves video playback by analysing image definition and intelligently upscaling video quality to offer a sharper, clearer and richer viewing experience.. Another key development which will be showcased at the Innovation Hub is LCD Control – a technology that ensures users can get the same high-quality images with no loss of contrast in difficult lighting conditions. For example, when using a mobile in bright sunlight, the reflection and effect on image contrast often makes using a handset for viewing videos and images difficult. LCD Control boosts contrast detail to levels that are unaffected by the bright lighting, providing a hassle-free way to check messages, write emails or even watch videos under daylight conditions.. Toshiba will also be demonstrating Voice Translation – a helpful programme that uses Toshiba’s Speech Recognition, Machine Translation and Speech Synthesis technology to translate different languages[iv], synthesize back into a voice and repeat back in real time, without the need for an internet connection. Originally developed for Toshiba notebooks, Voice Translation is an ideal tool for international business use or holidays, allowing users to communicate easily using their mobile phone, wherever they are in the world.. More Toshiba laptops and netbooks with embedded Mobile Broadband. Toshiba’s new line-up of Mobile Broadband-enabled laptops will also be showcased, including new versions of its recently announced 25.7 cm (10.1”) Toshiba mini NB300 and mini NB305 netbooks, featuring embedded Mobile Broadband modules. The availability of a mobile data connection with data rates up to 7.2 Megabit per second[v], together with an outstanding battery life of up to 11 hours and a light weight of only 1.33 kg, make these netbooks ideal as highly portable companions. In addition, Toshiba is also debuting Mobile Broadband-ready versions of the recently unveiled professional laptops targeted at small offices and companies, medium businesses and large enterprises: the Tecra M11, A11 and S11, and the ultra-slim Satellite Pro T110 and Satellite Pro T130. For consumers, Toshiba offers the Satellite T110 and Satellite T130 with embedded Mobile Broadband.. Toshiba’s multi-screen solution makes sharing media easier than ever. As well as debuting a new mobile line-up and showcasing it’s latest mobile broadband laptops and netbooks, Toshiba will also be demonstrating first-hand its vision for a world of multiple interacting devices that will allow users to share photos, music and movies across different screens at the touch of a button.. The Toshiba Media Controller (TMC) software allows users to stream content across connected multimedia devices with ease, regardless of screen size. Users can share media from their handset to a PC, notebook, or television, and vice versa across a network (whether a home network, enterprise network or WLAN), using the easy to set-up device. Toshiba is committed to offering users a connected world, where devices are used together to form a simple, effective media offering regardless of screen size..

We have to give props to Toshiba for being first on the fast-phone dancefloor with the Snapdragon -powered Toshiba TG01 , but its resistive touchscreen and clumsy user interface left it to boogie alone..

A capacitive touchscreen makes the TG02 livelier to use than its predecessor, but in our early tests, the user interface still isn't the slickest one out there. Nevertheless, there's plenty of room on the TGO2's 100mm (4.1-inch) screen and a 1GHz processor to keep it snappy..

Windows Mobile 6.5 may not be provoking all that much interest compared to rival platforms, but one device which is certainly perking up attention is the HTC Leo , aka the HTC HD2. Tipped to arrive in October, the 4.3-inch flagship smartphone's prize is its 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor; now one beta tester has released some benchmarking for the handset, and it's looking to be a real stormer. The HD2 ousted HTC's Touch HD in 3D graphics performance by around 300-percent.. Toshiba TG01 Windows Phone coming; free WM6.5 upgrade for existing owners. We weren't so keen on Toshiba's TG01 back when we reviewed the Snapdragon-based smartphone in July.

The Toshiba TG01 came out awhile back, and while it may not have been the greatest phone to release this year, it did have some promising aspects: like that huge screen and thin framework. But that didn't stop Toshiba from dropping word on the phone's successors, the TG02 and TG03 , which were pictured back in April. But now it looks like the Toshiba TG02 has made another appearance. With product announcements and launches often so far apart, there's always the risk that another company will steal your thunder.. Toshiba, though, have managed to pilot their TG01 Windows Mobile smartphone to market still wearing the "biggest screen" and "first Snapdragon" crowns.. Problem is, in doing so they've arrived well in advance of Microsoft's new mobile platform..

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Nexus 5 might soon come in red (update: more pictures). HTC One Max leaks out with Verizon badge front-and-center. Blue HTC One shell gets snapped in the non-flesh (updated). iPhone 5S with dual-LED flash, slightly bigger battery spied in blurry rumor-gram. Toshiba TG02 and TG03 shots surface. We like where this is headed. Toshiba seems poised to capitalize on its incredibly aggressive TG01 form factor, with the TG02 slated for Q4, and the TG03 for some time after that. We already got the skinny on the new handsets , along with the QWERTY-equipped K01 and K02 counter parts, and now we've got a few new shots of the TG series to keep things interesting. It's all a little low-fi at the moment, but while the TG03 looks like the most basic of renders, the TG02 shot (above) seems somewhat photographic in nature -- just think if Mr. Blurrycam had some sort of fixation for dotted lines..

Canon's AI flash moves by itself to make portraits more flattering. The motorized Speedlite 470EX-AI finds the best angle to bounce light.. 'Papers, Please' official short film recreates the game's bleak tone. Arztotzka has never been so glorious.. Lenovo's Yoga 730 is a cheaper 2-in-1 with Alexa support. The company also announced the Flex 14 at Mobile World Congress.. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. And as usual, it has a tiny, equally powerful sibling.. Sony will sell its wireless 'open-ear' buds in the US. The Xperia Ear Duo lets you hear both the outside world and your music.. © 2018 Oath Tech Network Aol Tech. ear icon eye icon text file vr.

Toshiba TG02 and K01: We hope they’re good. Toshiba has announced two new phones at the Mobile World Congress, the TG02 and the K01. First up is the TG02 and as its name suggests this is the TG01’s successsor – it even sports the same screen dimensions – 4.1-inches across – and a Snapdragon processor. Unlike the TG01 though Toshiba has elected to install a capacitive touchscreen on the TG02, for which we are truly grateful.. Next up is the Toshiba K01 (pictured). Similar to the TG02, the K01 features a whopping 4.1-inch OLED screen and a slide-out Qwerty keypad. The K01’s memory can be expanded up to 32GB with microSD cards so there’s plenty of space for storing pictures and messages.. Hopefully the TG02 and K01 will be good enough that we can forgive Toshiba for the TG01, a phone that we really wanted to like but couldn’t..
