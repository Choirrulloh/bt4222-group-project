By tushar verma | 28 Jan 2016. Lava P7 is surely a good catch with a 5 inch display screen and a 1 GB RAM. It also has a long lasting battery with a good quality rear and front camera. Available in white blue and gold colours, it is well designed and sleek which makes it so good looking. Along with that it has dual SIM availability which works well with people who carry 2 phones. By the looks of the features, it seems the phone is offering a pretty slick deal in affordable range.. Was this review helpful?

Mobiles / Lava Mobile Phones / Lava P7 Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 62 Launch Date in India: 22 January, 2016 Compare. The homegrown handset maker, Lava has delivered some really good smartphones in Indian market, which have been a raging success. Lava is known for its smartphone series called Pixel and Iris, which both contain some really good value for money devices. Now, the brand has gone ahead and launched a new device called Lava P7, which is an entry level smartphone with a trick up its sleeves. Here is a brief overview of the device, read on to know more about the handset.. For an entry level smartphone, Lava P7 has a deceiving look for a device that is so affordable, however, it is the same polycarbonate bar form factor. However, the glossy front and rear panel along with metallic finish side edges gives a premium look to the handset.. The handset maker has launched the new device with a 5-inch display dominating the front panel for multimedia lovers. This display has a resolution of 480 x 854 pixels, which looks quite sharp given the size of the display.. The user experience offered by the handset is quite enjoyable as it boasts of Android 5.1 Lollipop operating system pre-installed in it. Lava chose to keep the user interface close to stock so that its users can enjoy Lollipop OS in all its material glory.. There is a Quad-core processor driving the performance of this handset at a clock speed of 1.2 GHz, which is enough for a decent performance. This handset also comes with a RAM of 1 GB to negate lags to a large extent. However, the let down in the handset comes in form of its battery, which only has 2000 mAh of strength at its end.. There is a 5 Megapixels primary camera on the rear panel, which feels quite mediocre given the fact that there are cheaper smartphones with atleast 8 Megapixels camera. There is a 2 Megapixels front camera, which does nothing to be qualified as selfie camera.. Coming to the connectivity, Lava P7 misses out on 4G LTE but offers 3G to its users. However, there is Wi-Fi in this handset that allows users to connect to faster Internet connections. Other options include Bluetooth, microUSB and GPS.. One of the biggest disadvantages with entry level ultra cheap smartphones is that the brand cuts on specifications to offer the handset at a competitive price and Lava P7 suffers from the same. However, the USP of the handset is that Lava guarantees an Android Marshmallow update for the handset, which is a rarity at this price point. In case you are looking for a modest handset but want the latest Android experience, this could be your muse.. 3,775 .00. 3,449 .00. Extra 5% off with Axis Bank Buzz Credit Card.
