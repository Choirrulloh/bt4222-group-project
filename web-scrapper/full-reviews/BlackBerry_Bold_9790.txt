It's too small for my big fingers. I've tried to use it, but my fingers are too big for it's tiny screen, there are some advantages and disadvantages, however if you need a phone and you don't have much options it could be the right phone for you.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by njinealex Feb 27, 2013. Fast,Lightwieght,Secure,Good Storage but Relatively Poor Battery Life on BB. Coming from a 9780 to this I was disappointed at the battery life on it. Use my phone a lot and it doesn't last to bedtime without needing to plug in; even with OS 7.1. Strangely enough it's the at&t one ie with 3G bands 1,2,5 and 6 but seems to work perfectly on T-Mobile; even got the UMA to work with guidance from the crackberry forums. It is extremely slim/lightweight and as someone with larger hands I do find it a bit tricky to use/get used to. It feels flimsy in my hands compared to the more meaty 9900 or my previous handset. That said, the 1GHZ chip in this makes it fast and the 8GB storage certainly doesn't hurt. Kudos to BBRY for putting such specs in a handset this slim/lightweight. Seeing as it wasn't officially released among the national carriers in the US, finding accessories for it is not the easiest and when you do find them they tend to be more expensive than those of other more common handsets. by grndvlzboy Apr 06, 2017.

RIM made good progress towards closing the gap between its handsets and those of the competition with its BlackBerry Bold 9900. It was beautifully built, feature packed, had an improved interface and crucially had a relatively large touchscreen, but it was quite an expensive handset. Now BlackBerry is back with a new more affordable touchscreen Bold, the 9790. Sadly, in cutting the price, BlackBerry has cut quite a lot of the appeal too.. First impressions of the BlackBerry Bold 9790 are good, though. Its black-and-chrome styling looks as classy as ever and build quality is excellent despite the majority of the handset being plastic. The only cause for concern is that the curved screen is plastic rather than glass so you’ll need to buy a case to avoid it getting heavily scratched – you don’t get one in the box.. An advantage of the smaller size of this phone, and its curved edges is that it sits nicely in the hand – and it’s easy to reach all the buttons. The soft touch plastic on the removable backplate also adds to this easy-grip comfort.. Underneath the backplate is a 1,230mAh battery, the SIM slot and a microSD slot, which will take cards up to 32GB in size but doesn’t come with one installed. Instead you get 8GB of inbuilt storage, which is enough to make a start on your multimedia and app collection. Also on the back is a 5 megapixel camera with its LED flash. General ergonomics are helped by responsive, well laid-out buttons. The keyboard, for instance, stretches the full width of the phone with absolutely minimal gap at the edges, making it as spacious as possible. Above it the five navigation buttons are nice and responsive. The central of these is an optical trackpad that for the most part is unnecessary, as you can just use the touchscreen, but it’s useful for pinpointing the cursor for editing text amongst other things. In fact, it’s arguably more useful on this device than its bigger brother as the smaller screen here is more of a struggle to use for everyday navigation.. Coming back to the keyboard, it’s of the premium BlackBerry type. Each key is separate and sculpted to better fit the shape of your thumbs as they strike. This is as opposed to the cheaper BlackBerry keyboard used on the Curve range , which uses a single sheet of more rounded buttons that causes surrounding keys to flex and move as you press a key. As such the typing experience is pretty good, though the two columns of buttons on the edges take a bit of getting used to.. Both the keyboard and the navigation keys are stylishly backlit in white, which is essential for typing in the dark. We rather like the way the phone goes into standby mode shutting down the screen and keyboard back then slowly dimming the nav button backlights – it’s like something out of a sci-fi movie.. The main navigation buttons are for call answer, menu, trackpoint, back and call end/power functions. While touchscreen navigation systems have come far in recent years there’s definitely something about having a physical button to press to answer a call, or always knowing where to tap to bring up an options menu..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Single core, 1000 MHz, Marvel Tavor MG1. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 5.20 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 18.0 days (432 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 5.30 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 17.0 days (408 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback, Preset equalizer. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 800, 850, 1900, 2100 MHz. Data: HSDPA 7.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS.

The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Send a PGP key When you send a PGP key, your BlackBerry smartphone sends the public key, but doesn't send the corresponding private key. On the Home screen or in a folder, click the Options icon.. Revoke a PGP key If you revoke a PGP key, the PGP key is revoked only in the key store on your BlackBerry smartphone. Your smartphone doesn't update the revocation status on the PGP Universal Server.. When you add a PGP key, your BlackBerry smartphone uses the name that the PGP Universal Server set for the key when it generated the key. Turn off the fetch status prompt that appears when you add a PGP key to the key store 1.. Authentication Type Specify whether you must log in to the server.

Add contacts automatically when you add certificates or PGP keys to the key store You can set your BlackBerry smartphone to add a contact to your contact list using information from a certificate or PGP key in your key store. For example, if you add a coworker's public certificate to your key store, your smartphone can automatically create a contact entry with that person's name, organization, phone number, and address.. Smart cards store certificates and private keys. You can use a smart card reader to import certificates from a smart card to the key store on your BlackBerry smartphone, but you can't import private keys. As a result, private key operations such as signing and decryption use the smart card, and public key operations such as verification and encryption use the public certificates on your smartphone.. Turn off smart password entry To perform this task, you must be using a smart card and a password to unlock your BlackBerry® smartphone. You can turn off smart password entry to reduce the chance that someone might guess your smartphone password or smart card password based on the smart password filter that your smartphone applies to password fields..

A software token includes a token code that your BlackBerry smartphone regenerates periodically and a PIN. If you use a software token to log in to a VPN, the software token must be on your smartphone and the software token information that appears in the VPN profile must be correct.. About permissions and trust status for third-party applications You or your administrator can set permissions that control how third-party applications on your BlackBerry smartphone interact with the other applications on your smartphone. For example, you can control whether third-party applications can access data or the Internet, make calls, or track your location.. About direct Internet connections for third-party applications Some third-party applications that you add to your BlackBerry® smartphone might require a direct TCP or HTTP connection to the Internet. For example, a stock price application might need to connect to the Internet to retrieve the latest stock prices..

For more information, contact your administrator. • If you changed the connection type that your BlackBerry smartphone uses to connect to an LDAP-enabled server, try using the default connection type.. Service books and diagnostic reports Accept, delete, or restore a service book Your wireless service provider or administrator might send a service book to your BlackBerry smartphone over the wireless network to add an additional service or application to your smartphone.. Set a default recipient for diagnostic reports If you set the default recipient, each time that you submit a diagnostic report, your BlackBerry smartphone sends the report to that recipient. If you want to specify a recipient each time that you submit a report, don't set the default recipient..

About backing up and restoring smartphone data If you have installed the BlackBerry Desktop Software on your computer, you can back up and restore most of your BlackBerry smartphone data, including messages, organizer data, fonts, saved searches, and browser bookmarks using the BlackBerry Desktop Software.. You can only synchronize the data in a custom contact list field with a text field in the email application on your computer. For example, you can't add a contact's birthday to a custom contact list field on your BlackBerry smartphone and synchronize it with the email application on your computer, because the birthday field is a date field in the email application on your computer.. Turn on or turn off event sounds Event sounds alert you when you turn on or turn off your BlackBerry smartphone, when the battery power level is full or low, and when you connect or disconnect a USB cable or accessory to or from your smartphone..

Another day, another high-end BB7 handset. Only a lock button up top, no media buttons. Contacts need a lick of paint. BlackBerry may quietly (or perhaps not so quietly) be finessing its plans for world domination with its upcoming BBX handsets, but it's not letting the other operating system go to waste, with a stream of BB7 devices being churned out right now, among them the BlackBerry Bold 9790.. Up until now, the cock of the school has been the BlackBerry Bold 9900 , the premium BB offering that showcased the then new BB7 OS and replacing the tired Bold 9700 and 9780 lines.. We were slightly unsure why the BlackBerry Bold 9790 exists, since it's very similar in all but size to the Bold 9900 and makes it feel like RIM is over-saturating its own market here.. However, this is a ploy to 'sex up' the Bold line and make it attractive to the younger, non-business focused market - plus some people always prefer smaller designs.. At the time of writing, the BlackBerry Bold 9790 is yet to be released, but it's expected to cost around £360 in the UK or $450 SIM-free in the US on pre-order, which makes it a good £100 cheaper than the larger Bold 9900.. And yet, with a 2.45-inch touchscreen, 8GB of onboard memory, 5MP snapper (with flash), GPS, Wi-Fi, NFC, HSPA and 1GHz processor (smaller than the 9900's 1.2GHz), it's certainly not short of bells or whistles, and can competently compete with the likes of the credible Nokia E6 .. And of course, it'll be up against the Bold 9900. Which you go for may quite simply depend on whether you prefer a big smartphone or a small one (plus a few extra pennies in your pocket.). As for the BlackBerry Bold 9790's design, this baby is small. If you've held a 9700 or 9780 , then we're talking that small, although the handset also feels ever so slightly thinner. That's partly due to the tapered design we first encountered with the BlackBerry Curve 9360. The actual dimensions are 110mm x 60mm x 11.4mm.. Like the Curve 9360, we have four buttons below the screen, which are completely separate and surround a touch-sensitive trackpad. This distinguishes the BlackBerry Bold 9790 from the Bold 9900, which had four touchpads beneath its screen instead.. Indeed, the BlackBerry Bold 9790 looks almost identical to the Curve 9360, and the only thing that really sets them apart to look at is the keyboard. While the Curve 9360 uses the Curve's separate keys, the Bold 9790 employs the Bold's signature keyboard where the buttons are all crammed in together.. There's little of interest on the sides other than a volume rocker and convenience key on the right and a headphone jack on the left. The lock button is up top, while the micro USB charging and syncing port is down below.. There's a flash of silver around the sides and the back and a rear cover made of a matt rubber, which quite frankly requires a degree from Oxford, fingernails from Jurassic Park and the brute strength of Samson to pull off. Until you figure that it slides down. At 107g it's light, so you won't be worrying about putting your back out carrying the BlackBerry Bold 9790 around.. NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99.

The family was launched in 2008 with the 9000 Model. In 2009 the form factor was shrunk with the 9700 and the Tour 9630. In 2010 BlackBerry released the 9650 and 9780 refreshed with OS 6. In 2011 came the 9700 and 9788 along with the 9900/9930 series. The 9900/9930 and 9790 are touchscreen smartphones, released in August and November 2011.. The Bold family is known for its distinctive form factor ; QWERTY keyboard, typical BlackBerry messaging capabilities with a different keyboard than the Curve series. The Bold series is usually more expensive and has more expensive materials (e.g. leather, soft touch, carbon fiber, metal) than the Curve (plastic, glossy), and has higher specifications. There are two basic form factors with the Bold line: the original larger size on the 9000 and 9900 Series and the "baby bold" form factor the other models have.. 1.1 BlackBerry Bold 9700. 1.2 BlackBerry Bold 9650. 1.3 BlackBerry Bold 9780 Series. 2 BlackBerry 7 series. 2.1 BlackBerry Bold 9900/9930. 2.2 BlackBerry Bold 9790. 3.2 BlackBerry 7 series. Main article: BlackBerry Bold 9700. The BlackBerry Bold 9700 (codenamed "Onyx") is a high-end mobile phone data device (smartphone) developed by BlackBerry and released on December 18, 2009. While many things including the form factor are similar between this model and the larger models, the difference in the 9700's specifications are as follows: [1]. All the familiar pre-loaded BlackBerry applications are available on the Bold 9700, including but not limited to: WordToGo , PowerPointToGo , BrickBreaker and WordMole. The Bold 9700 also offers BlackBerry Messenger 4.7 but is upgradable to 7.1 in the BlackBerry App World. By upgrading the OS to version 6.0, a user also automatically upgrades to higher versions of applications.. The BlackBerry Bold 9650 is part of the 9600 device series which takes design cues from both its predecessor, the BlackBerry Tour 9630, as well as its GSM variant, the BlackBerry Bold 9700 & the BlackBerry Bold 9780. Changes from the Tour include built-in Wi-Fi, 512MB of onboard storage, and an optical trackpad instead of the trackball. MHz processor, and has a 3.4 MP camera available as an option. The major difference between the 9700/9780 vs the 9650 is that the 9650 is the World Phone Edition that can use CDMA & GSM networks globally; the 9700/9780 only runs on GSM networks. Sprint Nextel announced that they would be the launch carrier for the Bold 9650 shortly after the device was introduced, releasing the phone on May 23, 2010. Verizon Wireless followed closely, releasing the phone exclusively online on June 3, 2010, followed by its retail stores on June 10, 2010. It was released in Canada the week of April 27, 2010. The BlackBerry Bold 9780 is a high-end mobile phone data device (smartphone) developed by BlackBerry, released globally in November 2010. [6] On September 7, 2011 China Mobile and BlackBerry announced a variant known as the Bold 9788. The 9788 variant is identical to the 9700 except that the 9788 uses a Chinese 3G standard known as TD-SCDMA .. The Bold 9780 shares the same form factor as the 9700, and the only notable differences are an improved camera (3.2 MP vs. 5.0 MP) and double the onboard memory of the 9700 (256 MB vs. Both devices are OS 6.0 capable, with the 9780 having OS 6 already installed plus the chrome around the old bold has disappeared.. On August 3, 2011 [7] BlackBerry announced their seventh major release of BlackBerry OS. It included several major changes such as universal voice search, support for HTML5, Liquid Graphics and Near field communication. It also has many optimizations which improve web and gaming experiences as well as social network integration as well as some layout changes with some new icons. BlackBerry OS 7 comes bundled with the premium version of Documents To Go. On January 9, 2012 [8] BlackBerry announced BlackBerry OS 7.1 which allows Wi-Fi Tethering , BlackBerry Tag and UMA calling.. Sept 7, 2011 (SmarTone, 3, China Mobile, Vodafone, CSL). The BlackBerry Bold 9900/9930 (codenamed internally as "Dakota/Montana", also known as Bold Touch) is part of the 9000 device series. Introduced in August 2011, it is the first of the Bold line to provide a touchscreen. It marks a return to the form factor of the original 9000 and its popular wide-set physical keyboard. [9] It takes design cues from both its predecessor, the BlackBerry Tour 9630, as well as its GSM variant, the BlackBerry Bold 9700. The Bold 9900 was launched in Thailand at the DTAC 3G Expo on September 3–4th 2011. Soon after, many users were complaining that the phone was not 100% reliable for daily use as it often "froze" during the use of BBM (BlackBerry Messenger). The browser was also one of the main problems, as the touch was not as smooth as BlackBerry advertised. Both issues were promptly resolved through the over-the-air software releases of BBM 6.0 and BlackBerry OS 7.1, respectively. The Bold 9930 operates on both GSM and CDMA networks whereas the Bold 9900 can only function on the GSM network. However, the Bold 9900 can function in GSM bands that the 9930 cannot use. A 4G LTE version was available with select carriers eventually. Introduced on November 15, 2011, [13] the BlackBerry Bold 9790 follows the ergonomics of its predecessor, the Bold 9780, with an upgraded 1. The camera does auto focus (as compared to fixed focus of its predecessors), but can only produce VGA resolution videos.

Excluding the exclusive Porsche Design P'9981 from BlackBerry , we've now reviewed every other BlackBerry 7 Smartphone here on CrackBerry, including the BlackBerry Bold 9930 , Bold 9900 , Torch 9860 , Torch 9850 , Torch 9810 , Curve 9380 and Curve 9360 .. That's a lot of BlackBerry 7 Smartphones, and the newly available BlackBerry Bold 9790 slots into the Bold family from two different view points: you can either look at the Bold 9790 as a smaller, lower end Bold 9900 -- especially when compared to its big brother the bling'n 9900 -- or you can see at it as a straight up successor to the super popular BlackBerry Bold 9700 and Bold 9780. We loved the Bold 9700 and Bold 9780, so we view the 9790 as the next in line with the 9700 family and you really get the sense that's how RIM designed this phone. They took the 9780 and decided how to improve upon it, rather than taking the Bold 9900 and deciding how to change it up to be smaller and cheaper.. The rollout of the Bold 9790 has been interesting to see unfold. The Bold 9790 was unveiled in Indonesia to a crowd of passionate BlackBerry fans, which was followed by the launch of an official BlackBerry Store which saw HUGE lineups as Bold 9790's were promised at half price.. At the time of this review it has yet to be announced by any US-based carriers, though in Canada pretty much everybody has picked up the phone (Rogers, Telus, Bell, SaskTel, Koodoo, Virgin, etc.). The BlackBerry Bold 9790 forum has seen quite a lot of action and a lot of individuals in the US hoping the 9790 will hit their carrier sooner rather than later, so we'll have to wait and see how that unfolds.. Visit our Bold 9790 Super Page!. The Bold 9790 immediately addresses the two biggest gripes with the Bold 9900 - it has great battery life and the camera has autofocus. Thank heavens! Compared to the Bold 9700 and 9780, the 9790 packs more power into a smaller package. The Bold 9790's style may not be as luxurious as the Bold 9900, but the 9790 really comes across as a getter done work horse, which we love.. No HD video recording on a Bold in 2011? You'd think it's bullocks, but it's true. It makes us sad that RIM couldn't deliver a BlackBerry 7 Bold that offered both autofocus and HD video recording this year. And while we like the fact the 9790 has a touchscreen, due to the small-ish size of the display we didn't find ourselves touching the 9790 as much as we do the Bold 9900.. If you're looking for a BlackBerry 7 Smartphone with a front facing full physical qwerty keyboard, you have three options: the entry level BlackBerry Curve 9350/9360/9370, the flagship Bold 9930/9900, and the Bold 9790, which is positioned as a lower end Bold or simply a Bold alternative to the 9900 for those who prefer a smaller phone. Assuming you can afford it, we pretty much always recommend going Bold over Curve.. In the end, we're giving the Bold 9790 the same 9/10 rating that we gave the Bold 9900. While the Bold 9900 has slightly better specs, a better keyboard and is definitely more of a head turner (you might call her a trophy Berry of sorts), after using the Bold 9790 for a couple weeks we couldn't help but grow to love the dependable and hassle-free performance of the Bold 9790.. As for the debate of which BlackBerry 7 Bold to buy, you'll have to decide for yourself. Personally, I'm a sucker for good looks and don't mind gals that are a little on the high-maintenance side (let's hope Miss CrackBerry doesn't read this), so with this review over you just know I'll be running out to the store to pick up a white Bold 9900 to trade up to.. International Markets - In emerging markets like Indonesia, Bold is perceived as a prestige brand. Having a Bold that's a little more affordable but still a Bold will go over really well (which we definitely saw be the case at the 9790's launch). Remember, in these countries you don't really have carrier subsidy taking place, so it's critical for the outright cost of the phone to be as low as possible. Females/Small Hands - Not everybody loved the original wide body style of the original Bold 9000. Those with smaller hands simply find it to be too big. With the wide body making a return on the Bold 9900, RIM wanted to make sure they had a smaller form factor version more appealing to females, those with small hands and/or those who simply prefer a smaller phone. This by no way means that the Bold 9790 is a girly BlackBerry, it definitely is not, but based on size it may be a better fit for CrackBerry ladies than the 9900 (though I gave the Bold 9790 to Miss CrackBerry to try and she handed it back right away, preferring the look and feel of the 9900. Don't Mess with Success - The Bold 9700 and Bold 9780 were both big hits with a lot of BlackBerry users out there. RIM wanted a device to follow up with that success for those who straight out prefer the narrower Bold form factor over the wide body style. With the BlackBerry Bold 9900 hitting the market first and being positioned as the new flagship device of the BlackBerry 7 Smartphone lineup, a lot of people -- myself included -- intially questioned the need for yet another Bold.. When getting briefed on the newest Bold by the head of the Bold 9790 product team, the target markets and justification for this device became more clear:. Knowing that, I understand why Research In Motion chose to build the Bold 9790. And if you fit into any one of these target markets, the Bold 9790 may just be a no brainer device for you to run out and buy. Knowing the Bold 9790 delivers a similar BlackBerry 7 experience to other BlackBerry devices, my attention while using the phone really became focused at how it compares to other full qwerty BlackBerrys. With a toned down processor and smaller keyboard and display than the 9900, does the performance and experience feel Bold enough? And for those who love their existing Bold 9700/9780s and haven't upgraded to a 9900 yet, does the 9790 make a big enough improvement to force an upgrade now vs. waiting it out for a BlackBery 10 phone next year?. Check out the video above for a closer look at the BlackBerry Bold 9790 and how it compares to other BlackBerry 7 Smartphones.. At first glance, non-BlackBerry aficionados will likely have a tough time distinguishing the Bold 9790 from other Bold and Tour devices released over the past couple of years (exception, Bold 9900). With a trackpad in the centre and keyboard that features "smiling guitar frets," the overall look is very similar to that of the Bold 9780 and Bold 9700.. Better trained eyes will start to pick out the subtle design differences that make the Bold 9790 the newest of the bunch. The glowing ring around the optical navigation trackpad is new, as are the individual buttons to the left and right of the trackpad, though visually, these buttons arguably look more dated than the more integrated ones on previous Bolds. Keeping the device clean and modern though is the display housing, which is built into the body of the device - a big improvement over previous Bolds where you could distinctly feel and see the physical edges of the display.. Picking up the phone reveals perhaps the biggest changes from the Bold 9700/9780 though. The 9790 is quite a bit thinner in comparison, and you feel that in the hand. I never considered the Bold 9700 to be an overly thick phone, but the 9790 makes it look and feel chunky in comparison. And while not a visual change from a distance, the Bold 9790 gets a touchscreen - which does make for a big visual change once you start using the phone.The back of the Bold 9790 is very minimalistic. You won't find any faux leather or carbon fibre on this Bold. The gun metal grey battery door has a grippy soft touch rubber feel, with the BlackBerry logo embedded into it. The phone bulges out slightly at the top where the camera assembly is housed, giving a visual clue to just how hard RIM worked to make this phone as thin as possible. The battery door is one of the easiest of any to remove from any BlackBerry I've owned. A little downward sliding pressure is all you need.. The left side of the Bold 9790 is extremely clean. Like other new BlackBerry phones, there is no convenience key on the left side. And with the relocation of the microUSB port from the side of the device to the bottom, that only leaves the 3.5mm headset jack on the upper left. The right side of the phone is a little busier, with the same super thin volume up/down/mute and convenience key buttons as we have seen on other BlackBerry 7 Smartphones like the Torch 9860. At first I really hated these buttons, but they've really grown on me the past couple of months. Looking straight down on the phone from above you can barely tell they are there. My fingers can always feel them out without having to look at what I'm doing, and so far I haven't had any durability issues with these buttons even though that was a concern I had from the start. I personally still prefer the more visible and blinged out buttons on the Bold 9900, but I guess if you're not going to make them a design feature the best thing to do is minimize the heck out of them, which RIM has successfully done here.. The top of the Bold 9790 only features one hidden button, which is the centrally mounted lock button, which turns the display on and off and locks the device. As mentioned above, the bottom of the phone features the microUSB charging port. There's no charging contacts here for a charging dock, but don't fret - there is a BlackBerry Charging Stand available - it just uses the microUSB instead, which should make for a rock solid base for this phone. Looking behind the battery door reveals more of the clever NFC antenna integration as we have seen on other BlackBerry 7 Smartphone models. The battery is the same JM-1 1230mAH as is found in the Bold 9900, and the microSD slot is mounted at the top right corner above the battery. It has a slight angle to it, so unlike the Bold 9900, you can pop the card out while the battery is inserted without it ending up in a mess of a jam ( like this ).. Overall, the BlackBerry Bold 9790 looks and feels a lot more like an updated and slimmed down down Bold 9780 than it does anything like the Bold 9900. In comparison, the Bold 9900 has a much bigger footprint which brings with it a bigger keyboard and display, but that means overall it's a much bigger phone in the hand and to carry around in the pocket. Compared to the Bold 9780, a lot of the "lines" are cleaned up, especially around the display, the device is quite a bit thinner, which makes a noticeable different to both the look and feel. With such a plain battery door it's perhaps the most understated Bold of the bunch, and we're ok with that. It gives this Bold a getter done workhorse type of feeling, which we love.. Other Internals - Phone, Audio, Bluetooth, WiFi , GPS and Other Sensors. BlackBerry 7 OS on the BlackBerry Bold 9790. Perhaps the biggest differentiation between the BlackBerry Bold 9900 and Bold 9790 isn't the size or shape or appearance, but rather what's under the hood. While the BlackBerry Bold 9900, Torch 9860 and Torch 9810 are all rocking 1.2GHz processors on a Qualcomm chipset, the Bold 9790 is more akin to the BlackBerry 7 Curve line up, featuring a Marvel Tavor chipset. But while the Curves are clocked at 800MHz, the Bold 9790 is at an even 1GHz.. What matters of course isn't the spec, but the overall performance level, and so far in the speed department I have been more than pleased with the Bold 9790's performance. In everyday navigation and opening and closing of apps, etc., the 9790 is snappy. But to be honest, the BlackBerry OS experience was pretty snappy on the Bold 9700/9780 with 624MHz, so it should be fast here too.. Where the Marvel chipset seems to let things down a bit is while web browsing. While the flagship Bold 9900 has a 14.4 Mbps modem, the 9790's is 7.2Mbps. This coupled with 200MHz less power for rendering javascript once the data is pulled down does make the web browsing experience feel a little slower.. Overall though, I don't think anybody will find themselves disappointed with the performance of the Bold 9790. even if you're "downgrading" from a Bold 9900.. The Bold 9790's display features the same 480x360 resolution as the Bold 9780 and Bold 9700, but with one obviously HUGE difference - it's a touchscreen! Looking back at my BlackBerry Bold 9780 review , this is one of the things I desperately wanted to see come to this form factor of Bold, and with the 9790 RIM finally delivered it.. To be honest though, now that I have the touchscreen on the 9700 series I actually haven't found myself using it as much as I thought I would. Sometimes I tap the display to open apps, and I'm occasionally tapping within apps or swiping through photos. But for the most part I still find myself using the trackpad to get things done on the 9790. I think part of this is that I'm just so used to not having a touchscreen on this size/shape of a phone, that I just haven't retrained my brain yet. But I think part of it may also have to do with the physical size of the device and screen. The phone is so small and easy to use with one hand with the trackpad as navigation that it just seems less efficient to move my finger onto the display and start swiping so instinctively I don't. And with the overall size of the display fairly small at 2.45" (measured diagonally), there simply isn't a ton of room on the display to get your fingers comfortably working together for things like pinch to zoom. Don't get me wrong - there's still a decent amount of screen real estate (and I know the market has seen touchscreens that are smaller) and I do put the touchscreen to work a fair amount, but I'm just finding that compared to the Bold 9900 even, I find myself naturally using the touchscreen on the 9790 less. I guess what it comes down to is that on the traditional BlackBerry I could live without a touchscreen and be happy, so having it now is really a bonus, not a necessity for me, but I think it's something the consumer market demands so I'm very glad it's there.. As for the touchscreen itself, I've found it to be nicely responsive and the BlackBerry 7 Liquid Graphics look great on the high resolution color display. If you're looking for the absolute best keyboard to ever be put on a mobile device, you'll want to go for the BlackBerry Bold 9900 over the 9790. Anybody who tells you the Bold 9900's keyboard is not the best is either crazy, has never tried it, is lying or isn't that smart and shouldn't be giving advice.. That said, the Bold 9790's keyboard is still pretty darn good. I transitioned to the 9790's keyboard from the 9900, so there was a period of cursing over the keyboard being a bit too small and key stroke being a little too firm in comparison, but after a week I quit the cursing and have been very smooth on the 9790's keys ever since. The keyboard is mainly similar to the 9780's, with only some tiny differences that I can tell (the keys feels a bit softer to press on the 9790 compared to the 9780 and the bottom row buttons are a bit different).. In the year 2011 when there are a sea of big touchscreen phones on the market, you're going for a physical keyboard because you value communication above all else on your mobile device. And this keyboard plays nicely into that - you'll be able to pound out BBMs, emails, texts, tweets, status updates and whatever else you want to in no time flat, and in that gratifying fashion that only a physical keyboard can provide.. The BlackBerry Bold 9790 comes with 768MB of RAM, and features a microSD card slot so you can stick in memory cards adding up to another 32GB of storage for media, such as music, movies, files and photos. Apps are still installed onto the 768MB portion of the memory, but most "heavier" apps these days offload content onto the memory card so you can squeeze quite a few apps onto the device.. The single biggest complaint about the flagship BlackBerry Bold 9900 is its battery life. The previous generation BlackBerry Bold 9700 and Bold 9780 had amazing battery life. With the Bold 9900, RIM reduced the battery size 18% from 1500mAh to 1230mAh, and proceeded to add in a bigger display (which sucks back more juice), a higher performance chipset (which sucks back more juice), and added a steel band around the phone (which we think means the 9900's radio has to work a little harder in lower coverage areas to maintain signal, which eats up more battery when you're out and about). When in WiFi coverage the 9900's battery seems pretty solid. Get outside of WiFi and the battery definitely drops faster than any BlackBerry Bold user would like to see.. So how does the Bold 9790 stack up knowing that it has the same battery? The answer here is pretty darn well! Just to be extra harsh on battery in comparison to how I use my 9900 daily, I've been keeping WiFi off while at home and office, and under normal/moderately heavy use I'm still finding I have plenty of juice left at the end of the day. On a few nights I never plugged it into to recharge, and I still made it into early afternoon of the next day before looking to plug in. Between the smaller display, lower-performance Marvell chipset and more standard design, I don't think battery life is a concern with the Bold 9790. So if you're a 9900 owner and are feeling like you simply need more battery life in everyday use, you may want to consider swapping things up for the 9790.. When it comes to the camera on the BlackBerry Bold 9790, there is good news and there is bad news.. Let's start with the good news, which really shouldn't even be news, but thanks to the Bold 9900's lack of autofocus it is.... the BlackBerry Bold 9790 has autofocus! Yay!! Thank goodness. In my Bold 9900 review I wasn't too harsh on the lack of autofocus (apparently RIM left it out to make the 9900 super thin), but in practical use I've found the lack of autofocus to be really annoying. I take a lot of close-up photos of things like receipts, restaurant menus and wine lists, etc. and for all of these you really do need autofocus. So on that front the 9790 has it, and it works!. You can click on the photos below for some real world shots taken with the 9790's camera (resized down a bit and saved at slightly lower quality to save on file size, though visibly they should look the same). Outside on a cloudy day getting the Christmas tree the photo turned out pretty well. Indoors in low light with the camera flash on (it was too dark without) the Christmas tree all decorated turned out fairly vivid, but not super crisp. A close up of a new watch in decent lighting turned out really well. This same shot on the Bold 9900 without autofocus wasn't nearly as clear (one of these days we have to launch WatchReviews.com for wrist watches... after all, watches are mobile, right?!). And the final photo is in dark lighting at Miss CrackBerry's staff party, taken from a distance zoomed in. Overall it's decent, but similar to most mobile camera's these days - if you have good lighting and you're relatively close and hold still, you'll get a great shot. Poor lighting and shaky, not so much.. And the bad news? There is no HD Video Recording! Seriously. This makes me really a mad. A flagship "Bold" BlackBerry in 2011 **should** have HD video recording. When the standard rendering on services like youtube go HD, for mobile hardware to have it is simply not acceptable to me. I guess this is a tradeoff with the chipset they switched to or something, but whatever the reason it makes makes me mad that it lacks it. While NFC is still very much in its infancy as far as mainstream mobile applications go, like many of the other BlackBerry 7 Smartphones on the market the Bold 9790 includes NFC. Built into the battery door is the NFC antenna, which connects back to the phone via two pin connectors.. NFC use is stlll pretty limited, but Research In Motion will soon be releasing the BlackBerry Tag app which will allow BlackBerry users to put the functionality to use much sooner than later. You can check out a video demo of BlackBerry Tag in action above.. Everything else about the BlackBerry Bold 9790 I found to be pretty much status quo with other newly released BlackBerry 7 Smartphones. Voice quality was good, and speakerphone quality was good enough. Bluetooth worked with my car and a bluetooth speaker no problem (if you haven't picked up a Jawbone JAMBOX yet, I recommend it). WiFi connectivity is there and working well (no hotspot yet but maybe that'll come with a 7.1 upgrade). Other sensors include GPS, an orientation sensor (accelerometer) and digital compass (magnetometer) that allow for augmented reality applications like Wikitude, which comes preloaded on the phone. I'm an accesory junky, so I can't let a BlackBerry phone review go by without tossing in accessories into the review somewhere. We'll definitely be stocking lots of BlackBerry Bold 9790 cases and accessories in our ShopCrackBerry.com store and CrackBerry Canada stores. Yet again there is a new shape and form factor here, so other than microUSB cables, memory cards and the JM-1 battery that's used on some other BlackBerry 7 phones, you'll pretty much have to pick up things like Bold 9790 cases and cradles specifically for it. Pictured above is the Bold 9790 Charging Stand - unlike the $2,000 Porsche Design P'9981 by BlackBerry that comes with on in the box, you'll have to buy this one separately.. With the BlackBerry Bold 9900, I was completely smitten during my review, and still am. It's gorgeous, and I just love touching its keyboard and big touchscreen. I'm less infatuated with the Bold 9790, but end of the day, that's not a bad thing. When the honeymoon is over, what matters is everyday life, and the Bold 9790 proves to be a winner here through and through. Good battery life, it's extremely pocketable and portable and comfortable to use one-handed, and the things that matter are there (exception - HD video). Compared to the Bold 9780 it's a nice step up, and compared to the Bold 9900 I view it really more as a step sideways than a step down. It gains some things, it loses some things.. But overall it's another great BlackBerry Bold design in what has been a super popular line for Research In Motion.. BlackBerry 7 is an evolution of BlackBerry 6 ( see our extremely in-depth BlackBerry 6 Review ),which made a number of bug fixes to the OS and also introduced faster web browsing, the ability to customize the home screen more by managing the panels and brought forth liquid graphics for a smoother user experience.. With RIM stock taking a beating and the BlackBerry brand not doing so hot in North America these days, it's mainly the traditional BlackBerry OS that is getting the blame. BlackBerry hardware is well designed and high quality, but consumers, Wall Street and the media are looking for the next generation BlackBerry 10 OS to make the leap into modern mobile computing. The new BlackBerry 10 OS (evolved from the PlayBook's QNX-based operating system) needs to hit the market. Like the PlayBook, the UI will feel more modern, the overall operating system will be a little more intuitive and easier to use, and the app experience will be that much better.. And while RIM does need to improve on all these areas, I think it's a shame to overlook what the BlackBerry 7 OS in its current incarnation does so well. It's still by far the best communication platform on the market. As mentioned earlier in this review, in the year 2011 if you're looking at buying a phone with a keyboard that takes up half the real estate that could be used for a full touchscreen, you're basically prioritizing your mobile needs and saying I value the app of communication above all else. For some people, the trade off of a smaller screen isn't worth it. But for tens of millions of others, including myself, it is. The traditional BlackBerry OS is designed for people on the go. This is a phone and a OS that you'll put to use 200 times a day, for 10 seconds at a time, as you pull it out of your pocket, fire off a text, and put it back in your pocket and get on with your life. Yes, you can do things like play games and browse the web, but no matter what due to the smaller screen the experience is not going to be as good (even if a phone with this form factor was on BlackBerry 10) compared to a phone with a larger display.. Personally, I'm all about the no compromise mobile solution. For me, that means having a BlackBerry with a physical keyboard as my primary communication tool, rather then having another mobile device like a tablet (PlayBook, iPad, or whatever as my killing time device).. So while it's easy to throw stones at the areas where the BlackBerry OS is weaker compared to the competition -- like the app catalog and app experience -- you can't deny the power of the basic BlackBerry communication experience. Heck, it's off topic, but I want to drive the point home. The other week I was chatting to a small group of Wall Street analysts. All of them carried two mobile devices. They had their BlackBerry, which was issued by their company, and then they also had either an iPhone, iPad and a few had Android phones. All of them said that even if their company took away their work BlackBerry, they would still go out and buy one for their primary phone, as despite the annoying things that can happen on BlackBerry devices (like the occasional need for a battery pull which is thankfully very infrequent these days), there's no way they could function as effectively communication-wise with just a full touchscreen device.. So if you're a shaker or a mover, a power communicator or a heavy texter, the BlackBerry 7 OS on the Bold 9790 will more than suffice, and if you follow CrackBerry.com daily you'll discover some pretty cool apps too that help you get more out of your phone than just what ships in the box.. Art buffs will recognize the backdrop above to be that of Salvadore Dali's painting The Persistence of Memory. Personally, when I look at the melting clocks the notion that has always come to my mind is one of Time's a Wasting. With Research In Motion now saying that BlackBerry 10 Smartphones will not hit until late 2012, the company really has no time to waste and is going to be relying on BlackBerry 7 Smartphones sales in abroad and in North America to keep the revenue engine going and money flowing.. The good news with this bad news from RIM is that it makes the decision to upgrade or buy a BlackBerry 7 Smartphone a lot easier. Many CrackBerry readers have been holding off, thinking BBX gone BlackBerry 10 phones are just around the corner, coming in early 2012. Now knowing that these devices are still a ways off from hitting the market, I think it makes the decision to buy a new BlackBerry that much easier - if you appreciate BlackBerry, the time to buy is now!. As for which BlackBerry 7 Smartphone to choose, you'll have to read all our reviews and weigh in on which ones suits your priorities most. But of all the BlackBerry 7 Smartphones reviewed, I can easily say the Bold 9790 is probably the best no muss, no fuss BlackBerry delivering that traditional full keyboard experience that so many BlackBerry users love. If you spend a lot of time in WiFi coverage all day, I'd probably go for the Bold 9900 for the keyboard, bigger screen and hotter look, but if you're out and about a lot and want a nice portable phone that gets through the day with power to spare and still has that Bold badge on it, the 9790 could be the BlackBerry 7 Smartphone for you.. Finally a touchscreen Bold 9700 Series phone!. Understated looks - a nice evolution to standard BlackBerry touchscreen design. JM-1 battery delivers solid battery life - better than Bold 9900. BlackBerry 7 features are nice - voice search, digital compass, etc.. Lack of HD video recording makes us mad. The styling is maybe too understated - Bold devices should look Bold!. oh yeah, how about the fact no US carrier has announced it yet. Careers: Writer | Dev.

The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $93 Buy.

CNET también está disponible en español.. The Good Solid build quality; Combined view for email, instant messaging and SMS texts.. The Bad Small touchscreen; Dated, fiddly OS; Fewer apps than iPhone, Android or Windows Phone.. The Bottom Line The touch-Qwerty hybrid Bold 9790 won't win many new fans but if you're bonkers about BlackBerry you might fancy its svelte lines and speedy menus. For everyone else, your money's better spent on an iPhone or Android handset, where you can get apps galore.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Should I buy the BlackBerry Bold 9790?. Hold your finger on the 9790's touchscreen and it will bring up a menu of extra options. You'll struggle to view full web pages on the tiny 2.45-inch screen. The 9790 has a mini Post-it note-sized screen and a form factor that easily fits on a standard-sized yellow sticky thing. The 9790 packs a full Qwerty keyboard with angled keys to aid finger placement. Hook up your email and social services and the 9790 will show all your messages in one handy place. The 9790 does not have Adobe Flash support so lots of online videos won't play -- you'll have to console yourself with the YouTube app.. The BlackBerry Bold 9790 looks like almost all the smart phones RIM has released in recent years. It has that familiar corporate styling and the classic BlackBerry full Qwerty keyboard wrapped around the bottom of the phone's face like an alphabetic beard.. But the 9790 is relatively unusual for a BlackBerry because it's a hybrid, thanks to a small capacitive touchscreen up top. It's not the first touch-cum-Qwerty BlackBerry -- last year's Bold 9900 also packed both in -- but RIM has crammed everything into a smaller package this time around.. The 9790 is undoubtedly well built but it's expensive. SIM-free it costs around £350 , or you can pick up the handset free from £20 a month on two-year contracts.. Mobile is all about software these days and with BlackBerry OS 7 inside -- RIM's latest but dated operating system -- there's nothing to convert new users to the BlackBerry platform. Unless you're bonkers about BlackBerry, we can't really recommend getting involved with the 9790.. Another reason not to buy is the fact that RIM is planning to launch its next generation OS -- BlackBerry 10 -- in the second half of this year. There's no indication from RIM that BlackBerry 7 devices will be upgradeable to BB 10 , so it's probably worth waiting for the big platform refresh, rather than buying into the dwindling days of the old ways.. All the usual BlackBerry messaging features are on board the 9790 but RIM's platform remains fiddly to use compared to Android and Apple's iOS. And it's a country mile behind when it comes to apps.. The 9790's tiny touchscreen is fiddly -- it's not big enough to make web browsing a pleasure and if you mainly use a BlackBerry for messaging, your fingers are going to be tapping away on the physical Qwerty keyboard most of the time anyway.. On contract, the 9790's is in the same price bracket as lots of great high-end Android phones, including the ever popular Samsung Galaxy S2 and the HTC Sensation XE. Apple's latest iPhone, the 4S , is not that much more expensive either -- it's free on contract from around £30 -- making the 9790 a very tough sell to anyone other than a confirmed CrackBerry addict.. BlackBerry 7 is more user-friendly than previous versions of the BlackBerry OS as RIM has tweaked and tinkered to try and make up some of the ground it lost to Android and iOS.. One welcome addition is a faster browser -- RIM claims it's 40 per cent quicker than BlackBerry 6 OS. There are also zippier graphical transitions on the home screen. On the surface, it doesn't feel entirely like a phone from yesteryear, even if the look of the handset has barely changed.. RIM has grafted on a touch-friendly menu (pictured above) in an attempt to bypass the oft-thumbed BlackBerry key. Hold a finger on the touchscreen and it brings up a grid of options relating to the app you're using or the aspect of the OS you're viewing, or even specific content you've highlighted.. If you're highlighting text or a link, options can include 'copy' or 'open link'. When using the menu in the Twitter app, you're offered the chance to compose tweets, retweet content, reply to a tweet and more. If you're viewing a photo, this menu will let you add the image to your homescreen and send it to a contact. The touch menu can also be used to flick between open apps by hitting the 'switch apps' option. This will then bring up a grid of recently used apps in icon form -- then you simply tap on the app you want to switch to it.. Even with such usability boosts, the BlackBerry OS remains a never-ending procession of menus. The OS was built in an era of keyboards and cursors and despite RIM's attempts to make it more touch-friendly, there's no escaping its legacy. Dip beneath the colourful icons on the homepage and you'll soon find yourself falling down the rabbit hole of yet another menu -- with absolutely no prospect of a usability wonderland at the bottom.. The Bold 9790 has a diminutive 2.45-inch capacitive touchscreen with a resolution of 480x360 pixels at 246 pixels per inch -- a throwback to 2010's Bold 9780 , which sported the same resolution and screen size. Last year's model -- the Bold 9900 -- packed in a fair few more pixels on its slightly larger 2.8-inch touchscreen (it had a resolution of 640x480 pixels at 287ppi). So if it's screen glory you're after, there are better Bolds out there.. The smaller size of the 9790 explains its diddy screen but we're disappointed by the lowly resolution -- text on full web pages such as the CNET UK desktop site is illegible until you zoom in, at which point having such a small screen means it can feel like you're trying to read a poster through a keyhole.. Indeed, the touchscreen on the 9790 is about the size of a mini Post-it note, as shown below.. Touching such a tiny screen doesn't offer a massive enhancement over thumbing the traditional trackpad but you can at least use pinch-to-zoom on web pages and finger flick to scroll through your email. Still, it's an incremental improvement at best.. RIM has also kept the Bold's optical trackpad -- meaning there are multiple (and therefore redundant) ways to navigate the interface or pan around web pages.. Love or hate the Bold's signature Qwerty keyboard -- and you're reading a BlackBerry review so chances are you love it -- rest assured, it's not gone anywhere. RIM has recycled essentially the same keyboard it used on the Bold 9900 for the Bold 9790, with its angled keys and email-friendly Qwerty layout.. As with previous Bolds and Curves , the keyboard takes pride of place. Along with the five BlackBerry navigation keys, it occupies the entire bottom half of the handset's face.. If you're a BlackBerry lover you'll probably be able to type the complete works of Shakespeare on the Bold 9790's keyboard in an afternoon, thanks to its angled keys. But as with most Qwerty-packing BlackBerrys, the keyboard's presence weighs heavily on usability by halving available screen real estate. So if you're after a smart phone for watching videos or doing lots of web browsing you'll want a smart phone with a full-sized touchscreen.. Email and messaging have been BlackBerry's lifeblood for years and, as you'd expect, the Bold 9790 has all the usual messaging suspects on tap. BlackBerry email will hook up to your Gmail, Yahoo mail and Hotmail. There's also BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) and texting, Twitter and Facebook apps that plug you into your social networks and push notifications to your phone.. The BBM app pulls in all types of messaging -- email, social networks, instant messaging, SMS text, Facebook and so on into a single feed. This makes it easy to see who's been talking to you. From here there are also options to reply in various ways so you don't need to dive off into the full-fat Facebook app just to reply to a message.. On the 9790 you can also connect Facebook with your BlackBerry Calendar and Contacts. Once you've signed in, Facebook events are automatically added to your BlackBerry Calendar and the contacts on your phone can be linked with your Facebook account. So the latest profile pictures of your mates will be added to your phone contacts list.. But be warned -- this option also shares your phone contacts with Facebook and can eat up extra data. If you're on a pay-as-you-go tariff you may not want to check this box.. The Facebook app itself is packed with features -- including the ability to view your profile, upload photos and post status updates, check in to Facebook Places, view the news feed, see messages, notifications, friend requests, use Facebook chat, search for friends... The 9790 has a 1GHz chip inside so it's a smidgen less beefy than last year's Bold 9900, which had 1.2GHz under the hood. We found the OS fast and responsive, with menus opening zippily and apps loading promptly.. Full websites are a little slow to render in the native web browser so expect to see a fair amount of grey and white checkerboard as you pan around the site. We found scrolling and zooming fast and fluid though -- all the more so because you're able to pinch or flick the touchscreen (assuming you can fit your fingers on it).. Be warned -- there's no Adobe Flash support so lots of online videos won't play. There is a YouTube app though to provide your daily cute cat video fix.. BlackBerrys have long been lauded for their ability to eke out their battery like a squirrel husbanding its store of winter nuts. The 9790's spec sheet claims it will last 18 days on standby, or bank enough juice for 6.3 hours of video playback or 33 hours of music. Talktime is also apparently good for 5.2 hours of continuous yakking.. We found battery performance to be okay -- you'll easily get a day's normal use out of the Bold and, if you're only tapping infrequently, you might even manage several days without having to charge it. That said, heavy use -- playing with the phone a lot, leaving its screen on for long periods and having Wi-Fi switched on -- drank a surprisingly hefty slurp of juice in a short period. That's surprising considering the 9790's dinky screen.. Watching videos certainly eats up the battery but with such a small screen you're unlikely to want to clock up hours of viewing.. Hot Products.

Meet the BlackBerry Bold 9790, Curve 9380. Curve 9380 lock button and jack. Just announced in Jakarta , the BlackBerry Bold 9790 has a narrow QWERTY keyboard form factor, similar to the Bold 9700/9780. RIM calls it an evolution of the Bold form factor, which has also included wide QWERTY smartphones such as the recent 9900. The 2.45-inch LCD touch screen has a resolution of only 480x360 pixels (HVGA), which is rather low by the standards of midrange smartphones these days. Carlo Chiarello, RIM's handheld product management senior vice president, has assured us that it has the "right balance of resolution and LCD quality," resulting in good "blacks and contrast levels.". The Bold 9790 comes with a raised row of buttons under the touch-screen display, which is a departure from the usual flushed version. Love it or hate it, it is reminiscent of the buttons found on the Torch 9860. We especially like how the keys just seem to curve and fall off the edges.. The battery cover has a soft-touch finish, which is pleasant to hold and provides enough grip to prevent the phone from slipping out of our hands.. The onboard 5-megapixel autofocus camera comes with a flash and records VGA videos.. You'll find the charging port on the bottom of the phone, which makes it easier to use the phone while it is plugged in. In terms of storage, you'll get 8GB of internal memory, expandable up to 32GB via a microSD slot.. The volume rocker and shortcut key on the side of the phone are protruding narrow ridges. This may cause some discomfort when holding the phone for a long phone call, but we'll find out in our in-depth review pretty soon.. How does the Bold 9790 stack up against earlier BB models in terms of size? From left to right: Bold 9700, Bold 9900, Bold 9790.. The Bold 9790 is lighter and slimmer and has a faster processor clocked at 1GHz compared with the 9700's 624MHz.. The Bold 9900 is definitely bigger than the 9790, due to its wider form factor. The bumpers on the Bold 9790 lack the premium feel of the 9900's brushed-metal finish.. From faux leather (Bold 9700) to "glass weave technology" (Bold 9900) and now soft touch, the back covers of these Berries have seen many iterations.. The Bold 9790 is noticeably slimmer than the 9700, and feels more tapered at the edges, too.. So which Bold design do you like best? RIM has announced that the Bold 9790 will be available in Indonesia on November 26, with the first 1,000 customers getting a 50 percent discount off the estimated retail price of $515. Pricing and availability for other countries have not been announced yet, so check with your telcos.. In Jakarta, we also caught a peek of the Curve 9380, the first all-touch Curve device. The Curve series has always consisted of entry-level handsets, such as the 8520 .. The 3.2-inch touch screen shares the same resolution as the Bold 9790--480x360 pixels.. When asked if RIM will drop its traditional QWERTY keyboards for future BBX smartphones, Chiarello assured us that this is not the case. "Not a chance," he said--but we definitely haven't seen the last of all-touch BlackBerry handhelds.. Like the Bold 9790, the Curve 9380's micro-USB port is located at the bottom of the phone.. We like the clean look and feel of the lock button and 3.5mm audio jack.. The slim profile of the 9380 ensures that it sits comfortably in small hands.. The BlackBerry Curve 9380's onboard 5-megapixel autofocus camera comes with a flash and records VGA videos. Chiarello says the demand for non-camera versions of current models has decreased as it is possible to disable/enable a BB camera directly via BES. As a result, we may not see many more non-camera BB handsets, unless operators request for it.. Copyright © 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

The BlackBerry Bold 9790 features an updated interface, easy-to-use keyboard, and excellent ergonomics but lacks in terms of RAM speed and display size. This is a phone for the BlackBerry fan. The Bold 9790 is currently available for under Rs. The phone comes with a 2.45-inch TFT touchscreen display that has a resolution of 480 x 360, working out to a pixel density of 245 PPI that is a tad inadequate for videos, games or browsing, requiring users to zoom in and out, but shows bright colors. The screen is plastic rather than glass, highlighting the need for a protective screen to prevent scratches. The phone features a QWERTY keyboard and an optical trackpad for moving the cursor. Users also have the option to use the touchscreen instead for navigation. In terms of measurements, the phone is 110 x 60 x 11.4 mm while weighing 107 grams.
