Matteo Doni June 6, 2016. 5.5‚Ä≥ 1080√ó1920 IPS LCD screen Mediatek Helio X10 Octa-core chipset (2GHz) Power VR G6200 GPU 16GB/2GB RAM or 32GB/3GB RAM Dual SIM 13MP f/2.2 camera with Phase Detection Autofocus 5MP f/2.0 Selfie camera 4000 mAh battery WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS, FM Radio and IR Port Fingerprint scanner. Last year I reviewed the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2, a great value device with excellent specs. Just over three months after the launch of the Redmi Note 2 Xiaomi announced the Redmi Note 3. I spent some pocket money recently and purchased one to see if it is a worthy successor or upgrade on the Redmi Note 2.. Xiaomi is going from strength to strength in the global smartphone market, and their growth outside China is currently driven by the Redmi Note 3. The third iteration of the Redmi Note line comes hot on the heels of of the Redmi Note 2, and shares some of its specs on paper, but is a very different product overall. TL;DR: for ¬£120 you are getting a lot of smartphone.. The device reviewed is a 32GB storage 3GB RAM one, purchased from an AliExpress seller in China. Google apps and services were side-loaded by me, as this is a Chinese version.. As mentioned earlier, the Redmi Note 3 may have a lot of similarities with the Redmi Note 2 on the spec sheet, but it feels like a completely different device to use. The all metal body design, heftier feel because of the bigger battery and the fingerprint scanner make for a much more pleasant overall ergonomic use.. The front of the device is dominated by the lovely Full HD IPS display which is crisp and has punchy colours. Below the screen you find the capacitive control buttons (multitasking, home and back). Above the screen you find the earpiece, proximity and light sensors and the 5MP selfie camera.. The right side of the device just has the power and volume rocker buttons.. The bottom of the device is where you‚Äôll find the microphone hole and MicroUSB port, which is offset to the left (as on the Redmi Note 2).. The left side of the Redmi Note 3 is home to the Dual SIM tray.. On the top of the device you‚Äôll find the infra-red port, a 3.5mm audio jack and a noise cancelling microphone.. The back of the device has a mono-speaker grille at the bottom, a shiny MI logo above it, a fingerprint scanner easily used with an index finger and the 13MP camera and flash.. The Redmi Note 3‚Äôs body has rounded sides and is made of metal, with matching silver plastic panels at the top and bottom which cover the antennas. Overall it fells like a premium device to hold and the fingerprint scanner is fast and reliable.. The Redmi Note 3 runs on MIUI, Xiaomi‚Äôs Android-based operating system. MIUI is frequently updated and has its own UX language, launcher, apps and theme engine.. Flat design and a drawer-less launcher make for a compelling, even if iOS-like, user experience. When compared with Huawei‚Äôs similar EMUI, MIUI seems to be more polished and have less ‚Äúconflicting features‚Äù. Currently my Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is running MIUI 7.3, which is based on Android 5.0.2 and has the April 2016 security patch applied. Updates with minor and incremental improvements and bug fixes have been arriving on an almost monthly basis and I enjoy the overall MIUI experience.. If you are after a more Google-like Android experience, it is simple enough to install a third party launcher, like the excellent Action Launcher 3, and any apps you would like. That‚Äôs the beuty of the Android ecosystem.. The 13MP camera on the back is an improvement over the Redmi Note 2 in day to day use and produces good pictures in bright light conditions, but can be noisy and slow in low light. The MIUI camea software is pretty comprehensive, includes HDR and scene modes, panaorama, manual and beautify modes.. The 5MP Selfie camera is pretty good and is complemented by some pretty cool software features such as beauty mode, gender and age detection. I‚Äôm easily amused: I often try and trick the selfie camera to making it believe some amusing things‚Ä¶. The 4000 mAh battery keeps things ticking over for a full day for me, and that is an impressive achievement. Whether streaming Amazon Prime Music, playing Goat Simulator or Threes, I‚Äôve never seen a noticeable slow down or lag in using the device. As someone who doesn‚Äôt believe in benchmarks, I consider the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 a reliable workhorse, and performance can be managed through the power settings.. On paper, the Redmi Note 3 wasn‚Äôt much of an upgrade over the Redmi Note 2, but in everyday use it definitely is. The 4000 mAh battery keeps things ticking for longer, the metal body and fingerprint scanner make for better ergonomics and usability. If you are in the market for a 5.5‚Ä≥ smartphone the Redmi Note 3 is a definite buy from me, unless you need expandable storage. The only fly in the soup for the Redmi Note 3 is the lack of MicroSD expansion, but if not go crazy on AliExpress.com. There is also a Qualcomm Snapdragon powered version of the Redmi Note 3, which also has MicroSD expansion so consider that as well.. Last year I reviewed the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2, a great value device with excellent specs. Just over three months after the launch of the Redmi Note 2 Xiaomi announced the Redmi Note 3. I spent some pocket money recently and purchased one to see if it is a worthy successor or upgrade on the Redmi Note 2. Xiaomi is going from strength to strength in the global smartphone market, and their growth outside China is currently driven by the Redmi Note 3. The third iteration of the Redmi Note line comes hot on the heels of of the Redmi Note 2, and shares some of its specs on paper, but is a very different product overall. TL;DR: for ¬£120 you are getting a lot of smartphone. Specifications 5.5" 1080x1920 IPS LCD screen Mediatek Helio X10 Octa-core chipset (2GHz) Power VR G6200 GPU 16GB/2GB RAM or 32GB/3GB RAM Dual SIM 13MP f/2.2 camera with Phase Detection Autofocus 5MP f/2.0 Selfie camera 4000 mAh battery WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS, FM Radio and IR Port Fingerprint scanner The device reviewed is a 32GB storage 3GB RAM one, purchased from an AliExpress seller in China. Google apps and services were side-loaded by me, as this is a Chinese version. As mentioned earlier, the Redmi Note 3 may have a lot of similarities with the Redmi Note 2 on the spec sheet, but it feels like a completely different device to use. The all metal body design, heftier feel because of the bigger battery and the fingerprint scanner make for a much more pleasant overall ergonomic use. The front of the device is dominated by the lovely Full HD IPS display which is crisp and has punchy colours. Below the screen you find the capacitive control buttons (multitasking, home and back). Above the screen you find the earpiece, proximity and light sensors and the 5MP selfie camera. The right side of the device just has the power and volume rocker buttons. The bottom of the device is where you'll find the microphone hole and MicroUSB port, which is offset to the left (as on the Redmi Note 2). The left side of the Redmi Note 3 is home to the Dual SIM tray. On the top of the device you'll find the infra-red port, a 3.5mm audio jack and a noise cancelling microphone. The back of the device has a mono-speaker grille at the bottom, a shiny MI logo above it, a fingerprint scanner easily used with an index finger and the 13MP camera and flash. The Redmi Note 3's body has rounded sides and is made of metal, with matching silver plastic panels at the top and bottom which cover the antennas. Overall it fells like a premium device to hold and the fingerprint scanner is fast and reliable. Software The Redmi Note 3 runs on MIUI, Xiaomi's Android-based operating system.

Phones also support two SIM cards or a SIM card + microSDHC card because one SIM card and the microSDHC card share the same physical tray slot.. One notable difference between the MediaTek and Qualcomm variants of the phone is the primary camera. The Mediatek phone uses a less powerful 13MP camera sensor, whereas this is upgraded to a 16MP sensor on the Qualcomm models. The Snapdragon versions use a special display technology known as 'Sunlight Display' in which the phone detects the ambient light and makes pixel level adjustments in order to be better legible in the sunlight. It also features a blue light filter for low light night reading. Another notable feature of the phone is the presence of a finger-print sensor at the back. It is not only fast but very accurate as well. It can be used from all directions and can unlock the phone in around 0.1 seconds. It can also be used for capturing images via the front or the rear cameras.. Kenzo runs on an Android based MIUI 7 OS which was upgraded to MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0 and then to the newest MIUI 9.

Custom ROMs for Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. Resurrection Remix ROM 5.8.X (Official [Android 7.1.2]). The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 smartphone is the larger brother to the original Redmi 3 smartphone. It comes with a display that is an extra half an inch larger (5.5 inches) and also in two variants. One of the variants is a single SIM, and the other is a dual SIM. Both the single and dual SIM options have different processors (or system chips a.k.a SoC‚Äôs), and that is how you can easily identify them.. You need to be able to identify them if you plan on installing a custom ROM because the custom ROMs are either developed for the Mediatek processor of the Snapdragon processor. You can find out what version of the CPU chipset you have on the Redmi Note 3 by navigating to the Settings > About Device and then taking a look at where it shows you the model number. Additionally, the different processors are often sold in the various regions. For example, the dual SIM might not be available in the United States and the people getting the dual SIM are from the Asian countries. In other words, if you have a friend who is in the same country as you and the have the Snapdragon CPU, then yours will likely have it as well.. These are the best custom ROMs out there to be installed on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 smartphone for you to install today.. Note: Make sure you check what model number the custom ROM is made for from the download links. Whenever we create a post such as this one, it means the model numbers are all thrown into the same article. Don‚Äôt assume that all custom ROMs will work for all model numbers. Each download link will mention what model number the ROM is for somewhere on the page, either in the custom ROM thread title or the original post closer to the download link. If you still don‚Äôt see it there then have a read of some comments or leave a comment yourself if you aren‚Äôt sure, and the custom ROM poster or other people subscribed to the thread will help you out.. If you want to have a pure MIUI operating system that is running on the Android 6.0-Android 6.1 Marshmallow software updates, then you should check out this pureMIUI Marshmallow custom ROM. You can expect to find that this pure MIUI is like having the Android Open Source Project but instead of Android being the centrepiece of the operating system, it is now MIUI. The main difference being any bloatware from the phone carrier networks is now taken away.. It‚Äôs hard to tell what the developer is stating about this custom ROM because he isn‚Äôt writing in English. Usually, people must write in English on the XDA-Developers forum and if they don‚Äôt then the thread is deleted. But since this is a good custom ROM it looks like the thread has stayed up, but we just can‚Äôt understand what he is saying. If you are really interested in installing the pure MIUI custom ROM, then you might want to try Google translate and see what it says.. Download: AGNI pureMIUI Marshmallow ROM. While it‚Äôs still a Nightly build and not a stable release, the Resurrection Remix custom ROM available here is being installed by many people because it is the official version. These official ROMs have very few bugs, and all of the features will obviously be working since it is put together by the official team. Resurrection Remix custom ROMs come with loads of feature and is a highly customizable ROM.. But arguably the best feature of this Resurrection Remix custom ROM is the fact that it is based on the Android 7.1.2 Nougat software update. To put that into perspective, the people with the Mediatek processor only have ROMs based on the Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Also, Android 7.1.2 is practically the newest version of Android that you will find installed on any device out there.. Note: this Resurrection Remix custom ROM is the most downloaded and installed custom ROM for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 smartphone to date, amassing over three-quarters of a million views and nearly two hundred thousand more downloads than any other ROM for the device.. Download: Resurrection Remix version 5.8 ROM. Another hugely successful custom ROM for the Redmi Note 3 smartphone is this Nitrogen OS. The Nitrogen OS ROM has amassed over half a million downloads and installed. The main reason for that is much like the Resurrection Remix custom ROM listed above: it is based on the Android 7.1.2 Nougat software update as well. Don‚Äôt forget that the number one reason for installing a custom ROM in the first place is to try to update the device to a version of Android that never rolled out for the device. Also hugely popular is when a really new version of Android is available for people to try and they haven‚Äôt ever seen it before. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening here with the Nitrogen OS custom ROM.. With all of that being said, the Nitrogen OS is a great ROM and does come with some great features in its own right. It isn‚Äôt just all about the fact that it is based on the Android 7.1.2 Nougat software update‚Äîthough that will always be the number one reason. Nitrogen OS is based on CyanogenMod, the Android Open Source project, DU and Pure.. The XenonHD 7.1 is another high-quality custom ROM available for the Redmi Note 3 smartphone. XenonHD is a name that many people know because the team builds custom ROMs for many devices, similar to CyanogenMod and Resurrection Remix (and Nitrogen OS to a lesser extent.) The 7.1 listed in the title isn‚Äôt the version of the custom ROM but rather the version of Android that it is based on (which is sure to make many people happy.) In other words, the XenonHD custom ROM is based on the Android 7.1 Nougat software update, and it will probably continue to be updated into the future with newer versions of Nougat too.. The XenonHD custom ROM is based on the CyanogenMod builds.. Download: XenonHD Android 7.1 ROM. The unofficial version of the CyanogenMod 13 custom ROM is available for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 smartphone with the Mediatek system chip. These CyanogenMod custom ROMs are not being made anymore, but when they were, they were the best available out of any custom ROM. Their failure to still be making custom ROMs was not because they were not good. was the only custom ROM name that was a full fledged company, and when the company went bust, they also stopped making custom ROMs at the same time. Many of the developers from CyanogenMod are now working under the LineageOS name instead, so those are the best custom ROMs to be installing at the moment. You might also be aware that CyanogenMod wasn‚Äôt just a custom ROM for itself but was also being used as the source code and base for many other ROMs. The LineageOS name has taken over from that role and now provides the same kind of solid foundation for other ROM makers to use.. The CyanogenMod 13 custom ROMs are always based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and go all the way through to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow depending on how many updates they get. Generally speaking, if a lot of people are installing the ROMs, then they will keep getting updated. But the CyanogenMod 13 never goes up above Marshmallow, so if you ever get a Nougat ROM, it will then be called LineageOS for that Android 7.0 and above version.. No one really prefers having an unofficial build over an official one, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt get stable unofficial custom ROMs. The 5.5.9 version of the Resurrection Remix custom ROM that is available here is a good one even though the developer who ported the ROM over from another device doesn‚Äôt speak excellent English. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not high-quality work. We are starting to see skilled developers who can‚Äôt talk English very well.. One of the problems you can find with unofficial custom ROMs though is some of the features not working like they would if the official custom ROM was available and sometimes the features don‚Äôt work at all. The problems with things not working are usually listed in the original post where you can find the download link. In this instance, the original poster has listed that the 4G connection only works with the first SIM card slot. The second SIM card slot can only use 2G. That‚Äôs not a huge deal, and some smartphones come out with this by default. The other issue that has been noted by the original developer is the fingerprint sensor might not be working either.. Download: Resurrection Remix version 5.5.9 ROM. By far the custom ROM for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 that has amassed the most views, the CyanogenMod 12.1 custom ROM is based on the older Android Lollipop and comes with the working fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint sensor was obviously one of the highlight features on smartphones over the last few years. This fingerprint reader is built into the devices themselves, but if the operating system isn‚Äôt able to use it, then it becomes a waste of space. Sadly, that has been the case with many custom ROMs over the time since it‚Äôs been out for technical difficulties we don‚Äôt know how to explain. If ever you can find a custom ROM‚Äîlike you do have here with the CyanogenMod 12.1 custom ROM‚Äîthat has the fingerprint reader working, then you can rest assured that it is going to be used by many people.. Another reason why this CyanogenMod 12.1 (The older versions of CyanogenMod) has so many downloads is that it is older and more people were checking out the ROMs available back then. If it were me looking for a ROM to install today, I‚Äôd probably go with the CyanogenMod 13 instead because it‚Äôs newer.. Update: As it turns out, this CyanogenMod 12.1 is a stable build whereas the other (later) CyanogenMod 13 listed above is still in its ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù stages. That is going to be the main reason people are installing the CyanogenMod 12.1 ROM‚Äîand I agree with that until the CM 13 is a stable build as well (if that time ver comes.). Download: CyanogenMod 12.1 unofficial ROM. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 owners aren‚Äôt having much luck with getting official custom ROMs developers so far on the list, but the names of the unofficial ROMs are good. The Bliss Pop custom ROM is a favourite to many. As we‚Äôve already said, unofficial builds can have some additional bugs or even features not working. Some of the functions that are listed as not working for this version of the Bliss Pop custom ROM include the fingerprint sensor and the 4G for the second SIM card. You can only use the 2G on the second SIM (because this is a dual SIM smartphone with the Mediatek system chip.). Bliss Pop version 4.0.3 for the Redmi Note 3 smartphone is based on the Android 5.1 Lollipop software updates and may be updated to newer version of Lollipop such as the Android 5.1.1 software update. However, it will never go up any higher than Lollipop. The update to Marshmallow‚Äìif the Bliss Pop ROM ever provides it‚Äîwill be given a new version number..

TWRP comes to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (MediaTek), LG L90, and Android One 3rd Edition (General Mobile 5 Plus). 2016/06/29 6:13am PST Jun 29, 2016. Development LG News Redmi Note 3. Source: TWRP Redmi Note 3 MTK , TWRP LG L90 , TWRP Android One Third Edition. Midrange devices are really the perfect target for something like TWRP. they usually suffer from intolerably bloated interfaces and/or get updates way too late or not at all. A custom recovery is the starting point from which any enterprising user can start flashing mods and custom ROMs onto their device to get over any of the previously mentioned hurdles.. And so it's nice to see TWRP come to 3 Android phones that count somewhere in the midrange category. The first is the MediaTek version of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (the Snapdragon version got TWRP a couple of months ago ). The second is the LG L90, the upper device in LG's midrange L series. And the third is a group of devices: Android One 3rd Edition phones. However, until today, the General Mobile 5 Plus from Turkey. is the only 3rd generation One. TWRP's pages for each device, which are linked below, detail the different install methods and provide the download links necessary to get TWRP. Start there and be careful to read through everything. Recoveries and flashing aren't for the faint of heart.. Tags Android One custom recovery General Mobile 5 Plus LG L90 mediatek Redmi Note 3 MTK teamwin TWRP.
