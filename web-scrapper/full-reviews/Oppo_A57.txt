Roydon Cerejo , 16 February 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Oppo A57 sports a Snapdragon 435 SoC and 3GB of RAM. The front 16-megapixel camera is very capable in daylight. The Oppo A57 is priced at Rs. The Oppo A57 is a newly launched selfie-oriented smartphone targeted at value-conscious buyers. It sits in the sub-Rs.15,000 price segment and borrows many traits from its pricier sibling, the Oppo F1s. The latter has proven to be a very capable selfie-smartphone, and so it’s time to see if the Oppo A57 manages to deliver similar performance. The successor to the Oppo A37 , this new model boasts of an upgraded processor, better RAM, and more internal storage along with a more recent version of Android. Let’s take a closer look at the Oppo A57. Oppo A57 design and build quality The Oppo A57 is moulded from pretty much the same cast as the F1s, and they share very similar design elements. Having said that, it does come across as less premium compared to the F1s, which is alright since we’re considering a lower price point. Build quality is still pretty solid thanks to the metal frame, although the Oppo A57 does feel a bit like plastic. The phone misses out on a few features such as backlit capacitive buttons. The home button on the Oppo A57. is also of the capacitive type and integrates a fingerprint sensor. The matte texture offers decent amounts of grip so you don’t really need a case.. The 5.2-inch IPS display on the Oppo A57 sports. an HD resolution, which is tolerable as text isn’t too jagged and images appear fairly sharp when viewed from the usual distance. We really liked how bright this phone can get, and sunlight legibility is spot on. Colours are nicely saturated and good viewing angles are good. Oppo uses Gorilla Glass 4 but still throws in one pre-applied screen guard and an extra one in the box for good measure.. There’s a SIM tray on the right of the Oppo A57 that. and a microSD card of up to 256GB. The dedicated slot for storage expansion means you needn’t compromise on using two SIM cards, which we appreciate. There’s a standard Micro-USB port and a 3.5mm headphone socket on the bottom. There’s virtually no camera bump on the back of the Oppo A57. apart from the very mild protrusion of the ring around the camera lens.. The Oppo A57 is slim, light, and easy to live with. In the box, you get a Micro-USB cable, charger, earphones, case, screen guard, SIM ejector tool and some manuals.. Oppo A57 specifications and features The Oppo A57 is powered by a mainstream octa-core Qualcomm SoC called the Snapdragon 435, which is more or less on par with the MediaTek MT6750 seen on the Oppo F1s in terms of performance. AnTuTu and Quadrant posted slightly better numbers - 45,243 and 21,971 points respectively - but 3DMark and GFXbench dipped by small margins. The CPU is accompanied by 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. include Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n (single band), FM radio, USB-OTG, and GPS. VoLTE and 4G are supported on all Indian bands.. The Oppo A57 runs on ColourOS 3.0 which is based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The interface works very well despite it being a significant customisation. The iOS influence is still present, but it’s a bit more subtle this time unlike on Vivo’s custom OS. The notification shade has two pages now as the toggle switches are separated from app alerts. There’s a custom app store from Oppo along with O-Cloud for backups and gestures for single-handed operation and to turn the screen off. Google’s suite of apps including Duo, and some third-party ones like Facebook, Instagram, and Amazon, are also bundled on the. Oppo A57 performance The Oppo A57 cruises through basic apps for social networking and email as well as some light games quite well. The phone only gets a bit warm around the camera area when doing something intensive. On average, we found ourselves with about 1.4GB of free RAM, which is good enough to keep things running smoothly.. The fingerprint sensor works really well and is very quick in authentication. You can also use it to lock apps and files. The phone handles video files up to 1080p and the stock music player can read high- bitrate FLAC files too. The speaker on the Oppo A57. isn’t the loudest for media when there’s a lot of ambient noise but suffices for alerts and ringtones.. The Oppo A57 gets a similar camera configuration as the Oppo F1s, with a 16-megapixel sensor up front and a 13-megapixel shooter at the back. The front sensor is competent under good lighting, producing sharp and detailed selfies. However, low-light pictures taken with the Oppo A57. The screen flash is also pretty weak so unless you have the phone really close to your face, don’t expect miracles here. Beauty mode gets a background blur filter,. but the end result is nowhere near as good as what can be achieved with a dedicated second camera for measuring depth. Other modes on the Oppo A57. include selfie panorama, video, and time-lapse.. (Tap to see full-sized Oppo A57 camera samples). does a pretty decent job in daylight, with detailed landscapes and macros. Colours are captured well and focusing speeds are also good. Low-light performance is average, as details on objects tend to get murky and focusing speeds dip a bit. Video recording on the Oppo A57. maxes out at 1080p and quality is acceptable. Here, shooting modes include Ultra HD which stitches four stills together, Expert mode, filters, GIF, and double exposure.. The Oppo A57 features a non-removable 2900mAh. battery which easily lasted us a full day on a single charge. Our HD video loop test gave us a runtime of 12 hours and 7 minutes, which is very good. There’s no fast charging, so the battery does a take a fair while to fully charge.. Verdict At Rs.14,990, the Oppo A57 offers a package that very similar to the Oppo F1s, but at a more affordable price point, which straightaway makes it better value compared to its slightly older cousin. Low-light camera performance isn’t the best, and basic features such as backlit buttons and dual-band Wi-Fi are missing, but on the plus side. you get similar CPU performance, good build quality, and a very good fingerprint sensor.. Android Marshmallow is another reason to consider the Oppo A57. over the Oppo F1s, as from what Oppo has stated, the Oppo F1s will most likely be stuck on Lollipop. The same could also be true when it comes to the potential future lack of a Nougat update for the Oppo A57, but at least for now its OS is newer. This neglect has long been our pet peeve with budget phones from most brands.. If selfies aren’t your thing, then the Moto G4 Plus. ( Review ) is a better candidate for the job at this price point ( until the Moto G5 arrives , which is pretty soon). However, if you’ve been waiting for the Oppo F1s to drop in price, then the Oppo A57 is the closest you’ll get to it in term of features and performance..

5.2-inch HD IPS 2.5D Arc Curved Glass Display, 1280 x 720 pixel resolution, ~282ppi. 13-megapixel rear camera with phase detection autofocus, f/2.2 aperture and LED flash. 149.1 x 72.9 x 7.65 mm. Pricing and availability of OPPO A57. It took a few good months, but at least it’s now here in the Philippines. The OPPO A57 was announced late last year, and it only arrived this June.. But, was it worth the wait? Does OPPO’s newest midrange smartphone deliver? Or is it going to be another overrated, overpriced, iPhone copycat? Let’s figure that out.. Writing this part of an OPPO review is starting to be a tiring and repetitive job. If you’re familiar with the looks of their previous smartphones, you’ll notice that almost all of them have the same looks. And the OPPO A57 is no exemption. This thing looks pretty much the same as the OPPO A39 , F1s , and even their current flagships.. With that said, the OPPO A57 retains the boring (but battle-tested), all-metal, iPhone-ish look. The unibody build did make it feel sturdy and elegant, but I wish OPPO would go back to the drawing board next time. This new Black Edition variant made it look a tiny bit refreshing, but still, there’s almost no way of telling the difference between the smartphone siblings for the average joe.. But nonetheless, like I said earlier, it’s built robustly. It has some noticeable weight to it, but nothing that’s not bearable. People with small hands might struggle on using this singlehandedly, but it’s 5.2-inch profile still offers better ergonomics than most 5.5-inch devices these days.. The OPPO A57 comes complete with all the necessary ports and slots. The device features a long tray that houses two nano SIM cards and a microSD card. Below the platter is the lock/power switch, in-parallel with the volume controls on the other side. The buttons have the same thin and metal-built profile that compliments the handset. They feel tactile as expected, but they don’t offer the best satisfaction when pressed.. At the bottom, we have the microUSB port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Next to them is the built-in microphone and loudspeaker. The speaker drivers offer decent sound, with enough volume and balanced tones.. Taking a look at the back, we have the 16-megapixel primary camera, coupled with a dual-tone flash. You can also spot the secondary microphone for noise cancellation. The shiny OPPO logo engraved in metal is also nicely placed in here, which does shine better in this black variant.. Going for a metal build in lieu of glass might save you from the annoying fingerprint marks, but it sure ain’t safe in attracting smudges. Bad news for those who have sweaty hands. But don’t worry too much, though. OPPO included a free transparent jelly case out of the box to safeguard the handset from any dangerous elements.. This is where the OPPO A57’s midrange-iness shows up. The phone does have a 5.2-inch HD IPS display, but only has an HD resolution of 1280 x 720. Quality wise, there’s really nothing to complain about this one. Not unless you’re really that finicky.. With that said, the colors are decent. The contrast is really good with deep blacks. And surprisingly, the sharpness is acceptable. The 720p resolution on a 5.2-inch still equates to 282 pixels-per-inch —. The backlighting can also get too strong, making the display a bit excessively bright. This makes the OPPO A57 usable outside even at broad daylight. In case you find it too bright, you can easily dim it via the drop down notification settings.. Like I said earlier, the F3 and F3 Plus are OPPO’s current flagships, not the A57. But neither of them sports the best-in-class processor that’s out today. Hence, don’t be surprised when I tell you that this thing only runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 425. A chip intended for budget devices. It features a 1.95GHz octa-core processor, with 3GB of RAM and an Adreno 510 GPU.. But don’t be fooled by its “budget” processor. As per my tests, the OPPO A57 was able to handle every task that I throw at it. It might have projected some struggles, but it was able to push through. Even mobile games like NBA Live and Real Racing 3 were playable and enjoyable with decent frame rates.. See also: OPPO F3 Review. The 3GB of RAM also did some showing off during my tests. Opening apps and switching between them was fairly speedy. It might encounter a second or two to start, but that’s more like the interface’s fault, or the app itself.. Here’s yet another repetitive part of every OPPO review that we’ve done. However, I actually don’t mind doing another repeat on this part. If you’ve read the previous ones, you’ll know how much I loved the fingerprint scanner that the company utilizes on their devices. As expected, the one on the OPPO A57 is also top notch.. Just like the others, the scanner is embedded on the home button. Which, ironically, isn’t an actual mechanical button. The “button” is actually just the sensor itself. Tapping it will provide the functions you would get from a standard home button (i.e holding it launches the Google Assistant).. But more than that, it also works as a great fingerprint scanner. It’s even one of the best that I have used in a while. It instantly unlocks the device with just a quick tap of a finger, with almost 90% success rate. I can’t even remember an instance where I had to use the lock screen pattern when it fails to register my finger. The OPPO A57 might run in a painfully outdated Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow version, but you’ll barely notice it due to its thick ColorOS v3.0.0i interface.. OPPO own interface took a lot of design inspiration from the iOS, just like what they did in the design. The native app icons, fonts, and the overall minimalistic feel — all of which were pioneered by Apple. It might not be against anyone’s morale, but it sure is good for business as a lot of consumers really do admire this layout.. However, an operating system is more than just the visible interface. You might not see it, but having an outdated software version removes your chances to experience the benefits of Android’s latest Nougat version.. Unlike its flagship brethren and pretty much almost all of its competing devices, the OPPO A57 lacks a dual-camera setup. A feature that has become a standard to most devices that are coming out today. But to compensate, OPPO rigged the A57 with a 13-megapixel shooter at the back, and a 16-megapixel camera on the front to make it nonpartisan to its “Selfie Expert” brothers.. The primary camera at the back can take great and acceptable photos. It sure is not the best, but the pictures you can take are still “Instagramable”. The OPPO A57 can take good photos at good lighting as well. When shooting in Auto Mode, the images taken look sharp, with just the right contrast and saturation. Keep in mind though that a simple exposure adjustment when shooting can greatly make a difference.. But it’s not the same case in terms of low-light scenarios where the OPPO A57 isn’t so good. A huge amount of detail is compromised, but still nothing too serious. You can still pretty much nail a night-out photo op for as long as you’re patient with adjusting the focus and exposure. But if you’re all about run-and-gun, then this might really disappoint.. Now let’s head on to the most critical and important of any 2017 smartphone review — the front-facing selfie camera. And if you’re really all about taking self-portraits, then you might be looking at your next smartphone.. The 16-megapixel selfie shooter on the OPPO A57 performed a satisfactory job on my tests. It sure is not the best (its bigger brothers are better), but then again, good enough to take “Instagramable” pictures. OPPO might have compromised and removed the secondary wide-angle camera, but I still managed to fit a couple of friends in the frame.. Each selfies / groufies taken delivers great brightness — so great that the exposure can be overblown at times. Colors are also good, although the contrast is a bit disappointing. Furthermore, the sharpness and details are also a bit awful. The images might appear bright and visible, but taking a closer look you’ll notice how soft and dull the details are. This might be because of the Beautify mode being turned on.. The OPPO A57 has all of the necessary medium you’ll need for communication. It has WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, 4G LTE with VoLTE support, and a microUSB 2.0 port.. Both its WiFi and Bluetooth antennas might not be the latest versions, but it was still able to get the job done. The device was able to maintain a good connection with our wireless home network wherever I am around the house. Connecting the OPPO A57 to my wireless speakers and headphones was also seamless.. The 4G LTE connectivity was also reliable. For as long as your area has 4G reception, you’re pretty much good to go.. Related: OPPO F3 Plus Full Review. However, it looks like OPPO is still taking its good, sweet time in traveling to the future. Earlier, we’ve stated that the OPPO A57 only runs on Android Marshmallow. And now, it looks like the company is still turning a blind eye to the USB Type-C revolution.. Almost all of the smartphone manufacturer today has already adopted the implementation to either one or two of their latest release. But OPPO, for some reason, doesn’t show any interest in USB Type-C. Even their latest R11 line doesn’t sport it.. This move might benefit the consumer, as they might have a lot of spare microUSBs lying around ready as a backup. However, the gaining popularity of the new standard suggests that it really is the future.. Almost all of the OPPO devices that we have tested garnered a passing mark in the battery department. The A57 also has great uptime.. Inside we have the non-removable 2900mAh Li-Ion battery. A capacity that’s fair enough to complement its low power HD display and efficient Snapdragon 435 processor.. Performance wise, the OPPO A57 was able to last me for more than a day. I used the device for casual web browsing, streaming videos online, and using social media applications like Facebook and Instagram.. I also ran PCMark’s battery test that simulates dailt tasks until the battery percentage reaches 20%. It then took the app 5 hours and 18 minutes before it reached the limit.. Unlike their other offerings, it looks like OPPO finally got the sweet spot with the A57. Compared to the F3 and F3 Plus, the A57 is a bit more reasonably priced. However, there are still a lot of better alternatives out there if you’re looking for a phone in this price range. But at least, the A57 is a foot forward to the right direction.. The smartphone might have the same, boring look, but the sturdy build was also maintained. The device also has a capable processor that’s ideal for multitasking, and gaming that’s projected to its modest 720p screen.. Moreover, some of the OPPO A57’s worth-noting features include the ever-so-fast fingerprint scanner, good battery life, and clean interface.. However, the OPPO A57 software is also one of its major weakness. Their ColorOS interface might be able to hide it, but no one can still deny the fact that it only runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. This can be a big deal breaker to avid Android fanboys.. OPPO has been pushing the A57 as a handset for “Unstoppable Selfies”, but its picture-taking capabilities aren’t its only forte.. But with that said, we’re pretty sure the OPPO A57 will still be a crowd favorite. For some reason, a lot consumers do prefer an Android device dressed in an iPhone body. And it appears that’s where OPPO’s eyes are. The A57 is one of the closest you can get to an OPPO F3 and F3 Plus — or if I may say it bluntly, the closest you can get to an iPhone for its price.. The OPPO A57 is currently available for Php11,999 in all OPPO stores and kiosks, as well as third-party retailers in both online and in malls. Along with other OPPO devices, the unit can also be purchased at. Shopee for the same price, with FREE shipping and Cash on Delivery payment option..

It is been almost now 30 days I am using OPPO A57. My short experience about OPPO A57 is like this. 01) Very nice display - no problem even if use under direct sunlight. 02) Battery life is good compared to my last samsung phone. 03) App performance is also better. I think Apps on OPPO A57 consumes slightly less data than other phones. 04) Camera results are excellent during day light conditions. 05) Dedicated Micro SD card slot - no Hybrid slot. So, now I can use 2 sim cards and one memory card at one go. What I do not like about OPPO A57. 01) navigation buttons are not backlit. 02) I am not happy with the camera performance under low light.

I purchased this phone for my mum as she needed a replacement for her old Nokia Lumia. She has found it very simple to use and loves the camera. The phone has a very good processor and RAM for its price and she hasn't had any complaints in the last 8 months. The phone runs smoothly and also takes great pictures.

I tried to mms a 15 second video the other day and got a no go box saying maximum mms size is 300k. So how do I send a video from this phone? Never had this problem with my old Iphone 4. Any feedback on the speaker and phone volume ?. I The Oppo A57 has a fairly good external speaker, nice clean sound and goes to a decent sound level. The phone volume (if you mean when speaking) is good also, clean sound with no muffling. I compared this phone's sound with a Sony Xperia xa1 also and the Oppo was shown to have a much clearer and slightly louder speaker both when listening to music and when speaking on the phone. The screen is nice and crisp looking also. I think it's a good phone for the current price. I got this information off the net, I assume it is correct (see link below).

Oppo is bringing Oppo A57 as the first smartphone in 2017 in Bangladeshi market to continue with its rising popularity. Among the strong reasons behind Oppo's popularity is its product quality, attractive pricing, quality branding and dedicated service. These should be included with A57. In terms of feature, this device is not among the high premium phones. HD display and snapdragon 435 chipset can't be considered as premium features. But other features like 13 + 16 MP great quality camera, 3 GB RAM + 32 GB ROM, OTG, fingerprint sensor, 4G network support, Octa-core CPU and adreno 505 GPU represents a well made smart machine. If you can compromise on the relatively lower quality HD display (Full HD would have been perfect) and smaller 5.2 inch display (5.5 inch is popular these days for watching videos and gaming), this can be a highly considerable choice for the price..
