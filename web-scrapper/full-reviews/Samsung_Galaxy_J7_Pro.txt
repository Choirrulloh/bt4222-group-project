User ratings and reviews for Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro. 3.5 Out of 5. 5 Star 16 4 Star 3 3 Star 2 2 Star 4 1 Star 8. Displaying review(s) 1- 5 of 26 Sort by: Most Helpful Most Recent. By Krunal Patel | 9 Sep 2017. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 3 out of 5 people found this review helpful. By Vhs123 | 27 Oct 2017. I bought this phone in October for Â£200 as a replacement for my note 5. The design is very classy (s7 esque) and although it doesn't have a waterproof rating I have dropped it many times and it is still holding up well. To put s8 style software on this was a genius move by samsung. The display os very bright and might just be better than my old note 5. The fingerprint scanner is very quick (almost too quick) and the always on display is a great feature. It would have been great if they incorporated haptic feedback. This is one thing I missed coming from a note 5. The speaker is adequate but nothing special. The camera produces some good quality photos in recent lighting and both cameras have a flash. However it seems a bit half baked. An omission of simple modes like a slow motion or time lapse mode is strange. As for speed this phone is very snappy. If youu turn the developer options on and change the animation scale to 0.5 then it feels very responsive. It runs games well and doesn't get as hot as my note 5. The dual SIM and micro sd card slot are nice additions and I love little features here and there like double tapping the recent key to go to your last app and the ability to control how bright the flashlight is. Battery life is sublime easily lasting me 2 days and standby time is good for and android phone. However charging the 3600mah battery pack takes about 3 hours which is annoying. I hope that you find this review useful and I would definitely. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 7 out of 7 people found this review helpful. By Preet Kaur | 3 Oct 2017.

We can not guarantee that the information on this page is 100% correct. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro - user opinions and reviews. I bought two already for my friends...for 200 euros it is definitely the best budget phone on the market. Cameras, screen, speaker, battery, built quality, 32 GB memory...simply perfect !. I have Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x mediatek decacore 64gb 4gb Ram. Redmi Note 4x mediatek decacore costs about half of Samsung but is much faster, does not freeze, looks better and the screen is much better... Purchase 'galaxy charging current pro' app. Charging at a low current (mA) will not spoil your battery and it will last long. I have charged my A9 pro 2016 for 10 hours at 500 to 600 mA. If needed urgently, I will charge at 1200 or 1800 mA.

Since there was no reviews at the time of purchase, I was a bit wary, however, I bought this from an Amazon seller, Fulfilled by Amazon, mine arrived in the original Samsung box with all documentation, cable and US charger. However, when I went through the setup, the language was in not in English (US), so I scrolled down for a while and found English (US) easily. ****I bought the PINK color, however, it is not a true pink, it is more of a Rose Gold, it does not look very pink in my opinion. So I believe that I am the FIRST REVIEWER for this phone in Pink (it is a soft pink almost like a Rose Gold in color). My goal in this review is to hopefully put your mind at ease about buying this device. Please note that this review reflects my personal opinions and experience with this phone. PROS: 1) 32GB of Internal Storage...however after the OS and Factory Apps, it had 24.5gb left. After I installed lots of personal Apps, I have 20.3gb left. Plenty left if I want to install more apps or updates on apps. 2) 4G/LTE Data...I have a ATT Data plan so I tested for 4G/LTE on an app and it verified that I have 4G/LTE. It is fast and works perfectly when I out of a WI-FI area. 3) Android OS---My phone arrived with Nougat 7.0 pre-installed. And it auto updated a minor update of 181GB improvements /fixes etc. 4) WiFi---My WiFi Router connected immediately to this tablet and it is a fast WiFi. The WiFi is super strong and I receive 5 bars around my home and it keeps the connection even in my backyard. 5) Display---The display is very, very clear and colors vivid as it has 401PPI sharpness. Reading on Internet or PDF Book, the text is crisp. The videos in YouTube are very clear as well. 6) Speed and Performance---For my personal use, I find do the speed and performance excellent for the things I do such as Facebook, Twitter, Internet, YouTube, Email, etc. I do not play games on this tablet yet I found all videos run very well. Performs well, no lagging and no freezing. 7) WiFi calling---I have had a Google Voice account for several years so I tried Google Hangouts for my WiFi calling and it worked wonderfully. However, I use my phone plan with Unlimited minutes and texts. 8) External Slot for SD Card---So I installed a SanDisk 128gb Micro SD card which was loaded with my music, pictures, home videos and files. I still have 75 gb left on my SD Card. According to Gsmarena, this device holds up to 256 GB (dedicated slot). 9) Camera---I actually took some inside and outside pictures and saved them to my SD Card. The pictures (indoors and outdoors) are very clear, excellent for sending in email or even Facebook. My videos also came out well. 10) Battery life and Device Coolness---Battery life I find excellent and I am a heavy user of apps. I watch lots of YouTube videos, Facebook, listen to my music etc. My battery starts off at 100 percent, then after one hour of heavy use it shows close to 93 percent. ***Device coolness/Battery coolness---I use an app Widget free from Playstore called Battery Solo. When I press, the highest it showed me was a cool 88 degrees Fahrenheit. This is excellent and the battery a device stays cool, it never overheats. 11) USB Port is MICRO not a type C. However it does have OTG (On the Go), which means with a USB/Micro adapter, you can insert a USB Flash drive, USB mouse, keyboard (one at a time). I use this to copy files from my Flash drive to my phone or vice versa). Cons...just Three cons, and not serious: 1) USB Port is MICRO not a type C. However, I was happy because I have several MICRO chargers. No need to buy a new Type C one as my spare charger. 2) I finally found a cover /wallet case here on Amazon. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CFCGZ1/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1#customerReviews 3) Color of my J7 Pro is a very, very light ROSE GOLD. It is not a true pink as shown in the pictures in this description. * Would I purchase this device over again? Yes, in a heartbeat because of the 32GB storage and Nougat OS. It is a wonderful phone at a reasonable cost, so I recommend it. Since I am a Techie, if you have any questions about this device, please ask me in the comments section. And I will answer all questions about this device. Thanks you for reading my review, I hope that it has been helpful for you in making your decision about this phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Worth your $$.. Size: 32GB (Dual-SIM) | Color: Gold | Verified Purchase. Been using the gold J7 Pro for nearly 2 wks now. Bought it because i had the J700 before this. I wasn't going to upgrade but my phone was stolen. front flash with the front cam of 13mp is amazing. Since this is an international phone, the start up will be in a different language. Mine was in Indian, and real easy to change it to English. Also, there are no full cover glass screen protectors for this model or heavy duty hard cases. Best bet to buy them from eBay, but long shipping(3wk to 2 months). The gold color is more like silver with a hint of gold. From a distance it may look like rose gold, but then the gold color again. First time ever using the fingerprint, and it has been fun. 32gb phone + additional sd slot if needed for more data. I bought a nice hard tpu case from eBay and does the job but I am still looking for better protection. Hopefully, there are more when released in the States. Since the phone is unlocked, it will work with most carriers that follow the listed bands. I went into the MetroPCS store yesterday and tested it out, and it registered. Sketched to buy a phone online, but a lot of people who bought this phone before me like Daisy answered a lot of my questions. You won't regret buying this phone. Such a high quality, for a great price.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Really Good Phone...Beware of some nom-functional features. Size: 32GB (Dual-SIM) | Color: Black | Verified Purchase. This is a really good and stable phone, wish I could have gotten it in a 64gb configuration. Dual SIM feature works great, screen is great, very comfortable in the hand. Just one issue which I’ve noticed with it which is why I gave it 4/5 stars instead of 5/5. There seems to have been a flash of the firmware done in order to unlock it as it does not allow you to use samsung/android pay or turn on secret mode in samsung internet. I get an error saying the samsung/android pay is not supported on this device and when turning secret mode on in samsung internet I get an error saying rooting detected and secret mode can’t be used on rooted devices. I do not use this as my main phone so it doesn’t bother me much, but if you plan to use those features on this phone beware..

Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Great device but it doesn't work in Argentina for 4G. Size: 32GB (Dual-SIM) | Color: Black | Verified Purchase. This is an excellent device but it doesn't work in Argentina. The product description says that it is the version for US and Latin LTE. It says that the device covers the following bands: 4G LTE band B1 (2100), B2 (1900), B3 (1800), B4 (AWS), B5 (850), B7 (2600), B8 (900), B17 (700), B20 (800), B28 (700), B66 (AWS-3). Argentina uses bands 4 and 28, but the phone is not compatible with those bands. So, it works for 3G only. I have relied on the description of the product, however it does not seem to be real, at least if the device will be used in Argentina. I've received the phone in the hotel in the US and then, I went back to Argentina. Now, I have a great device but on 3G only. I'm going to write a complaint to Amazon to see if there is a possibility of a solution.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone, Quick Delivery. Size: 32GB (Dual-SIM) | Color: Pink | Verified Purchase. The phone arrived quickly and I was able to get it working very easily. The only problem is the Samsung Pay policies show only in Chinese. However, I can look them up online to see them in English. I live in the US and I was concerned because it was an International phone. All other functions give the option of using English and the phone work great! It looks great too! I love the Rose Gold color..

Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro review: Finally on the right path. Sleek design and Samsung Pay integration make the J7 Pro the company's best showing yet in the Galaxy J series.. Samsung has a long history of reusing components in its budget devices. It has done so to varying amounts of success in the past, and we've seen several models in the Galaxy J series running horribly outdated hardware. The Galaxy J lineup is now in its third generation, and Samsung is finally taking steps to address the issue.. Although the Galaxy J7 Pro is powered by the Exynos 7870 Octa —which made its debut in last year's J7 2016 — the company has rolled out updates in other areas — the phone has a 1080p panel, an all-new metallic chassis, 64GB of internal storage, Samsung Experience 8.1 UX based on Nougat , and Samsung Pay integration. The last point is crucial, as the J7 Pro is the first mid-range phone from Samsung to offer its digital payments service.. But is that enough to make the J7 Pro relevant in a segment that features the likes of the Redmi Note 4 and the Moto G5 Plus ? Let's find out.. I (Harish Jonnalagadda) am writing this review after using the Galaxy J7 Pro for two weeks in Hyderabad, India on Jio's 4G network. The phone was on the J730GMDXU1AQF9 build and the June 1, 2017 security patch, and didn't pick up any updates over the two weeks. The unit was provided to Android Central for review by Samsung India.. Samsung Experience 8.1 Android 7.0 Nougat. 5.5-inch Super AMOLED, 1920x1080 (401 ppi) AOD. Exynos 7870 Octa Octa-core 1.60GHz Cortex A53 cores. Wi-Fi ac, 4G with VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC,. One-touch fingerprint sensor at the front. 152.5 x 74.8 x 8.0mm 181g. Chinese manufacturers have been offering phones with all-metal designs for several generations now, but Samsung has been slow to incorporate it into its Galaxy J series. The J7 2016 featured a metal frame and a plastic back, and with the J7 Pro, we're finally getting an aluminum unibody design. The antenna bands are located at the top and bottom of the device, and they create a pattern that gives the J7 Pro a distinct flair when it comes to the design. The bands also offer a nice contrast to the overall color scheme, particularly with the gold color option.. The phone has sizeable bezels at the top and bottom, but Samsung did a good job of minimizing the side bezels. There's a home button up front with an embedded fingerprint sensor, and like last year's Galaxy S7 , you can double press the button to quickly launch the camera.. The power button is located on the right, and the volume buttons on the left, and all three buttons have decent tactile feedback. The 3.5mm jack is at the bottom, next to the Micro-USB charging port. More and more manufacturers are switching out to USB-C in this segment, but Samsung was reticent to move to the new standard for its flagships until this year, so it looks like we'll have to wait until next year to see USB-C ports on the company's budget devices.. In an interesting design choice, the speaker is located next to the power button. The speaker gets sufficiently loud, and its position means you won't accidentally cover it when holding the phone. Another thing the J7 Pro gets right is the SIM card tray. Unlike most phones in this segment, the J7 Pro has dedicated slots for two SIM cards and a microSD card.. The Galaxy J7 Pro is Samsung's best-looking budget by a country mile.. Samsung nailed everything from the build quality to the execution, and the result is that the J7 Pro feels and looks like a device priced twice as much. That's a big deal considering Samsung basically rolled out one uninspiring phone after another in this category thus far.. If you're wondering about the Pro moniker, the only difference between the standard J7 2017 and the J7 Pro is that the latter has 64GB storage and the aforementioned Samsung Pay. In all other areas, the J7 Pro is identical to the standard variant. As such, Samsung isn't going to release the J7 2017 in India, instead focusing on the J7 Pro to be the standard-bearer for the Galaxy J series this year.. Coming to the display, the J7 Pro offers a 5.5-inch Full HD Super AMOLED panel with a pixel density of 401ppi. The screen looks great, with excellent controls levels and color reproduction. it also gets sufficiently bright for outdoor viewing, and you also get the option to adjust the color temperature. A new feature in the J7 Pro is Always On Display, giving you quick access to the clock, calendar, and incoming notifications while the screen is off. You'll be able to set schedules for AOD and choose from four clock styles.. The J7 Pro has a sleek design and a great display, but it still features last year's Exynos 7870. The chipset isn't the fastest out there, and Samsung's decision to stick with it is particularly infuriating considering the phone has picked up sizeable upgrades in other areas. The Exynos 7870 just doesn't cut it anymore, and when you look at the fact that the J7 Pro is now pushing a Full HD panel, it makes it all the more annoying.. Even regular tasks like browsing the web on Chrome cause the phone to stutter. Although the Exynos 7870 has eight Cortex A53 cores, they're clocked up to a maximum of 1.6GHz. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 625 also has eight A53 cores, but they go up to 2.0GHz for the performance cluster.. Although the 14nm Exynos 7870 may not be the most powerful chipset in this segment, it is certainly frugal. The phone easily manages to last a day on a full charge thanks to the energy-efficient chipset and 3600mAh battery, and you can further extend battery life by enabling power saving modes.. The main drawback when it comes to battery life is the lack of a fast charging option — the J7 Pro takes an agonizing two hours to fully charge up.. The highlight of the J7 Pro is that it is the first phone in the budget category to feature the full-fledged version of Samsung Pay. Samsung's digital payments service works over NFC as well as the older MST standard, and as a result it requires proprietary hardware in the form of a metal coil located underneath the back plate. The hardware transmits information wirelessly to POS machines, essentially mimicking a card swipe.. Samsung Pay in India: Everything you need to know. That's the biggest advantage with Samsung Pay, and the fact that it is available on a phone that costs ₹20,900 makes it that much more accessible to a wider audience. And as Samsung claims, you really will be able to use Samsung Pay at most offline retailers. The payments service also offers the ability to transfer money over UPI, and you can link your Paytm wallet to add funds to your account with ease.. Samsung made several changes to its UX earlier this year, and we're seeing those improvements trickle into the budget segment with the J7 Pro. The phone features the latest Samsung Experience 8.1 atop Android 7.0 Nougat, and the overall experience is akin to what you'd find on a Galaxy S8.. The app drawer is accessible with a slide up or down gesture from anywhere on the home screen, but if you like the older implementation, there's a setting to enable the apps button. Doing so doesn't disable the swipe up/down gesture, however. Samsung's excellent Multi Window mode is present, as is the theming engine that lets you alter the overall look of the interface.. Other noteworthy features include a one-handed mode, blue light filter, display scaling options, Direct share, Secure Folder, and Samsung's device maintenance hub. There's also a Dual Messenger mode, which lets you run two instances of an app simultaneously. The UX also has new iconography, and a settings pane that's easier to navigate. Overall, Samsung has done a great job of bringing its latest UX to the budget device.. The imaging sensor used in the J7 Pro (Sony IMX258) is the same as that of the Redmi Note 4, and the camera quality is decidedly average. Like the rest of the software, the camera interface is near-identical to what you get on a Galaxy S8, including options to share your photos on social networks with ease.. When it comes to taking images, however, the J7 Pro is nowhere near as fluid as the Galaxy S8. The phone takes too long to focus on a subject, and it has a tendency to underexpose images. Manually enabling HDR fixes the problem, but it slows down the device down even further. As for low-light imagery, most shots I took just ended up coming muddy and full of noise.. Galaxy J7 Pro Bottom line. Samsung Pay is a marquee feature, and it's great that Samsung is bringing its payments service to the budget segment. While the rest of the additions make the J7 Pro the best device yet in the Galaxy J series, it doesn't hold up very well when compared to the competition. The budget segment is fiercely contested in India, and there are plenty of great alternatives in this category that cost nearly half as much and offer more value for your money.. Samsung's brand cachet means it doesn't have to go up against the likes of Xiaomi, and for the most part, that has worked in previous years. Xiaomi has catered to the online segment, while Samsung leveraged its robust distribution network to push millions of units of phones. However, ready availability of the Redmi Note 4 at thousands of retail stores across the country has cut into Samsung's margins, and as mainstream consumers become more aware of brands like Xiaomi and Huawei, Samsung needs to alter its strategy in this segment.. With the J7 Pro, the company has shown that it can be cognizant of consumers' needs. But by reusing components from last year, Samsung made the overall experience worse. Were it not for the older Exynos 7870 chipset, the J7 Pro would have been one of the best devices in the ₹20,000 segment, particularly considering it is the only phone in this category to feature Samsung Pay..

Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (79). Samsung Android Dual SIM. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro key features:. Screen: 5.5" 1080p Super AMOLED screen (401ppi); Always On Display. OS: Android 7.0 Nougat; Samsung Experience 8.1. Chipset: 14nm octa-core Exynos 7870 (8 x 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53 cores). Memory: 3GB of RAM; 32/64GB storage, dedicated microSD slot for expansion. Camera: Primary 13MP, f/1.7, LED flash; Secondary 13MP, f/1.9, LED flash. Connectivity: nano SIM (dual SIM version available); LTE (Cat. 6); dual-band Wi-Fi ac; Bluetooth 4.2; FM Radio; microUSB; 3.5mm jack. Misc: Fingerprint reader, Samsung Pay. Same GPU as the J7 (2016), yet twice as many pixels on the screen. microUSB port isn't the least bit Pro. 2017 for some, Pro for others - seemingly identical Galaxies come in a number of different, market-specific flavors this year, and we now have the Galaxy J7 Pro for review. An offshoot of the ever-growing J7 family, the Pro is meant for India, South East Asia and Brazil, each of these getting a (very slightly) further localized version.. We'll be reviewing the J730GM/DS version, the GM signifying it's the one for India if you're to blindly trust Samsung's websites. As the DS lettering indicates, it's a dual SIM phone.. The rest of the Galaxy J7 Pro is very much like the J7 (2017), which we've already reviewed. You're getting a Super AMOLED 5.5-inch display with pixels galore - alright, it's FullHD, but most of last year's J7s were 720p. Coming straight from last year is the chipset, but then the 14nm Exynos 7870 was ahead of its time back then - for a midrange SoC, that is - so it still makes sense in 2017 and will probably remain relevant in 2018, too.. Our review unit comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but 64GB versions are also available. You can theoretically save some cash and get this 32GB version, as there's a microSD slot, fully dedicated one at that so you won't be sacrificing the second SIM slot.. We weren't exactly thrilled about the camera when we reviewed the J7 (2017), but it got the job done, and the Pro receives the same 13MP f/1.7 setup. For selfies, you're also getting 13MP resolution and a flash.. With all the good stuff the Galaxy J7 Pro shares with the J7 (2017), there's no escaping the cons. For one, the sizeable 3,600mAh battery will take ages to fill up without any fast charging. And the power-efficient chipset isn't all too powerful, particularly in the graphics department - the Galaxy J7 (2016) could get away with it since it's got a lower-res display, but the FullHD displays of this year's J7s would be happier with a bit more oomph.. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro press images. And the one that seems the easier bit to resolve - the microUSB port used on the Galaxy J7 Pro should have been USB-C to keep up with the times. But hey, you can't have it all, it seems.. We'll be unboxing the Galaxy J7 Pro on the next page, followed by the usual assessment of the design and controls. Hit that 'Next page' and let's get going.. Unboxing, 360-degree spin, hardware overview 3. Telephony, loudspeaker, text input, other apps 7. Final thoughts, key test findings, alternatives, verdict.

Design: Looks Good and Feels Good Display: A Shining Display Hardware and Performance Software: A Step Ahead Camera: Less Than Impressive Battery Life: A True Performer My Say. The Galaxy J series smartphones have been a favorite among Indian consumers for quite some time. This can be attributed to the fact that even an entry-level Samsung phone is worth its money. Joining closely in the wake of the successful lineup. is the new budget phone — the Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro .. Launched alongside the Galaxy J7 Max, the Galaxy J7 Pro is priced at Rs. 20,900 and boasts a Super AMOLED screen in a stylish new setting.. It also is touted for its Social Camera features which have been developed in Bangalore, India as part of the Make in India campaign.. So, let’s see how the Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro fares for a budget device.. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro Pros and Cons: Should You Buy It?. The Samsung J7 Pro is an apt successor to the Samsung J7 lineup. f you recollect the Galaxy J7 Prime was quite popular with the Indian masses. At 5.5-inches it packs a metal unibody with beautifully curved corners similar to the Galaxy A7. Unlike a few recent phones , the antenna lines are proudly displayed on the rear giving the smooth rear a stylish finish.. The rear camera lens and the LED flash is flush fitted in an oval backdrop, which not only lends an aesthetic appeal but also brings about a symmetric look. At 7.9-mm thickness, this member of the Samsung Galaxy J7 family is easy in the hands and feels premium at the same time.. Speaking of the design, you’ll find the power button on the right, just below the speaker grills. The change in the placement of the speaker grills is an interesting design change as opposed to the standard layout at the bottom, thus preventing sounds and audio from getting muffled by the hands.. The speakers grill on the side is another clever design aspect.. On the left, you’ll find the volume rockers, SIM slots and a separate slot for the SD card. I particularly liked this design as it gives you the independence to use the dual SIM cards (nano+nano) and the memory card simultaneously.. The fingerprint sensor is located on the chin flanked on either side by the recent button and back button. The buttons are tactile and respond well.. Similar to its high-end cousins, Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy Note8, the J7 Pro has also retained its headphone jack.. Though it’s 2017, the Galaxy J7 Pro is still fitted with a micro USB charging port. At a time, when the smartphone and gadget world is adopting the universal USB Type-C charging ports, the micro USB charging port seems a tad disappointing.. Given that even the budget offerings from Xiaomi like the Mi Max 2 or the Mi A1 have switched over to USB Type-C, hopefully, the upcoming version of the Samsung J7 series makes the jump.. Overall, the Galaxy J7 Pro looks good and feels good but isn’t fragile at the same time. A drop from a height of around 5 foot didn’t even leave a scratch, let alone a dent. However, do remember to mount a protective cover before your luck runs out.. Bezel-less displays are the new big thing. are getting wider and those dark areas are being sent packing. And keeping up with this trend is the Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro. The thinner bezels give an illusion of an even wider screen to this 5.5-inch screen phone.. Displays are one of the major strength of Samsung and the J7 Pro does full justice to this statement. The Super AMOLED screen of the J7 Pro feels amazingly bright, vivid and crisp with accurate color reproductions.. This is one of the premium phones from the Samsung Galaxy J7 stable since it's one of the first entry-level phones to sport the Always on Display feature. This feature is customizable and leaves no stones unturned when it comes to displaying incoming messages and notifications.. What I liked about this phone is the built-in Blue light filter. The switch is easily accessible through the Quick Settings menu.. Coming to the sunlight legibility, the Galaxy J7 Pro stands it grounds even under harsh sunlight. This was quite surprising since even the high-end phones like OnePlus 5 goes for a dive under sunlight.. The device is fueled by the midrange 1.6 GHz Exynos 7870 octa-core (Cortex-A53) processor, similar to the Samsung J7 prime (2016).. Coming to the RAM, this mobile phone packs 3 GB RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. This internal memory is expandable through a microSD card up to 256 GB and the dedicated memory card slot is the cherry on top.. The 7870 octa-core processor — comparable to the Snapdragon 625 — manages to sail through most o the regular activities with ease. But when it comes to hardcore processing, you might encounter a tiny lag here and there.. And this leads us to the topic of gaming. While most of the casual games like Mario Run or Township can be played easily, it’s with the high graphic games that the performance drop is significant.. For instance, Asphalt 8 in the higher graphic settings encountered significant frame drops.. Moving onto benchmark scores, the AnTuTu benchmarking tool clocked a score of 46358 which is just a decent for this. If I were to compare it to the Moto G5 Plus, which is around four thousand bucks. less, it scored an impressive 63342 points.. On the temperature front, it tends to get unusually hot at times, even the app which you may be using be as simple as a news app. However, as noted above, it’s not always.. Speaking of the fingerprint sensor, the turnaround time is excellent. Initially, I was a bit skeptical about it, being a. long-standing admirer of OnePlus 3/3T’s fingerprint sensor, however, the Galaxy J7 Pro has left me impressed with its accuracy and response time.. The J7 Max and J7 Pro are one of the few budget devices from Samsung which has come packed with Android Nougat 7.0 in 2017. If you recollect, even the mid-tier Galaxy A5 or the C7 Pro released with Android Marshmallow.. Well, that’s a plus point here. Typical of all Samsung smartphones, Android Nougat is based on the in-house TouchWiz which means that there are plenty of features built-in.. For one, you have a smart device maintenance tool, a couple of nifty features like Lock and mask apps, Dual Messenger, Secure Folder, among others.. The highlight of the hour is Samsung Pay.. Standing up starkly among these features is Samsung Pay, which uses NFC (near field communication) or MST (magnetic field communication) to communicate the transaction details.. Launched in March this year, it lets you make cashless and cardless transactions using your smartphone. Since this technology works with both NFC and MST-enabled PoS devices, using Samsung Pay in India is a breeze.. But for a device priced at Rs. 20,900, the Galaxy J7 Pro lacks one basic feature — scrollable screenshots .. When this feature is a basic ask, even found in devices priced as low as Rs. 6,999 ( Xiaomi Redmi 4 ) and this is just one of the examples.. Apart from Samsung Pay, the second important feature is the camera, rather the Social Camera. But before, we get down to it, let’s go through the specs first. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro is fitted with two 13-megapixel cameras. at the front and at the back.. And the highlight of the rear 13-megapixel camera is the aperture. A wide aperture of f/1.7 means bright and vivid pictures and true to it, the J7 Pro manages to capture pictures which are crisp in normal lighting conditions.. But when it comes to color reproductions, the results are a tad washed out.. The following are some of the pictures shot using the Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro.. However, low-light photography is a true test for any camera and unfortunately, the J7 Pro fails at it miserably. For one, the focus just doesn’t seem to sit right, resulting in pictures which are blurry and grainy.. This drawback seems especially bad for a phone which has been marketed to capture great pictures in low-light conditions.. Another sore spot is the macro focus. The primary camera struggles to focus on objects and more often than not, you will land up with a blurry shot. This situation can be averted if the distance between the object and the camera is increased, but then, the meaning of Macro. On the bright side, the camera has its usual share of Snapchat-like filters (initially seen in the Galaxy S8), stickers and a beauty mode.. These built-in stickers ensure that you end up downloading fewer photo editing apps from the Google Play Store.. Going back to the Social Camera , it’s a great feature to have provided it lets you click and share in a jiffy. All you have to do is add your Facebook and WhatsApp details and you are good to go.. On the contrary, the selfie shooter of the J7 Pro pulled off an impressive performance with the front flash acting as the ever helpful wingman.. All in all, the camera performance was less than impressive and was a big let down, especially when it came to color reproduction and setting the focus.. Battery life can make or break a phone and thankfully the J7 Pro is equipped with a good battery and great optimization techniques. Galaxy J7 Pro is powered by a 3600 mAh battery that will easily see you through a whole day and more, in case of regular usage.. The built-in battery optimization plays a great role in maximizing the battery life. While, if you are a heavy user, it will last you through a day. Aforesaid, the built-in battery optimization plays a great role in maximizing the battery life in the J7 Pro. While the app power monitor or the power saving modes are not really new, they play their part well in preserving the juice.. However, this is let down by the charging technique. The Galaxy J7 Pro sports neither Fast Charge nor. So, to charge the J7 Pro, you’ll need to shell out a couple of hours to charge it to the fullest.. Moreover, the charger that comes with the J7 Pro shells out an output of 5V and 1.55A instead of the standard output of 5V and 2A, found in most of the smartphones in this price range.. Overall, the Samsung J7 Pro can be seen as a great addition to the Samsung J series with its stylish design, Super AMOLED display, build quality, support for 4G LTE and a decent battery life. Plus, it lets you stick two nano SIM card together, along with a microSD card, thanks to the dedicated slots.. But then, it’s the price which is a tad much considering the average camera performance and a mediocre processor.. At a time when the Indian smartphone market is flooded with phones like the Xiaomi Mi A1, Gionee A1 or he Huawei Honor 8 Lite at a comparatively lesser price, it remains to be seen whether the Galaxy J7 Pro is able to beat the competition with the brand name alone.. And hey, don’t forget to get the protective cover. Better to be safe than sorry, right?. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro vs Moto G5 Plus: Which One Should You Buy?. Last updated on 8 Feb, 2018.

Mobiles / Samsung Mobile Phones / Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 12,286 Compare. The South Korean handset maker, Samsung now has an established lineup of budget, mid-range and high-end smartphones. The Galaxy J series from the brand is intended for those who are looking for a budget device that would also perform well. This lineup is now all set to enter its third generation and there has never been more anticipated lineup before. However, Samsung is also launching different variants of J series handsets as well, to provide options to its buyers. Here is a brief overview of the Galaxy J7 Pro, which comes with a good front camera and powerful spec sheet under INR 20,000.. Powerful front camera : One of the most used feature of any smartphone is to click selfies and the front camera is a necessity for many. This is why Samsung has equipped this handset with a powerful 13 Megapixels snapper on the front. Galaxy J7 Pro comes with 13 megapixels cameras on both front and rear panel, which is quite appealing to smartphone photography enthusiasts.. Helio P20 Processor : Samsung is now making a shift from usual Snapdragon to MediaTek processors in its smartphone, It is expected that the upcoming device would come flaunting MediaTek Helio P0 processor, which is an Octa-core processor that has been clocked at 2.3 GHZ and is designed to perform like a champ.. Brilliant display : The best thing about the handset has to be the display though, which measures 5.7-inch diagonally and comes with the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Therefore, it is a delight to use the display for multimedia and gaming purpose.. Dull resolution : While the display of the handset is certainly a talking point, however, there is a slight drawback. The massive size of the display and the resolution used, results in a pixel density of 386 PPI. This means that the display is usually sharp indoors and at night but might struggle in direct sunlight. However, we personally feel that this is not much of a deal breaker..

Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Review- The Beast!. Honor 9 Lite Review- An Excellent Package!. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime Review- Old Wine, Old Bottle!. Honor View 10 Review- An Excellent Flagship Experience for the Price. Mobile Phones Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro Review- The Best J Series Ever. Design and Build: Display: Software: Performance: Camera: Battery: Verdict:. Published on August 8, 2017. A few months back, Samsung announced two mid-range J series phones in India, the J7 Max, and J7 Pro. We have already reviewed the J7 Max on this blog. The J7 Pro is the slightly costlier version that the J7 Max and it comes with a 5.5 inch Super AMOLED display and is powered by Exynos 7870 Octa core chipset with 3GB RAM and 64GB storage. This is also the first J series with Samsung Pay support. So how does the phone perform in this segment?. Let’s find out in this Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro Review.. While most of the J series phones so far have looked similar, Samsung has done a bit of tweaking with the J7 Pro design and it now resembles the new A series in terms of design. With tapered edges and rounded corners, the J7 Pro looks great. It has an all metal unibody construction and the two antenna lines on the rear panel have been given a good integration making the overall design look good. It is definitely the best looking J series phone so far and we liked the black color of the device. The rear panel has a matte finish and looks premium.. The rear panel has the 13MP camera and LED flash along with Samsung logo. The right side houses the speaker and power button while the volume keys are on the left side along with the two SIM card slots. At the bottom panel, you get the charging and data syncing slot along with 3.5mm audio jack. The front panel has a 13MP camera, LED flash and the usual set of sensors. Below the 5.5 inch display is the physical home button which also doubles up as the fingerprint scanner. There is two capacitive touch button, unfortunately, they are not backlit.. The J7 Pro gives a good feeling when holding it in hand and definitely looks good.. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro comes with a 5.5 inch Super AMOLED Full HD display with 1080p resolution. AMOLED panels always provide brighter colors and J7 Pro is no exception. The color quality looks really good on the J7 Pro with good viewing angles and outdoor visibility. Since it has the light sensor, the overall brightness levels are also good. It has 2.5D curved glass which adds some premium looks to the phone, but unfortunately, there is no protection offered on the display.. Overall, the display is vivid, crisp and sharp and look good.. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro comes with the new UI from Samsung which was available on S8 and S8+. The new UI feels a lot better and looks fresh. It has a custom UI with an option of having multiple home screens without an app drawer or you can even switch to app drawer from the home settings. The settings panel is also has a custom UI. The notification center and quick toggles have also been changed and there is an option to change the layout of the toggles.. Since the phone comes with a SUPER AMOLED display, you can also select the color temperature of the display and also select from the different screen modes available.. The phone comes with a bunch of additional settings which includes the ability to lock and hide apps, one handed UI, multi window, quick launching camera, smart alert and more. The phone also features Dual Messenger feature which is basically the dual apps on other OEMs. Here, you can run two instances of messenger apps like Facebook , WhatsApp, Skype etc. The list of supported apps will be available when you install the app.. J7 Pro also features Samsung’s security apps like S Secure and Secure folder which are found on all Samsung phones for privacy and locking apps. You can also use the fingerprint scanner to lock apps. The phone also comes with a panic mode where you can make an emergency call or sent SOS. It also features Samsung’s existing options like Easy mode and support for themes, wallpapers and icons.. One of the important features of the device is the support for Samsung Pay. This is the first J series phone which comes with support for Samsung Pay and NFC feature. You can add debit or credit card to the Samsung Pay account and make it as a wallet for payment.. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro is powered by the Exynos 7870 Octa Core processor and is coupled with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The Exynos 7870 is a decent mid range chipset and we have seen it on quite a few devices released in India including J7 Nxt. In day to day tasks, the device was a response and there was hardly any issues, but when you push it a bit harder with heavy tasks running in the background, you can some minor hiccups. But nevertheless, the performance was quite good on the phone. The gaming performance of the device was also decent and there were no heating issues on the phone.. The Exynos 7870 is not as powerful as the Snapdragon 625 which powers quite a lot of devices in this segment including Redmi Note 4, Lenovo P2 and also Zenfone 3.. The phone comes with 64GB of internal storage and you get close to 54GB of storage on first boot. There is also an option to expand the storage using the dedicated SD card slot available. The call quality of the device was good, but the speaker located on the right side was average in performance. It was not the loudest one for music playback.. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro sports a 13MP rear camera with f/1.7, auto focus, LED flash and a 13MP front camera with f/1.9 and LED flash. The camera interface on the device is mostly similar to what we have seen on Galaxy S8, but few features are missing. It comes with good set of options and social camera where in you can quickly edit the pictures and upload it to your favorite social site right from the camera interface. The front camera also comes with a wide selfie, sound and shot and also the social camera integration.. Talking about the camera quality, we found the day light shots taken with the camera to have decent quality including detailing, but the color quality was a slight let down when you compare with J7 Max. The overall clarity of the photos looked quite decent. The close-up images also came out well except for the focusing issue which is not a major con but there are some issues in focus. The low light images taken with the device also was decent quality and with f/1.7 the overall clarity was good. The selfies taken with the 13MP front camera was impressive and had good colors and also decent dynamic range and overall we feel this is definitely one of the good selfie cameras in this price segment. Here are some of the samples taken with the device.. J7 Pro packs a 3600mAh battery capacity and we tested the battery life in daily usage with calls, browsing, gaming, using the camera and also for social networking. With mixed usage, we could easily get more than a day of usage with almost close to 4- 4.5 hours of screen on time. Unfortunately, there is no fast charging included in the device even with the bigger capacity battery.. So how good it the J7 Pro for Rs 20,990? While the J7 Pro comes with a good design and build, good AMOLED display, improved UI, Samsung Pay support and bigger battery, the pricing for the device is on the higher side. The device comes with only a budget chipset, the Exynos 7870 for this price segment.. If you are in the market for a J series phone, then this is the best you can buy till date. But if you want a more affordable smartphone, then you should be looking at Zenfone 3, Lenovo P2 or the Redmi Note 4 with slightly better hardware and lower price.. Pros Design and Build AMOLED display Software Battery Life Samsung Pay. Cons Price Rear Camera Performance No Display Protection Exynos 7870 is not Powerful.

News Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro, Galaxy J7 Max hands-on and first impressions. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro, Galaxy J7 Max hands-on and first impressions. Samsung’s new Galaxy J7 Pro and Galaxy J7 Max are banking on their payment and social features to succeed. Published: June 14, 2017 5:40 PM IST. Samsung says Galaxy J is its most popular series among buyers in India. In fact, it claims that one in every four Samsung smartphone sold in the country is a part of the Galaxy J series. Earlier today, the company added two new devices to the series — Galaxy J7 Pro and Galaxy J7 Max. Priced at Rs 20,900 and Rs 17,900 respectively, the smartphones will be going on sale later this month. At the launch event today, I spent sometime with both the smartphones, and here are my first impressions.. In a time of cut-throat competition in the smartphone space, Samsung is banking on two specific features to help the Galaxy J7 Pro and Galaxy J7 Max stand out. Initially restricted to flagship devices like the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, the Galaxy J7 Pro is the first affordable device to get this payment feature. With the Galaxy J7 Max though, the company is introducing a new feature called Samsung Pay mini.. As the name suggests, this new feature is a toned down version of Samsung Pay , and it is designed to work with smartphones that do not have the NFC or MST chips. Unlike Samsung Pay though, the Pay mini will only let users conduct online transactions using UPI or virtual wallets. Going forward, Samsung will be rolling out this feature on its other devices via a software update. For a device to be eligible to get Pay mini however, it will need to have a fingerprint sensor. Samsung Pay Mini vs Samsung Pay: What is the difference?. The other notable feature Samsung spent time talking about is social camera. In essence, this feature adds a social element to the native camera app. So you get selfie filters that you normally get on apps like Snapchat and Instagram, augmented reality stickers to paste on your photos, and the ability to instantly share the photos you click on different social media accounts or messaging apps. In the short time I spent using the feature, it came across as a tad gimmicky. That said, I would reserve my judgment until I have extensively tested the feature in our review.. These features apart, you get the standard Android experience from both the new devices. In terms of design, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro is a huge step above the Galaxy J7 Max. The smartphone is quite sleek with rounded edges, and despite the 5.5-inch display, it sits comfortably in your palms. The antenna bands get a distinct curved pattern on the top and bottom edges. The rear camera module too is a tad different from what we have seen on recent Samsung devices.. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Max , on the other hand, features a very generic candybar design. A similar design is seen on many of the smartphones we see in the market these days. With a 5.7-inch display, the device also felt a bit too big to hold comfortably — especially for someone with average-sized palms like me. The only standout feature in terms of design is the smart glow ring around the rear camera. This LED strip basically lights up when you get a notification. Up front, both devices have a physical home button flanked by capacitive navigation buttons. The home button also doubles up as a fingerprint sensor.. Both smartphones come with a full HD (1080p) resolution display, but only the Galaxy J7 Pro comes with a Super AMOLED panel. Under ambient lighting conditions at the launch event, the display of both the devices was bright enough, and text looked sharp as well. The 2.5D curved glass on both the devices not only add a layer of protection, but also a dash of premium-ness.. Under the hood, both devices are powered by an octa-core SoC. But where the Galaxy J7 Pro is powered by an Exynos SoC, the Galaxy J7 Max is powered by a MediaTek SoC. The Galaxy J7 Pro comes with 3GB of RAM and 64GB storage that can be expanded using a microSD card. The Galaxy J7 Max, on the other hand, comes with 4GB RAM, and 32GB expandable internal storage. A noteworthy point here is that both devices come with three different slots for SIM and microSD cards. This is any day the prefered choice over the hybrid setup, which has been increasingly opted by Chinese companies. Top 5 Samsung smartphones you can buy under Rs 20,000. The two smartphones also share the same photographic capabilities. There is a 13-megapixel f/1.7 snapper at the back, and a 13-megapixel f/1.9 snapper at the front. There’s also a front-facing flash, which helps in clicking selfies in low light conditions. In the short time spent with the devices, I couldn’t really find anything to complain about. But we will reserve our final judgment until we have reviewed the devices.. The Galaxy J7 Pro comes with a 3,600mAh battery, while the Galaxy J7 Max comes with a 3,300mAh battery. Both the units are said to be good enough to last the day. The smartphones also run on Android Nougat out-of-the-box wrapped under Samsung’s custom UI. 5 Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro alternatives you can buy. In the time I spent with the two devices, there was barely anything to complain about. Both are well built, boast a good design (Galaxy J7 Pro), and have a decent set of specifications and features. The Samsung Pay, and Pay mini options on both the devices is also a bonus. But at the end of the day, what lets the smartphones down is the relatively high price tag, especially when compared to the current standards. Whether you should buy the Galaxy J7 Pro or the Galaxy J7 Max, is a question that we will only be able to answer when we extensively review them.
