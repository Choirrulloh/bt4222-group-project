But as a part of the deal, TCL communication could still use the brand name Alcatel One Touch. Now the company is run by TCL Mobile Limited (former name: T&A Mobile Phones Limited) which is a member of TCL Communication and was established in August 2004 by TCL Communication and Alcatel. This company manages three different business units: ALCATEL Mobile Phones, TCL Mobile Phones and Brand Design Lab..

The Alcatel X1 is a high-caliber 5-inch HD Android that sandwiches its specs between a 2.5D Dragontrail cover glass up front and a Gorilla Glass backing (also 2.5D-curved). Its 6.99mm-slim shell is home to the EyeVerify eye pattern recognition technology, a split-eight-core MSM8929 processor with 2GB of RAM, and a 13-megapixel rear camera rigged with a dual-tone LED flash. It also features a 5-megapixel flash-equipped Ultra Pixel frontal camera and a Hi-Fi audio system decked out with the Cirrus Logic and the Arkamys Acoustic Enhancement technologies. This LTE-ready Android relies on a sub-average 2150mAh battery power, which we find quite uncharacteristic of a 2016 high-end release.. Also called Alcatel 7053D, Alcatel X-1.. Eyeprint recognition and dual 2.5D glass layers are among the Alcatel X1's strong suits. Get to know more in our pros-and-cons analysis here. View all the newest and upcoming Alcatel phones..

Smartphone Alcatel One Touch X1 - Recensione Caratteristiche Prezzo Source: Smartphone e tablet android IT→EN Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 09/05/2016 Rating: performance: 70% display: 70% mobility: 70% workmanship: 70%. This is a typical smartphone diagonal.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. The former French manufacturer of telecommunication equipment merged to Alcatel-Lucent in 2006. Several business segments were sold to other companies, so the Alcatel brand is now used by various companies. The Chinese company TCL uses the brand names "Alcatel One Touch" and "Alcatel Idol" for smartphones and tablets.. The market share in the smartphone + tablet segment is very small, but there are quite some recent reviews in different languages. The ratings are average (as of 2016)..
