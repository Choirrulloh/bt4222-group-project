Esto también se puede leer en español.. A budget Windows Phone with comfortable curves. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Nokia Lumia 735 is comfy to hold, with colourful, interchangeable cases and a good screen. The Bad Its camera doesn't impress, its processor doesn't provide enough power for demanding tasks, and its Windows Phone app store still receives little attention from developers.. The Bottom Line Although the Lumia 735 doesn't have the best camera, it's colourful, curvy and comfortable, has a good display and an affordable price -- all of which go a long way to making up for it.. It's a time of massive change for Nokia as the ink has finally dried on Microsoft's takeover of the Finnish firm. Although new Microsoft Lumia phones will arrive without the Nokia brand anywhere to be seen, the Lumia 735 and its pricier brother the 830 were the last of the Nokia line.. The Lumia 735 is a 4.7-inch phone with colourful, interchangeable cases, a 720p display and the latest version of Windows Phone 8.1. The Lumia 735 has 4G LTE and is on sale now in the UK for free on contracts starting at £14.50 per month, or SIM-free from Microsoft for £189.. A US launch has yet to be confirmed (it could well appear under a different name, exclusive to a particular carrier), but the £189 UK price converts to roughly $300. In Australia, Microsoft Devices has said that pricing and availability will be "made available closer to local sales start"; the UK price converts to AU$340.. It's joined by the Lumia 730, which is physically identical, except for dual-SIM card capability and 3G-only radio. The 730 will go on sale in "select markets where dual-SIM phones are important".. If you've ever clapped eyes on Nokia's older Lumia 800 , the 735 will be familiar. Like the 800, it has a one-piece polycarbonate plastic back that curves around to meet the screen. It's very comfortable to hold -- particularly given its fairly palm-friendly 4.7-inch size.. Unlike the 800, however, the plastic case is removable, allowing you to swap it out if you fancy changing the colour of the phone, or if your existing case is starting to look battered and you want a fresh one. It comes in bright green and orange colours, or you can stick to the less garish white and black versions if you prefer.. It feels very comfortable to hold, as the plastic back curves sweetly against your hand. I think it looks good too -- I loved the curved design of the Lumia 800 and I'm very happy to see its return, albeit in a larger version.. The phone comes with 8GB of built-in storage, but if you like to keep your photos, music and videos saved locally to your phone, you'll quickly find yourself running out of space. There's a microSD card slot hidden beneath the case, however, so you can expand the storage. I suggest transferring over all your music and videos to save space on the phone for your apps.. The display is 4.7 inches on the diagonal, giving a good amount of room for texting or a spot of Netflix on the go, without making it too cumbersome to use. It's far from the thumb-stretching proportions of the 6.5-inch Lumia 1520. It has a 720p resolution, which is a step down from the full HD panels you'll find on many phones -- including the Lumia 930 -- but given the much lower price of the 735, it's very much forgivable.. For most things you'll want the phone for, the resolution is more than adequate. Windows' live tiles have sharp edges, text is crisp and high-resolution photos look fine -- although without the same clarity you'll find on higher resolution panels. The colours are rich too and the deep black levels provide good contrast.. The display is more than good enough for everyday tasks such as tweeting, emailing and stalking your friends on Facebook. If you want a phone to show off your photo gallery in glorious high definition, you might want to splash out on a bigger, full HD display. For the price though, the 735's display is certainly among the best.. The Lumia 735 uses the latest Windows Phone 8.1 software, with its cheery live tiles and newly added notifications bar. Even better, it comes with the latest update, codenamed Denim, which brings a bunch of new features into the mix.. Chief among these is Cortana , Windows Phone's Siri-like voice assistant, which is finally available in the UK and China after launching in the US. Denim also allows you to create folders on your homescreen for your live app tiles, which will still show live scrolling information.. I'm quite keen on Windows Phone. It's easy to use and looks good too. Its main drawback is still its app support, though. Although many of the bigger names are found on its shelves (Instagram, Spotify and Netflix are present and correct), it's usually later to receive new apps than iOS or Android -- if it receives them at all -- so it's not great if you like trying out the latest games and services with your friends.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News. Homeland Security's tall order: A hacker-free election. 'Annihilation' director wove memory into a dream-like movie.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars 4.5 not a bad phone...exceptionally awesome design.. Probably the best windows phone for the price and features. The resolution of the screen is technically HD, and the colors are vibrant but I do keep the brightness on low so I have the chance to save battery life. Not that its an issue, the battery on this thing is very strong. Under heavy video streaming I ran out of juice in just under 8 episodes of Burn Notice. The real way to burn it up is by playing games. I got somewhere past 4 hours on Spartan Assault. The battery knocks it out of the park on standby, 9 hours of almost no use only knocked it down by 3%. As far as performance I dont use very many intense apps. It seems to do just fine. Fastest startup time I ever had was 18 seconds. I also dont take much storage space but if you do I recommed sliding in an SD card and back that card up. I cant express to you how nice and solid this phone feels in hand. I dont even use the case i have for it because I dont drop it without the case. I was at first a bit skeptical about build quality because the back cover is removable but the shape and materials look and feel amazing.. I'm not a photo/video shooting expert but, I do enjoy the camera quite a lot. The shutter isnt mindblowing but not every pic i take is a dud. I have been able to take some great shots in the 2 months I have owned it. There are a few things I dont like though. Right out of the box I noticed that in the Theme settings I can not have only 2 rows of live tiles as I prefer. I guess it's just the way of this phones OS. Another annoyance was that Netflix will sometimes refuse some sort of playback file but will somehow work the next week. Oh, be careful that you might have to get a new sim card. While this version is unlocked and takes many carriers, it requires a nano sim card rather than a micro sim. I was a little surprised by that. Overall this is my favorite phone I have had. Now I just need a wireless charger. Ps...dont expect much from the speaker in back. I have headphones and bluetooth speakers to accomodate for this.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars A fantastic phone for the money.. I bought this phone only a week-or-so ago because my 620 of about 3 years broke and it seemed like the most reasonably priced upgrade/replacement, as well as being a much newer phone than my old one and from what I read, one of the best Lumia's around in terms of spec! It's a fantastic little phone that does everything I need it to do. I'm not really into taking pictures, but I did test the camera and video out, and it's amazing quality, and you also have plenty of pre-installed photo editing apps if you wish to use those. Its 4G internet is VERY fast, and I'm lucky enough to have 4G almost all the time because of where I live, which is a bonus! It's got a very good screen - which I expected from Lumia anyway as my old one was fantastic too - the battery life is great for someone who isn't constantly attached to their phone like me (if you're a heavy phone user it may run out a lot faster, as someone I know has the same phone and she's always moaning about it, but she's always on social media and listening to music on it), it's also a very nice, slim design which fits in my pocket perfectly and is nice to hold in your hand -- it's very light and not too intrusive when you're carrying it around in your pockets. It's also got the other features you'd expect form a windows phone such as one drive, email apps, cortana and other great OEM applications that are very useful and in my experience, reliable to a fault! My only criticism of this phone is that it can occasionally be temperamental and sometimes when you're using the IE browser on it, it goes off on a tangent doing its own thing and you end up having to either refresh altogether or just rectify "your" mistake, also removing the battery cover can be a bit tricky because it's quite a long phone (compared to my old one) and you probably will catch the buttons on the side. Also, when I first got the phone I wasn't used to the fact you had to slide the Windows buttons up on the screen to use them, as my old one had them on the front of the phone itself, whereas these are on the screen in a toolbar format -- however, you soon get used to this and using the buttons becomes 2nd nature. Overall though I am glad I chosen the 735: If you want a very reliable phone that's very user-friendly, a nice looking phone and not ridiculously priced (like the 830 with not much of a difference in spec, and is a whole 1 month newer than the 735(!) and a few hundred quid more for the privilege), I'd recommend this one.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great phone.. I purchased this phone at a Verizon store a couple of days ago. I joined the Microsoft insider program so the phone immediately updated to Windows 10. Updated perfectly to 10 and has been very stable. My last phone was the 928. The 735 has user replaceable battery and user can put in a micro SD up to 128gb.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars A good mid-range 4G phone and a selfie specialist. PROS: -Smart, colourful design -Good low-light photos -Great for selfies and group shots -Bursting with features CONS: -Sluggish in some games -Slightly grainy, oversaturated screen -No HDR camera mode -Weak built-in speaker Its problems lie in sluggish performance in games and the fact I'd be tempted by cheaper Android alternatives, such as this one: [...]. Was this review helpful to you?. Everything about this phone is just plain terrible. OS- For starters, it is a Windows phone which means it's the worst operating system for smart phones available. 1.0 out of 5 stars What a God-awful Phone. The phone uses Windows 8 and yet it is not able to sync with Outlook. My Blackberry did this with the included software and it is not connected to Microsoft. 1.0 out of 5 stars Worst smartphone you can buy. Pros:- 4.7" 720p (316 ppi) 16M-color ClearBlack AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Gorilla Glass 3 Microsoft Windows Phone 8. 4.0 out of 5 stars Golden mean.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 8 GB + MicroSD. View all photos (64). Click to read the full review. Based on 7 User reviews. Too little RAM memory (1 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (312 ppi). The Nokia Lumia 735 comes with a mission: it is advertised as a 'selfie' phone, one with higher-res front-facing camera to allow you taking even better pictures of yourself. It's a 5-megapixel front shooter with a wide-angle lens that does that, plus, the phone has also got a 6.7-megapixel rear camera. For all else, this is a fairly typical Windows Phone 8.1 mid-ranger for late-2014: it's got a 4.7" 720p ClearBlack OLED display, Snapdragon 400 system chip, 1GB of RAM, and 8 gigs of internal storage. The difference with the otherwise almost identical Lumia 730 is that the 735 features 4G LTE connectivity and only one SIM card.. Microsoft Lumia 735 Review Nokia Lumia 735 manual Nokia Lumia 735 benchmarks. OS: Windows Phone, 8.1, UI. Dimensions: 5.30 x 2.70 x 0.35 inches (134.7 x 68.5 x 8.9 mm). Weight: 4.74 oz (134 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 4.7 inches. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Night mode, Scenes. Features: Continuous autofocus, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 22.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 27.0 days (648 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 17.70 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 3, 7, 20. Data: LTE Cat 4 (150/50 Mbit/s), HSDPA+ (4G) 42.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording, TTY/TDD. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. GPS, A-GPS, Glonass, Cell ID, Wi-Fi positioning. Navigation: Turn-by-turn navigation, Voice navigation, Points of interest (POI). Other: NFC, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 04 Sep 2014. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Nokia Lumia 735: Design & Features. Review Update 03/11/2014 : Not much has changed for the Lumia 735 since we first reviewed it, but if you’re considering buying one it’s worth knowing about the forthcoming Lumia Denim software update. It was announced with great fanfare in September and Microsoft originally planned to release it this year, but it now looks like it will arrive some time in early 2015. It’s a shame it’s taken so long, but Lumia Denim should address some of our criticisms of the Lumia 735 and make it an even better phone.. The main new features concern the camera and the camera software, namely a new camera app. It adds one simple but much requested feature, HDR photo capture. Microsoft’s system works a bit differently, though, and is dubbed Rich Capture. When enabled, Rich Capture automatically takes HDR photos and captures multiple versions of the scene, using different levels of exposure for each shot and then merging them. The clever bit comes afterwards as you can select the ideal image from these multiple exposures using a simple slider. If it works as well as it looks like it does, it should make the camera experience on the Lumia 735 even better.. Rich Capture becomes even smarter when flash is enabled in dark conditions. In this situation Rich Capture captures multiple shots with and without flash, which you can then merge and adjust using a slider to get the perfect low light exposure. The new camera app will also bring an improved burst mode and should make the camera app slightly faster. All told, if it delivers on all these promises then it will be a serious upgrade to the Lumia 735.. There’s a decent chance the Nokia Lumia 735 is one of the last Nokia branded smartphones ever. Microsoft bought Nokia’s phone division earlier this year and is expected to drop the Nokia name in future. That’s a sobering thought for anyone who has bought Nokia phones over the years, but the good news is the Nokia Lumia 735 is a decent last hurrah.. The Lumia 735, which of course runs Windows Phone, is pitched as the ultimate selfie phone thanks to an ultra-wide, 5-megapixel front-facing camera. But it’s also a capable, 4.7-inch mid-range smartphone that includes 4G, NFC and even supports wireless charging with additional accessories. It has some wrinkles, but it’s free on contracts from £18 a month or £190 SIM-free, making it a decent value option if you fancy something different from the Android rivals like the Moto G 2 or Sony Xperia M2 .. Need help choosing a phone? Read our Mobile Phone Buyer’s Guide. The Lumia 735 sticks to the standard Lumia formula: it’s plastic and it’s colourful. We’ve seen the green and orange versions, which are bold, striking shades with a glossy sheen. There are white and black versions, too, but of the four we’d pick the green. The orange is a little too garish, while the black and white are just a tad dull.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. The smooth, curved shape is comfortable and the Lumia 735 has an unfussy quality that instantly endears itself. The only thing we’d change is the location of the power/standby button on the right edge — it’s about halfway down and a real pain if you use your phone in a cradle when driving.. Like most phones this price, the rear is removable and the battery is user replaceable. There’s a microSD card slot in there as well, so you can expand the 8GB built-in storage. This removable rear comes with one small complaint, though, as the case creaks a little when held tight or pressured at specific points. This gives it a slightly cheap feel, though the actual build quality is good — we dropped our Lumia 735 a couple of times with no ill effects, not even a scratch. SEE ALSO: Best Cheap Mobile Phones Round-up. Another benefit to the removable rear is that you can buy an optional Wireless Charging Shell and Nokia Wireless Charging Plate. Both are still listed as ‘coming soon’ but they’re neat options to have, even if they cost extra. Likewise, the Lumia 735 is unique among phones this price in including NFC.. In theory this allows for wireless payments, though in practice you’ll use it more for speeding up pairing with NFC equipped Bluetooth devices. That includes another upcoming accessory, the Microsoft Screen Sharing tool, which will let you beam your phone’s screen to a TV wirelessly using NFC to pair.. All of which means the Lumia 735 is a feature-packed phone for the price. They’re not all the kind of features you’ll use all the time, if at all if you don’t buy the accessories, but few phones this price can match it in this regard.. The Lumia 735 is powered by a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor, has 1GB RAM and includes the usual niceties such as Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and 802.11n Wi-Fi. There’s even an FM radio, a feature we don’t see often anymore. The cameras are 6.7-megapixels at the rear and 5-megapixels on the front, which means the rear one is unusually high and the front one is unusually low. We’ll get onto those in detail a bit later. SEE ALSO: Best Android Phones. First, though, the Lumia 735’s screen. It’s a 4.7-inch, AMOLED screen with a 1,280 x 720 resolution and it’s much like most AMOLED screens you’ll have seen, particularly among cheaper phones. Blacks are completely black, but colours — while rich — are overstated.. This combination means photos and videos look rich, deep and full of contrast, but also unrealistic. Skins tones have a ruddy, tanned complexion that’s out of character, something we noticed most when viewing photos taken on the phone than in online videos and films. We also found the screen tends to ‘crush’ the dark parts of videos so that, in one example, someone wearing a dark shirt seemed to merge into the dark background.. SEE ALSO: Best Mobile Phones. The other issue is that the Lumia 735’s screen doesn’t look as sharp as its 1,280 x 720 resolution suggests. Despite squeezing in 316 pixels per inch (ppi), only slightly less than the 326ppi of the new iPhone 6, it has a slightly grainy, pixellated quality. This is down to the way the sub-pixels are arranged (referred to as PenTile), which means the screen falls short of Moto G and Moto G 2 whose 720p LCD screen look sharper.. SEE ALSO: Best Windows Phone Round-up. These issues make the screen sound worse than it really is, though. Yes, colours are too much sometimes, but some people will like the punchy, contrasty look — it certainly works well with Windows Phone’s standard dark and colourful interface. Moreover, the most recent Lumia firmware update lets you tweak the colour settings, so you can tone down the colours somewhat. On balance, it’s a better screen than on the Sony Xperia M2 (960 x 540, 229ppi), it’s just not as good as the Moto G 2’s sharper, LCD display.. It also works well when outdoors. Again, it’s not quite as bright as the Moto G 2’s LCD screen, but it handles bright sunlight well and remains useable and the auto brightness system does a good job picking the right setting for the conditions..

In order to compete at the lower end of the market, Microsoft has given the Lumia 735 a super powerful 5MP selfie camera. Unfortunately, the rest of this Lumia seems to have been a little overlooked.. The Nokia Lumia 735 is a phone unashamedly targeting selfie fans, the latest 'love it or hate it' craze. Nokia is by no means the only manufacturer to have noticed this trend, the HTC Desire Eye shows just how big this market has become.. Pitching up free in the UK from £13pm (about US$21, AU$24) on 24 month contracts or available on PAYG from £160 (about US$259, AU$294) and £180 (about US$291, AU$331) SIM-free, the Lumia 735 certainly doesn't break the bank.. It also means that it fights against the likes of the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact , HTC Desire 610 and Samsung's Galaxy S4 Mini , as well as the go to budget handset, the Moto G 4G .. This is certainly one of the fiercest ends of the market, so what has Nokia packed in to give the Lumia 735 the edge?. The most obvious feature has to be the forward facing camera, measuring in at 5MP, more than twice the size of nigh on all front facing sensors. Coupled with a 4G connection to share those images, and it seems Nokia knows its market.. The Nokia Lumia 735 faces strong competition in the budget end of the smartphone market. On paper the Lumia 735 certainly seems rather impressive. Nokia has fitted a quad-core Snapdragon 400 SoC (system on chip) clocked at 1.2GHz backed up by 1GB RAM and an Adreno 305 GPU.. There is also 8GB of storage, backed up by 15GB of Microsoft's One Drive cloud storage and up to 128GB via a microSD card. All of this is accessed via the 4.7-inch HD screen, with the 720 x 1280 resolution giving a density of 312ppi.. Bright colours are a staple of the Nokia Lumia range. As with every Lumia handset, the Nokia Lumia 735 comes in a range of colours. My review handset is a rather bright green, with an equally bright orange available, as well white or black. Unsurprisingly, this brightly coloured handset is made out of plastic rather than metal, but it doesn't detract from the feel of Lumia 735 at all.. It does seem to pick up dirt easily though, 20 minutes in my bag on a walk left dark smudges that needed to be wiped off with a damp cloth. That meant removing the back plate, which is a little difficult, although I didn't ever feel like I was in danger of snapping it.. The curved 134.7 x 68.5 x 8.9mm frame reminds me of a much slimmer iPod Mini and sits very comfortably in the hand. The volume rocker and power/lock key on the right are the only buttons to hit and it is easy enough to do so.. The Nokia Lumia 735 is comfortable to hold in the hand, with only a few buttons to hit. In terms of ports the Lumia 735 has both the standard 3.5mm headphone port and microUSB port, situated in the middle of the top and bottom respectively.. The nanoSIM and microSD slots are both located behind the back plate, accessed by removing the 2220mAh battery.. There is a headphone port at one end, and the microUSB port at the other. I'm a big fan of the smaller screen as I have yet to buy into the phablet phenomenon, and it certainly fits the bill for the younger teen market that the Lumia 735 is going to be aimed at..

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. The latest Windows Phone powered handset comes from Microsoft's mobile division. The Nokia Lumia 735 is pitched at the selfie niche, but don't be blinded by the buzzword, this is a mid-range handset that. has a lot of power and potential.. Before I start, let me address. how to identify the team that has designed and built this handset. The phone is branded Nokia on the hardware, the model is the Nokia Lumia 735, the name string in the device is Lumia 735,. and ultimately it's been released by Microsoft.. 'Lumia 735' for the handset and 'Nokia' for the design and manufacturing team.. Just be aware that the back-story to the handset is still. convoluted, but when it reaches the stores, the consumers aren't going to want forensic details in the organisation of the parent company. All they'll want to know is if the Lumia 735 is a good handset.. The short answer is, yes it is.. One of the reasons I felt. comfortable with the Lumia 735 the second it came out of the box is the design. Built around Nokia's Fabula design language, the 735. is reminiscent of the Nokia Lumia 800 (the first Windows Phone from. the then partnership), the Meego powered Nokia N9, and the Symbian powered N8.. shallow bevel across the back plate, curved sides on the left and right of the handset, a flat top and bottom, and a hint of curve on the. Corning Gorilla Glass, is like welcoming. Sentiment aside, it sites nicely in the hand, and the shape has a long association with Nokia. That consistency of brand is going to be vital to Microsoft's. transitioning the Finnish devices and services section into Redmond..

It was more powerful than its 620 cousin , but not so much so that you'd consider it over the 820 unless you just had to have the first budget Lumia with LTE. If you're going to pay a lot more, why not get a lot more? Flash forward to 2014, and the Lumia 735 follow-up (along with the dual-SIM 730) appears to have more of a reason for being -- namely, catering to a selfie-loving public. With a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, more powerful internals and a €219 ($279) price, the 735 promises great self-portraits without decimating your bank account. But is it necessarily your best choice for those "I was there" photos? And more importantly, is it worth buying over both other Windows Phones and the other devices in its price class? You're about to find out.. Gallery: Nokia Lumia 735 review | 20 Photos. Hardware Display and sound Software Camera. One glance at the 735 and it's immediately clear that this is a textbook Nokia (or rather, Microsoft Mobile ) design. Its minimalist, rounded plastic shell looks like a Lumia 920 or 1020 , just without the bulk; the newer Lumia is only slightly narrower and taller to accommodate its 4.7-inch screen, but it's noticeably thinner and lighter, at 0.35 inch thick and 4.7 ounces. It's one of the most comfortable phones I've held in a while, and about my only gripe is that the sharp-angled corners occasionally dig into my palm. I'm also a sucker for the matte mint-green finish on my test unit, since it's at once eye-catching and resistant to dust and smudges. Don't worry if this or the glossy orange is too garish for your liking, by the way -- there are black and white models if you're a little more conservative.. Not that the ergonomics have improved across the board, whether you're comparing it to the 720, 920 or other previous Windows Phones. You'll still find the volume and power buttons in easy-to-reach places on the right side, a headphone jack on the top and a micro-USB port on the bottom. However, you won't see a dedicated camera key like you saw on the 720 as well as the more recent 830 and 930. Let that sink in for a minute -- the Lumia 735, a smartphone devoted to spur-of-the-moment selfies, doesn't have a quick way to take those selfies. It's an odd regression on a device that's otherwise a clear step forward, and it takes some of the fun out of a signature feature.. You may forgive that gaffe with the controls knowing the improvements to expandability. You can now pry off the entire rear shell, which lets you not only add microSD storage (already possible on the 720), but also swap covers and replace the 2,220mAh battery pack. If you regularly find yourself on weekend trips where wall outlets aren't an option, or you just can't stand USB battery packs, this could prove to be a lifesaver. The 720's Qi-based wireless charging has carried over, too, so you can plunk the 735 down on a compatible charging plate at the end of a long day rather than fiddle with cables. Just be ready to buy a microSD card if you're a shutterbug or otherwise tend to chew through free space. There's only 8GB of built-in storage, so you're going to run out of room very, very quickly if you aren't ruthless about deleting files.. Beyond this, the back holds both a speaker and a 6.7-megapixel camera with flash and a wide-angle lens; on the front, you'll see an earpiece, a mic and the phone's centerpiece 5-megapixel selfie camera. You won't find capacitive navigation keys, however. As with the Lumia 630 and 635 , you'll have to get through the Windows Phone interface using on-screen buttons. I didn't have a problem with these controls taking up visual real estate, but it could be a concern if you don't like toggling software keys on and off just to maximize the usable screen area for your apps.. If the Lumia 720's display was a disappointment, the 735's is a joy. Instead of a slightly cramped 4.3-inch, 800 x 480 LCD, you're now looking at a 4.7-inch, 1,280 x 720 AMOLED screen. There's much more room to breathe here, and visuals that once looked blocky are now crisp. The switch to AMOLED virtually guarantees deep blacks with full image quality at almost every viewing angle. Colors still pop without any obvious signs of oversaturation, and the output is wonderfully bright -- so bright that I had to turn the brightness down to "low" when I wasn't testing the battery. Suffice to say that you'll have little trouble using this Lumia in bright sunlight.. That doesn't mean it's flawless, of course. There are sharper screens if you're willing to go to higher-end hardware (the 750p Apple iPhone 6 and 1080p HTC One M7 come to mind), and it's notable that the second-generation Moto G sports a 5-inch, 720p LCD at a lower price. Moreover, you don't get the Lumia line's hallmark Glance feature, which shows the time and basic notifications while your phone's asleep. I found myself missing that convenience more than a few times during my trial run; I don't want to wake my phone up just to know how late I'm going to be. The 735 does have both a high-sensitivity and a double-tap-to-wake option, mind you, so it's still a good pick if you either like to wear gloves or don't want to reach for the power key every single time.. Sound on this Lumia isn't nearly as impressive. The rear-firing speaker is loud, but there's virtually no bass; you'll definitely be plugging in headphones to enjoy your tunes as they were meant to be heard. And while the grille is positioned at an angle that keeps it exposed on a desk (such as during a speakerphone call), it's a little too easy to muffle the sound while holding the phone in your hand. Given how closely the 735 resembles the 920 and 1020, I'm surprised Microsoft's mobile team didn't keep the speaker in an unobstructed position on the bottom.. Windows Phone 8.1 is no longer all that fresh, but it's still an important factor in whether or not you'll like this device. If the Lumia 720's software felt undercooked, the 735's comes across as well-done. There's a notification area to catch those important alerts, and Cortana's voice command engine will do your bidding; the Word Flow keyboard gives you swipe-based typing, and you have more control over the look of your home screen (including folders and wallpaper). There are still gaps in the OS, such as Microsoft's unorganized settings and Cortana's inability to handle timers. Even with the hiccups, you can pick the Lumia 735 without feeling that you're sacrificing basic features from Android or iOS just to get some of Windows Phone's key advantages, like Live Tiles and deep tie-ins with social networks.. It's also appealing for what you don't get: bloatware. Aside from the curious inclusions of Gameloft's GameHub and the Domino's Pizza app -- no, really -- my unlocked test unit was limited to the expected batch of Lumia apps (such as Beamer screen sharing), MSN apps (like Sports) and Here navigation tools. The best part? You don't have to keep many of these titles. Even if you wind up with a carrier-locked 735, Windows Phone will let you uninstall nonessential apps to either free up storage or remove clutter.. The platform still has an app deficit, though, and it remains an Achilles' heel. Don't get me wrong: Most of your needs are easily covered. You'll find Instagram, Swarm, Vine, WhatsApp and other staples of the modern smartphone experience. However, there are still a few holes. If you lean heavily on Google's ecosystem, Windows Phone still isn't for you. You'll find alternative apps like IM+ (for Hangouts messaging) and MetroTube (for YouTube), but the platform remains best when you're taking advantage of Microsoft's own wide array of software, like Skype and Xbox Video. The more pressing issue is simply the lack of "last mile" apps that cover specialized services and utilities, such as your local bank or transit authority; you may have to make do with websites or unofficial tools. The Windows Phone Store's selection is healthy, but Microsoft needs to focus more on the quality of its catalog, not just the quantity .. Photography is ostensibly why you're here -- if it weren't for the promises of high-quality selfies on a budget, there wouldn't be much to capture your imagination and lure you away from other smartphones. Thankfully, the Lumia 735 lives up to that billing... so long as your expectations match the price, anyway. The 5-megapixel front-facing camera is sharper than what you'll normally find in this class, and the combination of a wide-angle lens and a relatively bright f/2.4 aperture (both carried over from the 720) produces shots that are well-lit and let you fit an absurd amount of content into the frame. There was plenty of room for three people if I held the phone at arm's length, and solo self-portraits can easily include tourist attractions or other scenic backdrops.. With that in mind, Microsoft definitely isn't setting a new high watermark in photography. The Lumia's front cam has a slightly bluish tone, and shots in moderately dim settings are prone to both noise and occasional blurring. The dynamic range and shot-to-shot performance are also lacking. It's not uncommon to see blown-out skies in daytime images, and you frequently have to wait a couple of seconds as the 735 processes a photo; you won't be taking rapid-fire snapshots any time soon. I'm also of a mixed opinion about Lumia Selfie, Microsoft's app for -- what else? -- front-facing pictures. Its Auto Selfie mode is great for using the rear camera to capture photos, and there are plenty of filters and face-specific adjustments, but you have little control over the photo before you tap the shutter. If there's a sickly hue from a nearby street lamp, for instance, you'll have to fix it later. These limitations are fine for the price, but I'd prefer phones like the HTC One M8 (with a brighter f/2.0 lens) or iPhone 6 (with burst selfies and smarter image processing) if money wasn't a factor.. Gallery: Nokia Lumia 735 camera samples | 41 Photos. Performance and battery life The competition Wrap-up. And the back camera? You're still dealing with the 720's 6.7-megapixel sensor and a wide-angle f/1.9 lens, so the story hasn't changed much versus a year ago. It's fine for the price range, but the quality varies wildly depending on the situation. While images are often vivid and sharp in good lighting, there are occasional moments when the results are lifeless or flat-out inaccurate; like many Lumias, it periodically wrecks the color balance for no apparent reason. As with the front shooter, the main cam's dynamic range is limited and tends to hide detail in both highlights and shadows. It's capable enough in low-light situations, but don't let that sweet-sounding aperture fool you -- you'll still have to keep a steady hand for night shots.. Microsoft partly makes up for these shortcomings through its superb Nokia Camera app. The software doesn't just give you far-reaching control over elements like focus, sensitivity and white balance, but also presents all that control in a meaningful way. You'll see the effects of most changes in real time, and they're simple enough that you're encouraged to experiment. Case in point: Fully automatic shooting ruined a nighttime river scene, but the manual controls let me take a long-exposure, low-sensitivity image that was far more pleasing. You can also tie Nokia Camera into other apps through software add-ons ("lenses"), so you're only a quick hop away from the likes of Bing Vision searching or 6-second Vine clips.. Video recording on either of the 735's cameras (both of which can handle 1080p) mirrors the visual quality you get with stills, just with reduced input over the picture. You're mostly restricted to tuning white balance and focus when shooting with the main camera, and those few options go away with the front unit. Microsoft's real ace in the hole here is audio recording. As with many recent Lumias, there's a Rich Recording setup that prevents very loud noises from overwhelming the microphones, such as bass at a concert. The Lumia can be overzealous in muffling sounds with the default settings; occasionally, it sounds like you were recording from a closet. Nonetheless, that's still preferable to the unlistenable messes you frequently get from other phones.. Gauging the Lumia 735's speed is difficult. If all you're doing is measuring specs, it's no great shakes. Although the quad-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor and 1GB of RAM are miles above the dual-core chip and 512MB of RAM of the 720, they're strictly par for the course among low-end phones these days. In fact, the extra memory is this phone's only real performance advantage (albeit an important one) over the Lumia 630 and 635. Why would you pay Microsoft's asking price when something like the Moto G has similar innards for less?. Lumia 735 Lumia 720 Lumia Icon WPBench 245 179 471 SunSpider 1.0.2 (ms) 1,237 1,440 538 AnTuTu 12,060 7,348 25,750 SunSpider: Lower scores are better.. Because specs don't tell the full story; that's why. No, the 735 won't outrun high-end beasts like the Lumia Icon or One M8 for Windows , but it thrashes the Moto G in the SunSpider web browser test (1,237ms vs 1,534ms) -- proof that Microsoft can wring out additional performance through software. You'd be hard-pressed to tell that this wasn't a flagship just by steering through the basic Windows Phone interface. Scrolling is fast and fluid; transitions happen at a brisk pace; and many apps respond as quickly as you'd hope. If all you're doing is checking Facebook and playing music, this lower-end Lumia will serve you as well as something costing twice as much. It's certainly a better pick than the 630 and 635, whose low memory is going to curb your ability to run games and other intensive apps.. There's only so much Microsoft can do, however, and it's when you dive into demanding apps that it becomes clear you're not using a powerhouse. Besides slower web-browsing performance (it's roughly half as quick as the Icon in SunSpider), the 735 just isn't great for 3D gaming. A modest title like Wings on Fire plays smoothly, but you can expect stuttering in a visually rich arcade racer like Asphalt 8. No, it wouldn't be reasonable to demand blistering frame rates from a device so cheap, but you will have to dial your expectations back a notch.. You won't have to worry much about battery life. That 2,220mAh pack isn't huge in an era when some mid-size phones pack upwards of 3,000mAh, but it's also driving modest hardware. That's reflected in the healthy longevity I got during my stint. The Lumia 735 managed 9.5 hours in a battery-rundown test that involved looping an HD video at medium brightness with email, Facebook and Twitter running in the background; that's actually half an hour better than Microsoft's official estimate. It's more than enough to get through a day of moderate use that includes Instagram, Twitter, Swarm check-ins and instant messaging, although I would get nervous if someone invited me to enjoy a long night out.. No matter what, cellular performance comes up aces. The unlocked 735 I tried sadly didn't support North American LTE frequencies (only bands 3, 7 and 20), but it still managed very respectable averages of 21 Mbps for downloads and 8 Mbps for uploads on Rogers' dual-carrier HSPA+ network in Ottawa, Canada. It should play nicely on AT&T's network in the US, if you get the same model. Both ends of the conversation are loud and clear, while the noise-cancellation feature does a fine job of squelching background audio -- a recipient couldn't even tell that I had loud music playing in the background during one test. You should anticipate similarly stellar voice calls on the Lumia 730's two lines, but it's going to be slower given that it only supports single-carrier HSPA+ data.. The Lumia 735 is entering a crowded field of not-quite-entry-level smartphones, and your choices are going to vary dramatically depending on what platforms you're willing to use and where you live. You're likely to run into a few common alternatives, though, so let's dig in.. When you limit yourself to Windows Phone, the 735 is a fairly safe bet -- in part because it's tough to find brand-new handsets that directly compete in both price and size. A lot of what's available is a clear step down in both memory and screen quality, such as the Lumia 635 or Huawei's Ascend W2. If you have a set spending limit, you may want to consider the Lumia 1320. You'll give up the 735's camera prowess and quad-core processing, but you'll get both a gigantic 6-inch display and a long-lasting battery. If anything, the biggest threat to the 735 is the next step up, the Lumia 830. You'll lose some quality in selfies, but you'll also get a more powerful 10-megapixel rear camera, a hardware camera key, more storage and a slightly larger 5-inch screen. Even then, it's still tempting to pick the 735. It delivers nearly all of the 830's performance and display quality in a package that leaves lots of cash left over for accessories.. If you're not wedded to Microsoft's ecosystem, the rivalry becomes much fiercer... and frankly, the Lumia doesn't emerge unscathed. Not surprisingly, the elephant in the room is Motorola's second-generation Moto G. You're getting most of the experience for a smaller outlay (€199 or less in Europe, $180 in the US), and you'll get both a higher-resolution rear camera and a larger screen, to boot. While the 735 does have LTE data, wireless charging and better selfies, you'd have to value those a good deal to justify the premium. HTC's Desire 616 offers a similar bargain, although it's not as easy to find. Samsung's comparably priced Galaxy Grand 2 is no real threat, but do look at Huawei's Ascend G6 -- while you lose screen sharpness, you're getting a good selfie cam and a higher-resolution rear shooter for less cash.. I won't lie: I came into this review worried that the Lumia 735 would lean too hard on the selfie angle at the expense of other features, much like the 720 did. The 735 (and by extension, the 730) is really a capable, stylish budget smartphone that just happens to take some nice self-portraits. Microsoft Mobile has ironed out many of the kinks from the 720 while simultaneously lowering the price. How can you not like that? To me, the 735 is the real successor to Nokia's cult favorite, the Lumia 620. It costs a bit more, but it still strikes a fine balance among attractive design, affordability and solid performance. The 630 and 635 are only worth considering if you simply must have a modern Lumia and can't justify spending more.. Having said this, there are a few big items on my upgrade wish list. The 735's cameras could stand to perform better, particularly in darker scenes; it really needs a camera key, or at least a lock screen shortcut; it'd be nice to get both a faster processor as well as more built-in storage. And yes, the app supply remains a concern.

I just bought(SEP-2017) a refurbished Lumia 735 and really like the phone. Great battery life, QI wireless charging, good 6MP camera, screen and etc. Even with MS effectively abandoning Win10 Mobile, it's still good as a daily communications device albeit a bit limited on the app front. Still use an Android phone as my daily, but fun to own a bit of Win10 Mobile history.. Although some apps have abandoned the system (shame on them and Microsoft), I still find this phone to be useful with its fluid and simple operation. As long as Here Maps, Here Drive, Lumia Camera, Viber still works (on Windows Phone 8.1), I'm not switching to another phone yet. The size of the 735 is ideal, it's light and pocketable. The camera still takes great pictures.. Got this phone January 2015, still going strong today. The battery life is great, responsive, camera is good, even if only 6 MP(the actual maximum). I'm especially happy with the call quality - had a Lenovo, HTC and Huawei over the time - had to return them all do to bad call quality, faulty sensors, etc. There are just 2 big problems with this phone:. aged hardware - just 1GB of RAM, but it's not too noticeable.

A full day of battery life with moderate use. WiFi performance and cellphone coverage is excellent. Camera is not as good as the 928 but otherwise couldn't be more satisfied.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Didn't have high hopes for this phone as I just .... Didn't have high hopes for this phone as I just needed a cheap replacement, but it's much nicer than expected. I would definitely order it again!.

First smart phone I've had and still learning new things.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Skeptical Android user becomes a pleasantly surprised Windows fan. I have a 6 year odl granddaughter. The phone has been in my possession for three weeks and has been dropped twice as many times. I don't even have a hard shell cover (you can buy one here on Amazon. The power button is in an awkward location. You have to get used to it. The first couple of days out of the box I accidentally turned the phone off while making a call. A little practice or soft case takes care of that problem. this is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. There is an app for almost everything. And more are coming every day. Can't find an app you were used to on your Android or iPhone? Google it. (And yes, you can use Google on this phone. I found an ingenious app that not only took care of the lack of a Starbucks app in the Windows Store, but also stores all of my bar and QRS codes in one place. The photo quality is good to excellent. If you factor in the price I would have to go with excellent. If you are into Selfies, you won't do better at twice the price. As far as sim card issues. I don't understand what the issue is. The sim card in my phone was originally installed in an Android phone that I returned because as some of you may have found out the hard way, Android limits your ability to shift apps to your SD card. Thus, your 128GB sd card is pretty useless when only 5 percent of your apps can be moved. Windows allows 95 percent of your apps to be moved. I removed the sim from my Android when I returned it. I transferred the sim card to that phone. It was not the correct size so we had to separate the sim card and put it in a sim card case. After a few days, I decided I really did want the Lumia (The Lancet was 50 bucks cheaper, I decided to spend the extra 50 bucks). I returned the Lancet, bought the Lumia. The sim needed a different case and it worked as soon as I turned the phone on. I do not, have not and will never use Bing to search for anything. I switched from Dogpile (anyone old enough to remember Dogpile?) to Google years ago. Inability to use Google on a Windows phone would have been a 100 percent deal breaker. I downloaded a tile program (cool tiles), created a Google tile and I have Google as my search engine. I can search by typing or by mic. Folks, if you are a die hard Android fan and are not willing to take some time to adjust you are not going to like this phone. My first smartphone was a T-Mobile G1, which I believe was the first HTC Desire. I have had nothing but Android phones since then. I think my 21-year-old kid was 13 when we bought our G1's. It took me about a week to learn my way around this new phone. After 3 weeks I am a pro. So last point, I have a Windows computer, a Lumia cell phone and a tablet and Laptop running windows 8.1 and 10 respectively. Whatever you do or store or have on one device can be on all, some or none as you see fit. I would strongly suggest you give this phone a try.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars I forgot how much I liked the Windows platform. Recently came back to Windows phone after using a Pixel that costs $650. What a joke! They have alot of work to do before I ever use one of their phone again. I forgot how much I liked the Windows platform. Syncs great with my email and most of my accounts. It has a feature that lets you import your contacts wirelessly which I couldn't get to work. Took out the sim card from the Pixel and hopefully that will work itself out. Everything else is working great so far. Ive had other Windows phones such as an HTC one which I really liked. Poor battery life caused me to maybe hope for better with a Pixel which constantly has ads popping up which causes the phone to malfunction sometimes. Windows phone is much more reliable and Im glad it still works well. I hope Verizon brings them back. HP is suppose to be in talks with them currently according to Windows Central I like that you can change out batteries too. Ive found out over the years sometimes the first battery doesnt always work so I have to a spare. Haven't bought one yet but it stays charged for close to two days if I don't play around on it after its charged. The one that came with the phone is great. Was this review helpful to you?. I am surprised by this phone. Reviewers are right the windows store doesn't have many "kids" games. 5.0 out of 5 stars HONEST REVIEW. I bought this same model new at Verizon Wireless in March of 2017 for around $160. Loved the phone but I had an accident and cracked the screen. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone For Me. I love it and will never go back to the tyranny of apple and iTunes. Although this phone is super awesome I wouldn't buy it from this seller again. 3.0 out of 5 stars great phone, bad seller. No connectivity on anything else, period. Can't text a pic, can't send an email, nothing works on this worthless phone. T' Wretched Reviewer With Malice Aforethought. 1.0 out of 5 stars Crap. I upgraded it to Windows 10 and it works great!. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Right now its the only player on Verizon. Under powered for this market but Some great things too. Removable battery, wireless charging, SD memory. 4.0 out of 5 stars Better Than a lot of other phones for $100s less. If I could give this phone minus stars I would. The only apps it allows you to download are from the Microsoft store and some of them don't work very well. 1.0 out of 5 stars Worst piece of junk I've bought in a long, long time!. Windows Phones are the bomb I cannot understand why everyone doesn't want a Windows phone.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone. What other items do customers buy after viewing this item?.

by Brett Howse on February 3, 2015 6:00 AM EST. 1 GB LPDDR2, 8 GB NAND. 1 GB LPDDR2, 16 GB NAND. 4.7” 1280x720 ClearBlack OLED. 134.7 x 68.5 x 8.9 (mm). 139.4 x 70.7 x 8.5 (mm). f/1.9 , 26 mm focal length,. 2200 mAh, 3.8 V, 7.04 Wh. BV-L4A 2200 mAh, 3.8 V, 7.04 Wh. 802.11 b/g/n (2.4 GHz) + BT 4.0,. Back in September, Microsoft launched what would be the last two Nokia branded Lumias. The Lumia 830 was announced as an affordable flagship, and we. The Lumia 730 and 735 were launched with a different feature set, a lower price, and a higher resolution front facing camera. Microsoft announced them as “built for Skype calls and selfies” with the inclusion of the five megapixel front facing camera. and put the package in a smaller, lighter body. It was launched with four colors, with the 730 being a dual SIM version. and the 735 is a single SIM with LTE capabilities.. Right after our Lumia 830 review, Microsoft asked if I would like to review the 735 as well. Although many of the internals are similar or identical to the 830 and 630, there is enough different that this is really a unique phone in the Lumia range. It lacks the PureView branded camera system, but still has a good camera. The OLED display is 720p, which is a step up from the lower cost 630, and the same resolution as the 830, but in a slightly smaller screen size. At 4.7”, this is the only Lumia available at this size.. The Lumia 830 tried to put a higher end package together. with the metal frame, 5” display, and a PureView 10 MP camera with OIS. into a less expensive price bracket. Although the SoC in the 830 is only a Snapdragon 400, it is overall a great phone which is hampered only by its price. The 735 steps the price down further and packages the phone in a more traditional Lumia style with a fully polycarbonate body.. Internally, it is very similar to the Lumia 830. The Snapdragon 400 MSM8926 provides the quad-core Cortex A7 at 1.2 GHz, as well as the LTE modem. Memory is identical at 1 GB of LPDDR2, which opens the entire range of Windows Store apps to this device. The OLED display also features ClearBlack, which is a polarizing filter to keep refractions and reflections from outside lighting to a minimum. Storage is less than the Lumia 830, with only 8 GB of internal NAND available. A micro SD card slot allows an additional 128 GB to be added, and Windows Phone’s Storage Sense app makes it easy to control where your data gets stored. The latest update to Windows Phone also allows future software updates to be staged to the SD card, making the 8 GB not as much of a detriment as on other platforms.. One rather large omission, which is available on the Lumia 830, is Glance screen support. Every Lumia should have Glance, as it is one of the best features. Because this one does not, it is a big knock against it, especially when moving from an older Lumia with Glance support.. Please log in or sign up to comment.. kspirit - Tuesday, February 03, 2015 - link. Brett, I applaud you for reviewing all the new Lumias here on AT. Thank you Also I maintain this is a more interesting phone than the 830, given the price points for both. Brett Howse - Tuesday, February 03, 2015 - link. Thank you for the kind words, and I won't flame you. iAPX - Tuesday, February 03, 2015 - link. I think that the Lumia line-up is a little weird, but there are many options and I would consider them when it will be time to replace my smartphone (basic usage, but a lot of music to store, for example on a micro-SD card, and tethering for my tablet). I think Nokia have done a great job to differenciate their products from the Android crowd, at least physically, and Microsoft is following with affordable Lumia smartphones. iAPX - Tuesday, February 03, 2015 - link. Addition: as a photographer, Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) is of no interest except for 135mm+ equivalent (35mm format) lenses. Not on wide-angle, not for capture the true life where people are moving, because you will have too long exposure time with clear and sharp environment and blurry people! My 2 cents!. Laxaa - Wednesday, February 04, 2015 - link. It is useful for low-light shots and video, though. But I do agree with the rest of your sentiment. bretpowell - Wednesday, February 11, 2015 - link. The Lumia series has not been very popular to consumer, even if you look on a consumer base review (like http://www.phonestop7.tk/ for example...) they're nowhere to be found. But with the latest Windows 8 incorporated...hope things would change. Sushisamurai - Tuesday, February 03, 2015 - link. does "Battery Saver mode" really equate to "stop background sync" on the other platforms? i'd still assume windows would have a separate option in settings. Zizy - Tuesday, February 03, 2015 - link. Well, it stops non-essential tasks and background stuff. But it doesn't change performance by slowing down CPU or something like that. I don't think you gain a lot by using battery saver during these rundown tests. It shows high gains mostly in light use. mantikos - Tuesday, February 03, 2015 - link. It also stops checking for e-mail and wifi networks to conserve battery. You can of course manually do both. Alexvrb - Thursday, February 05, 2015 - link. Battery Saver is great for what it was designed for. Obviously it isn't going to help much if you're actively using your phone, but it really stretches the "in-pocket" time if you forgot or were otherwise unable to charge it.

The last time we saw a Nokia Lumia on Verizon was last year with the Lumia Icon. That device has been discontinued and Verizon’s Lumia Windows Phone selection has been seriously lacking. Now Verizon has finally gotten a new Lumia Windows Phone in their line up and it’s the Lumia 735. Of course, this device is kind of old too. The original version was unvieled in Berlin in September of 2014. 9 months later, the Verizon version of the Lumia 735 is now available. The Lumia 735 is kind of a mid-range phone by last year’s standards, but in 2015 it still has a few nice things going for it. Last year, of course its claim to fame was the high resolution front facing camera for better quality self portrait photos, but these days plenty of other phones have added that kind of feature. Read on for our full review of the new Microsoft Lumia 735 for Verizon.. The Lumia 735 has a 1.2 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7, a Qualcomm Adreno 305 GPU, and 1GB of system RAM along with 16 GB of internal storage. If that’s not enough, you can add up to 128 GB of storage by installing a MicroSD card under the battery cover and what’s excellent about Windows Phone 8.1 is that you can now move or install apps to the SD card.. The phone’s size is 134.7 x 68.5 x 8.9mm and the weight is 133g. The screen is a 4.7” Monoblock touch Technology ClearBlack, OLED display with a 1280 x 720 pixel resolution which translates to a print quality 312 pixels per inch. It’s got an ambient light sensor, accelerometer, proximity sensor, magnetometer, and SensorCore for excersize tracking. The rear-facing camera is only 6.7 megapixels, but the sensor shape is made in such a way that the aspect ratio you choose will crop the sensor differently so you’ll never get that full resolution. The best you can do is a 4:3 aspect ratio which will give you 6.1 megapixels. The front facing camera is 5 megapixels, and you’ll get the full resolution from that if you switch to a 4:3 aspect ratio. It’s all powered by a 2220 mAh Microsoft BV-T5A removable battery. Of course it’s got all the usual stuff as well, GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth and even NFC. For Verizon’s network connectivity, you’ve got LTE Band 13/4 (700/1700 MHz), CDMA/1xEVDO Rev. Best of all, the Lumia 735 comes with Qi wireless charging capabilities AND a removable battery cover. That means you can swap to a different color without an awkward case and still have that sweet wireless charging capability.. The Lumia 735 feels great in the hand. When I first held it, it reminded me of the original Nokia Lumia 800 Windows Phone. The sides are round, the back is smooth, and the camera is flush with its body.. The 720 x 1280 pixel screen has plenty of pixel density for sharp print-quality viewing. It looks really great, and it’s got better viewing angles than the Lumia 640’s screen. Of course the bottom buttons are part of the screen now instead of separate capacitive buttons as well.. In direct sunlight, of course the screen visibility can suffer significantly, but the Lumia 735 seems to do just a little better on the outdoor contrast than the Lumia 640’s screen.. On the right side there’s a power button and an up/down volume control. The buttons are easy to find with your fingers and they’ve got great tactile feedback, and they feel a lot sturdier than the same buttons on the Lumia 640. A dedicated camera button is missing, which is extremely unfortunate. To launch the camera, you’ll have to pin its tile to your start screen, or add the camera quick action to the Action Center.. On the top is the 3.5mm headset jack and it’s nicely flush with the battery cover which wraps around the front of the phone.. The front-facing camera on the Lumia 735 is its big selling point, or was back in 2014. This new Verizon version has Microsoft’s new branding instead of the old Nokia branding.. Of course there’s more Verizon branding on the back as well. The little speaker grill seems out of place though.. The sides of the screen are very subtly rounded on the edges. It’s a nice touch that makes the screen feel like it’s integrated with the round edges of the plastic covering.. The Micro-USB port on the bottom is very cleanly placed within the covering. Usually you see a metal border around the port, but this is totally flush with the body and it looks very high-quality.. On the back is the 6.7 megapixel camera and LED flash. It is flush with the battery cover, which looks great, but that makes it a little too easy to get fingerprints on the lens (which might cause weird light streaks on your photos). Yes, this is a Carl Zeiss lens and there is a single LED flash.. Thankfully, the Qi wireless charging battery cover is removable as is the battery. The battery is a BV-T5A model with 2220mAh capacity. That’s different from the BV-T5C battery used in the Lumia 640. Like the Lumia 640’s battery, spares are difficult to find, but there are some on eBay for $28 with a $48 shipping fee. That is much more expensive than the spare batteries you can get for the Lumia 5XX series (BL-5J) which you can get for $5 with free shipping.. Also found under the battery cover is the Nano-SIM card slot and a MicroSD card slot for expanding the storage. The 16Gb of included storage will probably be enough for many people, but it’s great to have the option of adding additional room for apps, music, videos, and photos.. The Nokia Lumia 735 ships with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 (OS build 8.10.15148.160) as well as Nokia’s “Denim” firmware. You can read more about the operating system in our Windows Phone 8.1 review as well as our Windows Phone 8.0 review , but there are a few new things in the version of the operating system on the Lumia 735 that we weren’t able to test in our original review. For example, there’s a new feature where you can double tap a blank area of the bottom toolbar between the back, start, and search keys and that will put the phone into sleep mode. Combine that with the double-tap to wake feature and you don’t really need the power button anymore. The settings are also organized differentlly and there’s a search field for quickly finding the setting you want to change. Bluetooth keyboards and Miracast display wireless connectivity are also now supported. Verizon also includes a number of special apps for some of the Verizon services. In fact, the first-boot sequence was modified to enable a number of new dialog windows asking if you want to sign up for some of those Verizon services.. The “My Verizon Mobile” is a great way to manage your Verizon bill, plan, usage, etc. It does not have a live tile and the user interface seems very badly designed but it will get the job done. It does not have a live tile to show you your usage stats either, so that’s disappointing.. Verizon doesn’t have visual voicemail that integrates with the phone app on Windows Phone, so they’ve added an extra Verizon-made Voice Mail app. It has a few extra features too. You have a lot more sorting options, you can upgrade to premium voice mail, you can flag voice mails for follow up, you can save voice mails, and they are also transcribed as text! When you save a voicemail it is stored in the “Music/Saved Voice Mail” folder as an AMR file and a text file.. The Verizon Navigator GPS navigation software is also bundled with the phone. The included free version lets you search for points of interests, view maps and get directions. If you want, you can upgrade the software to enable spoken turn-by-turn directions, live traffic, 3D buildings, etc. The upgrade costs $4.99/month or $0.99 for one day. However, you can use the free HERE Drive+ (which is also included) for offline turn-by-turn GPS navigation.. We’ll talk about the front-facing camera on the Lumia 735 first, since last year, that was its big selling point. The 5 megapixel resolution was twice as much as most other phones on the market at the time. However, as you’ll see in the samples below, more pixels doesn’t always mean better image quality. There’s still lots of noise and lack of detail probably due to such a small sensor size.. The 6.7 megapixel camera on the back of the Lumia 735 is okay. There’s a sharpening filter applied to the images, occasional color issues, poor LED flash performance, but that’s par for the course when it comes to smartphones. Plus the Lumia 735 only supports the Lumia Camera 4.9, not version 5. That means you won’t get the cool “Rich Capture” features for adjusting lighting effects and exposure after you take the photo. It does support live images though.. Comparison between the Lumia 735 and Lumia 735 rear cameras.. In the above 100% crop sample we can see how the Lumia 735’s 6.7 megapixel image compares to the Lumia 640’s 8 megapixel image. We see a lot of software based sharpening, but the amount of detail (or lack of detail) is similar. Also note a color difference between the two cameras.. Take a look at the full resolution camera samples below. The first two show the difference in resolution between the default 16:9 aspect ratio, and the 4:3 apsect ratio. The 16:9 is 5.3 megapixels, while the 4:3 is 6.1 megapixels! Both are cropping out parts of the sensor, but the 4:3 gets more data in the frame. The next 3 samples are well-lit outdoor shots and the Lumia 735 does pretty well with those. Next is a low light flash test and the Lumia 735 actually lights this scene pretty evenly. The single LED here is much better than the dual LED flash on the LG G4. The next two are a couple of selfies from the front facing camera. Yes, the resolution is a nice 5 megapixels, but there’s lots of noise. The Lumia 735 scored 236.56 in WPBench, compared to 245.07 on the Lumia 640, 218.14 on the Lumia 630, 169.25 on the Lumia 521, 234.73 on Lumia 928 or 232.11 for the Lumia 925. The Lumia 735 is not quite as quick as the new mid-tier Lumia 640, but it holds its own against older 900 series flagship Lumia devices.. In WP Bench’s battery life test under constant CPU stress, the Lumia 735 lasted for about 4 hours 27 minutes. That’s about 30 minutes longer than the Lumia 640 and 1.5 hours more than the Lumia 630. As mentioned earlier, the BV-T5A model battery with 2220mAh capacity is difficult and expensive to find replacements for. It’s not the same as the battery found in other Lumia phones either, so that makes replacements even more difficult.. The Lumia 735 supports Verizon’s Advanced Calling features, which include HD Voice, Video Calling and simultaneous voice/data access. Unfortunately, the HD Voice and Video Calling features only work with other Verizon Wireless customers who also have the HD Voice feature enabled on a compatible phone. That’s probably going to limit the usefulness of the feature. Otherwise, you’ll just get the normal call quality that we’re all used to.. For LTE network performance, Verizon is doing pretty good. While sitting close to a tower and running the Speedtest.net app, I’ve been getting download speeds of about 18-23 Mbps and upload speeds between 5-7 Mbps. Of course that depends on the time of day, but it’s not quite as good as the 50 Mbps download and 13 Mbps upload speeds I sometimes get with T-Mobile USA.. The Lumia 735 is $192 off contract from Verizon , or $29.99 with a 2 year contract, or $8/month on a Verizon Edge plan. Personally, I think $192 is a bit expensive for a 9 month old phone. If the price was a lot closer to the $129 that other carriers are asking for the Lumia 640, then it would be much more competitive. Unless your biggest selling point is the use of Verizon’s network, in which case the Lumia 735 is your best option right now.. Verizon’s last Lumia smartphone was the Lumia Icon which was released in February of 2014, almost a year and a half ago. The Lumia 735 is not exactly a worthy replacement, but it’s better than nothing. Honestly, the Lumia Icon could still best many of the other phones in Verizon’s lineup today, especially with the Denim update it recieved in February of 2015. Even if you’ve got an older Lumia 928 on Verizon, the Lumia 735 would mostly be a downgrade for you. Unfortunately, Microsoft has been concentrating on releasing budget friendly smartphones these days, so we’re not seeing anything spectacular here. The Lumia 735 is probably most comparable to the Lumia 640 which is also being released on T-Mobile, AT&T, and Cricket this month. Both phones are in similar price ranges. The 640 has a better rear camera with the excellent rich capture feature and the awesome glance mode, but the Lumia 735 has a better front facing camera, better screen, better battery life, better build quality, and the awesome Qi wireless charging support. Honestly, if the Lumia 735 was priced at $150 instead of $190 with no contract, it would be the better deal. Still, if you have to use Verizon and you’re looking for a Windows Phone, the Lumia 735 is a great device..
