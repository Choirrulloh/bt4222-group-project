CNET también está disponible en español.. HTC 10 brings the noise, but it's not a Galaxy killer. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The HTC 10 has an elegantly chiseled design, brilliant audio quality and a highly customizable user interface.. The Bad The handset's non-removeable battery doesn't last as long as its competitors and its camera doesn't always render exposure correctly.. The Bottom Line Get the HTC 10 if you want a phone that delivers great audio. For all your other needs, look elsewhere.. Software: More fun at your fingertips. Sound and audio: Here comes the Boom. If there's one thing the HTC 10 can do, it's deliver great sound. Its dual speakers, coupled with some fancy software technology, means your music and movies are going to sound fantastic. It also looks pretty damn good too -- a hard feat to pull off in a world filled with black slabs.. But at $699 unlocked, £569 in the UK and AU$1,099 in Australia, it fails to offer the same hardware performance and value as its Android rivals. For instance, its performance is comparable to the. Google Nexus 6P even though the 6P is cheaper. Its battery doesn't last as long as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 , and there are times when its camera exposure misses the mark.. While those competing handsets could stand to have better audio quality like the 10, HTC's flagship phone ultimately doesn't have all the other things that elevate a good phone into a great phone.. Up close with the streamlined metal HTC 10 (pictures). The 10 has an aluminum construction with angular edges that adds to the polished, industrial aesthetic HTC is famous for. Its unibody design does mean you can't take out the battery, but the phone feels solid and looks handsome.. With its high-end look, the 10 is a stunner when it comes to design.. HTC got rid of the dual front-facing audio speakers seen in previous years. Now the phone has one speaker grille on the top bezel and a home button (which doubles as a fingerprint reader) on the bottom bezel. The second speaker is still there though, except now it lives on the bottom edge.. As for the fingerprint reader, it provides extra user security and it launches Google's digital assistance service, Google Now, after you longpress it. Though it's not a deal breaker, this Now shortcut can get irritating. There were a bunch of times when I accidentally launched Now just from resting my finger on this home button and it was no fun having to quit it constantly throughout the day.. The 10 runs Google's Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system with HTC's Sense user interface skinned on top. HTC has gone for a deeper integration with Google, meaning the only web browser you see is Chrome, the only music player you have is Play Music and the only gallery you have is Google Photos.. I love getting rid of bloatware as much as the next person, but I wish HTC kept the native gallery app. I'm super wary about cloud security, and even though you can turn Google syncing off, I just don't want my personal photos linked in any way to any cloud or Google service.. The HTC BlinkFeed (left) and a playful theme option with "stickers" as app icons (right).. There are some welcomed software goodies though. HTC's signature BlinkFeed gives you a feed of your news and social networks. And Themes lets you customize parts of your interface like the layout, wallpaper and app design. The cool thing about some of these themes is that their home screens aren't restricted by any grid lines, so you can place apps and widgets anywhere.. Apps also don't have to look like labelled, uniform icons. Instead, HTC calls them "stickers" and they come in different size and shapes. If you play around with Themes long enough, your home screen can end up looking like a page out of a children's storybook, with little objects that launch apps only you are privy to knowing.. A marquee feature of HTC flagships is an emphasis on audio quality, which the company brands as BoomSound. Music through the dual audio speakers definitely sounded louder and clearer than the usual thin and sharp audio I get from other devices.. But what really impressed me was listening to music through the included earbuds. To get the most out of the buds, I configured my "audio profile," which tested the frequency range that I could hear in each ear, and optimized audio output accordingly.. Music through the earbuds sounded amazing -- bass was deep without becoming too overwhelming and I could discern each layer of instrumentation. (If you're curious, I was listening to Gallant's "Ology" album. Do yourself a favor and go listen to it .) Undoutedbly, the audio quality is one of the strongest features of this phone.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News. Homeland Security's tall order: A hacker-free election. 'Annihilation' director wove memory into a dream-like movie.

HTC 10 review: Iconic, impressive, imperfect. HTC returns in style, with one of the best Android phones of the year so far.. After a disappointing couple of release cycles, HTC's 2016 flagship is a confident return to form, and a reason for high-end buyers to start paying attention to the company once again. This impressive all-rounder gets a lot of important things right — performance, build quality and, for the most part, the camera. And although it's trumped by the Galaxy S7 in some key metrics, the HTC 10 is arguably the closest competitor Samsung has right now.. Fast performance and clean, uncluttered UI. Camera focusing can be finicky, particularly in macro. Battery life inconsistent, sometimes wildly so. It's easy to write off HTC. With its declining market share and shrinking revenue, it's been some time since it was a major force in the mobile world. Today, the Taiwanese firm is outspent by Samsung and Apple, and increasingly outmaneuvered by leaner upstarts. It's a small fish in a very big pond.. Nevertheless, HTC's strong history in design has left many of us with fond memories of the company's storied back catalog. Phones like the spectacularly ahead-of-its-time HTC One M7 , and the beautiful and unique One S , and even the landmark Nexus One stand out as some of the best handsets of their time.. HTC needs a hit now more than ever.. However it's been a good couple of years since the last real trailblazer from HTC, and competing in the the cut-throat phone market of 2016 demands more than just nostalgia. With diminished resources and brand value, HTC needs a hit now more than ever before.. HTC 10 is what's hoped will fuel the recovery: A new, simpler brand backed up by a marketing message promising nothing less than perfection across the board. Sure, some of the key ingredients will be familiar to HTC alumni — BoomSound audio, metal construction and an "Ultrapixel" camera. But can a modern interpretation of these tentpole HTC features make a big enough splash — especially when it's got to go up against the almighty Galaxy S7 ?. 12MP Ultrapixel 2, ƒ/1.8 lens, OIS, laser AF. 5MP Ultraselfie front camera, ƒ/1.8 lens, OIS. We're publishing this review after a week with an unlocked European HTC 10 (model 2PS6200 / M10h) on the EE and Vodafone networks in the UK. We've been using the phone in Manchester and London, UK, in areas with generally good 4G LTE coverage. Our device has been running software version 1.21.401.4, and it's been paired with a Moto 360 (2015) smartwatch during most of our testing. Security patch levels aren't shown in the menus, however the AIDA64 app shows that it's got the March 1, 2016, patch.. Our review unit is the "carbon gray" color option with 32GB of storage, and we've used it with a 64GB microSD card for photo storage and Google Play Music download cache.. We've also been using an unlocked North American model for two weeks now, in New York City and Pensacola, Fla. We've not seen any noticeable differences between them, and the vast majority of this review is based on our European device.. The HTC 10 represents a return to the manufacturer's design roots. An aluminum unibody with familiar angles and curves, accented by a deep chamfer circling the back, make up a modern interpretation of a classic smartphone design. Aside from the prominent branding on the back, there's a ton of HTC design DNA here. Everything from the contrast between the lustrous machined trim and the softer matte back, to the trademark antenna bands, is pure HTC.. A modern interpretation of a classic smartphone design — An M7 on steroids.. Veterans of the brand might recognize it as a refined, souped-up version of the company's past few flagships. Essentially, it has the look of an M7 on steroids.. It's also HTC's most ergonomic and easy-to-hold phone in recent years, and all without sacrificing the premium design elements we've come to expect. The curved back is a comfortable fit for the hand, while that enormous chamfer — combined with the flat, angled side walls — ensures a steady grip.. The HTC 10 isn't the thinnest or lightest handset you'll come across. (Nor, with an enormous metal enclosure, would you expect it to be.) That's not a bad thing — it's easy to overstate the value of both properties. What's more important is a phone which feels sturdy and well-built, and that's exactly what's conveyed by the HTC 10's somewhat chunky unibody and clean, uncluttered glass front. Its overall vibe is more industrial than the sleek, glassy Samsung Galaxy S7 , but there's nothing at all wrong with that.. The rear chamfer shimmers as the HTC 10 rotates through light.. The main decorative feature — that oversized chamfer — may be a little polarizing. But there's no denying it gives the HTC 10 a necessary visual differentiator in an incredibly crowded field. And when combined with the darker antenna band in the carbon gray model we've been using, it works. On the gold and silver models, it's more pronounced — the chamfer is far more reflective, and makes the phone appear to shimmer as it tilts through different angles of light.. The HTC 10's rear camera — a 12-megapixel "Ultrapixel 2" shooter which we'll discuss in greater detail later — protrudes ever so slightly through the metal back, but not enough to cause any real issues in day-to-day use. (In fact, the slight camera bump means the phone doesn't wobble quite so much when placed on a flat surface.). Up top, that extravagant metal design is broken up by two engineering necessities — a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a plastic section for antenna reception. It's easy to ignore on the dark gray model, but stands out a little more in the gold and silver versions.. Meanwhile, you're looking at a fairly standard port and button arrangement — a textured power key and smooth volume rocker on the right edge, below the nano-SIM slot, and a microSD tray over on the left. Down below you'll find a USB Type-C cable (supporting USB 3.1 Gen1, which means faster data transfer speeds) alongside one of the HTC 10's two loudspeakers.. HTC once again brings some serious audio credentials to the table.. Unlike its past few flagships, HTC's latest does away with the front-facing stereo speakers that had become a staple of the "M" series. Instead there's a new "BoomSound Hi-Fi" setup consisting of one front-facing tweeter (in the earpiece) and a bottom-facing woofer, each with its own amp, and Dolby lending its expertise on the processing end. Although it functions differently from earlier BoomSound implementations, the results are still impressive — powerful bass, and more volume than you're likely to ever need without any noticeable loss in clarity.. Because you've got one speaker facing towards you and another pointing downwards, the HTC 10's output is prone to more distortion when holding the phone in-hand, mainly due to the woofer being so close to your palm or index finger. The effect is less noticeable if the phone is lying flat — as it may well be if you're playing music.. Of course the phone's built-in speakers aren't your only option for music playback. HTC has some serious power behind its headphone port too, with a dedicated amp capable of delivering an output level of 1V, according to the company's own numbers. And using wired studio headphones, the difference is clear: HTC's pushing more power than Android rivals like the Galaxy S7.. The company is also keen to highlight the HTC 10's status as a high-definition audio certified device, with support for 24-bit audio and HD audio earphones bundled in the box in some countries. (Not including the United States, unfortunately.) It' s a neat addition sure to appeal to audiophiles, if not those of us mainly playing compressed music from streaming services.. Nevertheless, phone audio is important — it's where many of us listen to music the most. So it's great to see HTC continuing to pay close attention to audio hardware, even though the days of front-facing speakers seem to have passed.. The display is equally important, of course. It's a 5.2-inch SuperLCD5 panel at Quad HD resolution, just as we'd expect from a modern Android flagship. Generally speaking it's a good-looking screen, with vivid colors and ample brightness without appearing excessively over-saturated. (There's an optional sRGB mode in Display Settings for colorspace purists.) Off-angle visibility is decent too, with only slight color shifting noticeable on our unit at wider angles.. Sadly, wonky auto-brightness and less than spectacular sunlight visibility conspire to make the HTC 10 a little challenging to use in brighter conditions. Like a handful of other phones, including most of Samsung's high-profile models, the HTC 10 has a display overdrive mode that over-brightens the screen when very bright ambient light is detected. The problem is this doesn't kick in anywhere near as consistently as we'd like to see. Furthermore, the 10's screen appears more reflective than Samsung's latest round of SuperAMOLEDs, so it's hobbled from the outset.. It's possible some of these nagging issues with auto-brightness will be addressed in a software update. Even so, the HTC 10 is clearly a step behind the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 6s in outdoor visibility.. But there's more going on around the front than just the screen. The HTC 10 has a unique new button arrangement built around the capacitive fingerprint scanner, which doubles as your home key. On either side you've got capacitive back and recent apps keys which illuminate, Samsung-style, for a couple of seconds when pressed.. In fact the similarity to Samsung's way of doing things makes the HTC button setup particularly vexing if you're coming from a Galaxy phone, as the button order is reversed. It's not a huge thing, but it's definitely a thing.. HTC nails it once again, with an excellent fingerprint security setup.. The fingerprint scanner itself is among the best we've used on an Android phone. Setup is quick and painless, as is using your fingerprint to instantly power on and unlock the phone. Apple's Touch ID is faster, sure. But we're talking tiny fractions of a second here. We've also noticed fewer fingerprint-related failures in day-to-day use on the HTC 10, compared to Samsung's sensor on the GS7.. Powering this whole assembly is a collection of parts fit for any high-end smartphone. Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 820 chip lurks within, paired with a hefty 4GB of RAM and 32 or 64GB of storage, with microSD expandability. Unlike many rivals, HTC supports Android 6.0's Adoptable Storage (also known as Flex Storage), letting you directly tag your SD storage onto your internal memory and use it for just about anything. (It's possible to find apps that can't save to it, but that's the exception, not the rule.). there's a 3,000mAh fixed internal battery, along with support for Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0. Unsurprisingly, the HTC 10 also appears to be backwards compatible with QuickCharge 2 in the handful of older chargers we tried.. As a whole then, the HTC 10 is an impressive hardware package — the latest 2016 internals brought together in a beautiful unibody enclosure, with a high-end audio setup, a decent screen and convenient fingerprint security.. The HTC One M8 in 2014 brought us the Dot View case, the neat dot-matrix flip cover that showed you the time, missed calls, weather and other info through a low-res grid of dots on the front cover.. With the HTC 10, we're introduced to the successor to Dot View — a higher-res interpretation of the same idea, dubbed Ice View.. Read our introduction to the HTC 10's Ice View case. Of all the numerous flavors of Android, HTC has generally presented some of the most coherent UI concepts atop Google's OS. HTC Sense has been unique yet attractive, with meaningful changes, and not completely removed from Google's vision of Android.. Then in late 2015, the HTC One A9 pared things back dramatically with a new Sense version — 7.0 G — that included many stock Android elements and design cues in place of HTC's.. Now on the HTC 10, we've got Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and an all-new version of HTC Sense. The Sense software on HTC 10 doesn't actually have a version number — at least you won't find one in the Settings app. Instead it's advertised as simply "Android with HTC Sense." And that's a reflection of what Sense has become in 2016 — a collection of differentiated apps, UI tweaks, under-the-hood optimizations and standout features that complement the Android OS without completely redesigning it.. A 50-50 mix of Google and HTC apps, but a very Googley visual style in the most pared-back HTC Sense yet.. Through a close partnership with Google, HTC has reduced the number of duplicative apps bundled on its new flagship, using its own apps in cases where it makes sense, and in others ditching these offerings in favor of Google's. So you've got HTC's Sense Home with BlinkFeed, but the Google Calendar app. Sense Dialer, Google Photos — and so on. The overall app mix is about 50 percent Google and 50 percent HTC, but because HTC's software has adopted a Material Design look and feel, Sense manages to avoid looking like two systems haphazardly tacked together.. When it comes to the overall look and feel, the HTC 10 is way closer to vanilla Android than what HTC One M7 and M8 owners might remember as Sense on their phones. Key elements like the notification tray, quick settings and the Settings app match the "Nexus" software experience almost identically, while the color scheme of the default Sense theme also mirrors that of vanilla Android.. As vanilla as Sense now is, HTC's comprehensive theming engine remains in place, giving HTC 10 owners endless possibilities for customization of colors, wallpapers, fonts and sound effects. And new in the latest version of Sense, Freestyle mode is a wacky home screen layout that lets you replace traditional icons with stickers, and make your home screens an interactive scene where tapping stickers opens your favorite apps. Being increasingly old and boring, we played around in Freestyle mode for just a few minutes before retreating to the familiar territory of our grid of icons.. BlinkFeed, HTC's social and news reader, once again gives you a scrolling panel for Twitter updates (but oddly not the preloaded Facebook or Instagram —. they need a separate social plugin ) and news stories. And the service continues in a similar vein to what we first saw on the One A9, with more prominence given to the News Republic brand. BlinkFeed news stories display in the News Republic app, and customization is handled through that system as well. This means HTC doesn't need to update this component itself, but with notification nags and account sign-in pop-ups, it's a definite step back in terms of user experience. (Either way, BlinkFeed is easy to turn off if it's not your cup of tea.). HTC has ton of software audio enhancements — with one odd omission.. HTC's focus on audio extends into its software, too. When playing stuff through the built-in speakers, you'll be able to choose between music mode and theater mode, which tweaks the EQ levels for different types of content. And when you're connected to headphones you'll have four options to choose from depending on the type of headset. Only problem is everything except "Other," the generic option for all headphones, sounded weirdly muffled to our ears, regardless of which headphones we were using.. Annoyingly, these "BoomSound" software enhancements conjure up a persistent notification whenever any audio or video is playing — including silent videos in Instagram and Twitter. What's more, the notification pops up even if all BoomSound enhancements are turned off, which is mildly irritating.. HTC's sound setup also includes the ability to make audio profiles that tune the phone's output to individual listeners or different audio hardware. This is done either by listening to a series of tones and answering questions, or by telling the software a few things about you (for example how old you are, what kind of music you listen to.) For us, the result was slightly louder output, with a bit more oomph given to the low end.. For all the HTC 10's audio tweaks and preset modes, the one thing that's missing is a dedicated software equalizer for setting your own levels. It's easy enough to download one from Google Play, but for a phone with such a musical focus, it's an odd omission.. Another software oddity is the "Boost+" app preloaded on the HTC 10, an application which does a handful of useful things — like letting you lock away sensitive apps behind fingerprint security, or tweak games' performance for better battery life. It can also help clear up "junk" files like old downloads and cached stuff.. Boost+ does some useful things, but randomly clearing apps out of memory isn't one of them.. HTC's Motion Launch has grown a couple of new useful features, the most helpful of which is a double-swipe down on the screen when asleep to jump straight into the camera app. HTC Connect — the feature which lets you swipe up with three fingers to stream content to other devices — now supports AirPlay. In fact, the feature has already rolled out to older HTC phones through an app update. The setup wizard on our European HTC 10 gave us the option to install a selection of stuff from a list of "popular" apps. Ostensibly that's a useful feature that saves you time poking around the Play Store later. But some of the apps on offer here toed dangerously close to bloatware territory. (Money had obviously changed hands to get stuff on this list.). The unlocked HTC 10 we reviewed works with EE's Wi-Fi calling in the UK, however we were unable to get Vodafone's Wi-Fi calling to work on the device. As Vodafone isn't planning on ranging the HTC 10, it's unclear whether there'll be any official solution here. We also used Wi-Fi calling on T-Mobile in the U.S. When it does work, Wi-Fi calling dumps an unsightly persistent notification in your notification tray, which is less than ideal.. But strangely, Boost+ also, by default, sits in the background clearing apps out of memory periodically. It's not clear why this is necessary — Android's memory management is pretty good, and in the Linux world free RAM is mostly considered wasted RAM. The only real upside: We didn't notice any performance difference either way with "Auto Boost" either on or off. So at least it didn't appear to be doing any harm.. Not that the Sense of 2016 needs any help being smooth and responsive. As you might expect, HTC's software absolutely flies, and we experienced no instances of stuttering, animation lag or performance bottlenecks anywhere during our time with the HTC 10. Part of that's surely due to the sheer hardware muscle of current high-end phones, but the manufacturer also claims it's fine-tuned things under the hood for maximum performance. Given its track record in eking smooth, responsive performance out of less than stellar hardware (like the One A9), we have no reason to doubt it. But it's arguable that we're reaching the point of diminishing returns in smartphone smoothness and performance. Though for sure it's blazing fast, I can't say the HTC 10 felt noticeably quicker than either the Nexus 6P or Samsung Galaxy S7.. Overall, HTC has employed a lighter touch than ever in its software customizations, and the result is an experience we think will please Android purists and HTC fans alike. It's fast, it looks good, and the feature set, though not extravagant, brings enough unique stuff to the table to add real value.. A handful of related software bits:. If there's one area in which recent HTC phones have thoroughly disappointed, it's photography. Through a combination of hardware misadventure and lack of competent software tuning, the M7, M8 and M9 were pretty sub-par cameras compared to their competition.. HTC finally — finally — has a good camera.. It starts with an impressive collection of specs. The HTC 10's rear shooter is a 12-megapixel "Ultrapixel 2" setup, with the Ultrapixel brand referring to larger pixels on the sensor. HTC's camera setup has 1.55-micron pixels (like the Nexus 6P), letting each tiny dot take in more light than traditional smartphone cameras, which tend to measure around the 1.1-micron mark. HTC's paired that beefy sensor with an f/1.8 lens, optical image stabilization (OIS) dual-tone flash and a laser autofocus unit. On paper, then, you couldn't ask for much more out of a high-end smartphone camera.. Update May 4, 2016: Right around the time of the phone's release HTC put out a firmware update that ( in addition to other things ) tweaked the camera a good bit. You can see new samples and read our updated impressions here .. Around the front, Ultrapixel morphs into Ultraselfie , with a new optically-stabilized 5-megapixel front facer — the first selfie camera we're aware of with OIS. It's got smaller pixels than the M9's Ultrapixel front-facer (1.34 microns versus 2.0), but the addition of OIS and a higher overall resolution tilts the balance in favor of the HTC 10.. HTC's Ultrapixel 2 camera is unfazed by most lighting conditions, be they bright, backlit pics or night scenes lit by streetlights.. Technology is one thing, but it doesn't guarantee you'll be able to take great pictures. Fortunately, HTC has mostly nailed it with its new flagship's camera. It's quick to launch, lightning-fast to capture and reasonably speedy to focus. Crucially, it exhibits none of the metering and exposure weirdness we've seen from earlier HTC cameras. With its large pixels and optical stabilization, the HTC 10 is unfazed by darker conditions, and we've been able to get some great-looking night shots out of the phone — with one or two caveats.. The HTC 10 is pretty trigger-happy with its ISO levels in darker shots. Compared to major rival Samsung's Galaxy S7, the HTC 10 tends to crank up sensitivity levels to ensure a steady shot in low light, as opposed to leaning on its OIS and opening the shutter for a little longer. This results in some visible chroma noise in darker shots — although HTC's camera routinely captured more realistic colors in night shots than the GS7, which gives things a yellowish tint.. Photos from the HTC 10 generally have true-to-life, realistic colors. HTC's photos appear a little less punchy than Samsung and LG's more saturated output, but look great in their own right. At the same time, it's clear HTC isn't sharpening its images as aggressively as its chief Android rivals, leading to pics that appear a little softer when viewed up close. On the flip side, we sometimes noticed areas of fine detail being mushed out by HTC's noise canceling and HDR algorithms, an issue that's less apparent with the competition.. Dependable in most conditions — but HTC's software occasionally stumbles in macro mode.. But the main point of contention has to do with macro shots, where HTC's software can get a bit confused. Despite the use of laser-assisted autofocus, the HTC 10 takes noticeably longer to focus on close subjects than competitors, sometimes failing to focus entirely. And on multiple occasions the phone told us the laser was being blocked when trying to take macro shots. All of these small frustrations combine to make a camera that's just a little bit wonky when it comes to snapping food pictures, flowers or other shots where the camera is close to its subject. Hopefully some of this can be ironed out through future software updates.. Tapping the screen to focus doesn't set the exposure level, either. The phone instead uses the entire screen to figure that out, and that can be frustrating if you're trying to highlight something in the foreground, with light coming from behind the subject. While that'll keep you from blowing out what's behind, it also means what's in front may be darker than you want.. Like most Android flagships, the HTC 10 can shoot video at up to 4K resolution, with a time limit attached: in this case, 6 minutes per clip. There's no such limit when shooting at 1080p, which is the default for the video camera.. OIS, 4K resolution plus high-definition audio makes for an impressive video camera.. Overall, the HTC 10 shoots great-looking video with similar characteristics to its still camera — realistic colors without oversaturation, and a little focus hunting in scenes with lots of movement. Optical stabilization kicks in to make camera movement smooth and shake-free, even when walking with the device in one hand. The phone's impressive mics, combined with optional high-res audio capabilities, are able to capture a wide range of sounds in louder conditions like concerts or noisy bars.. As for the front camera, HTC's new stabilized selfie shooter mostly lives up to the hype. In all but extremely dark conditions, it's able to pick out your mug and successfully focus in on it. And when it is darker, the phone can overdrive the screen's brightness briefly to act as a makeshift flash. If we were to nitpick, we'd point out that the front camera's focus seemed a little soft in places. On the whole, however, we have no major complaints.. HTC has also overhauled its camera app, finally including single-tap shortcut keys for flash and HDR. And there's now an Auto HDR mode — on by default —which does a great job of automatically detecting shots with bright and dark areas. Just about everything else is tucked away slide-out menu over on the left — features like Panorama, Pro mode, which includes RAW capture, and Zoe shot, a combination of burst shots and a few seconds of video. HTC's camera app also boasts slow-motion video, as well as a built-in Hyperlapse mode for stabilized time-lapse video, both at 720p. And there's a regular old "settings" menu tucked away in there too, which is a bit of a rat's nest. Fortunately there's nothing crucial buried back there.. A big change (and part of this new Google-HTC relationship) is that Google Photos is used as the gallery app. It's a fully functional gallery app, but it can get a bit busy and confusing, especially if you're importing photos from other sources into Google Photos. If you just have to use HTC's gallery app, it's available in Google Play. Or you're certainly free to use any other gallery app.. One thing we'd like to see is a faster quick shortcut for launching the camera app when the display is off. It's possible to double-swipe down on the screen to open the camera, but this isn't as quick as the double-tap shortcuts we've seen on other phones.. Not a perfect smartphone camera, but still a really great one.. This isn't a perfect smartphone camera. There are minor complaints here and there. There are numerous instances where the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 6s will take subjectively better-looking photos than the HTC 10, mainly because of Samsung and Apple's lead in image processing. But equally — particularly at night — there are times when the HTC 10 will come away the better-looking shot.. HTC has come a long way in the past year, and we're way more confident in the HTC 10's photo capabilities than any of the company's previous phones. This is a camera worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as the Galaxy S7 — even if there are still some software issues to be worked out.. The HTC 10 comes with a fixed 3,000mAh battery, with Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0 support, and a unique charger from HTC. In addition to Qualcomm's latest rapid-charging tech, the plug incorporates power management circuitry from HTC in order to regulate current in the brick itself, as well as integrated surge protection. (Perhaps in an effort to avoid damage to the phone or the charger if a dodgy USB-A to C cable is used.). Rapid charging is a hugely important feature for a high-end smartphone, allowing a dead handset to quickly return to life with a reasonable amount of charge. HTC claims the 10 can go from zero to 50 percent in 30 minutes, and our real-world experiences back this up.. As for battery life itself, it's been something of a mixed bag. Longevity hasn't been poor per se, more inconsistent — and sometimes wildly so. Indoors on Wifi, the phone sips power. Outdoors on LTE, it can guzzle juice alarmingly quickly. Some days, even on LTE, the phone would easily last us to the end of the day. But on other occasions we'd hit the 50 percent mark in just a couple of hours.. Ignore the hype: There's no way you're getting two days out of the HTC 10.. Following a week of use, battery life seems to have stabilized somewhat, and we'll update this review with any long-term findings.. That said, on a typical day we were getting between 12 and 14 hours out of the HTC 10 with mixed, moderate-to-heavy use on Wifi and LTE, both indoors and outdoors. That consists of browsing in Chrome, chatting on WhatsApp, Slack and Hangouts and streaming music through Google Play Music, along with capturing a few dozen photos. Nothing to sniff at there, but it's a far cry from the vaunted "two-day" battery life proclaimed in HTC's marketing materials.. Bottom line: Expect battery life that's passable — decent, even — but nothing spectacular. Certainly nothing near the two days HTC claims in its marketing material (which undoubtedly makes heavy use of the software-enabled power-saving features.) Even so, the bonus of rapid charging with the bundled plug makes it easier than ever to translate a brief time on charge to a meaningful boost in battery level.. Should you buy the HTC 10? Yes. Where to buy the HTC 10. The HTC 10 is unquestionably HTC's best phone ever. It's also a great Android phone in its own right, with an attractive metal unibody, top-notch audio credentials, fast and uncluttered software, speedy fingerprint security and a camera capable of taking great photos.. Even in the areas where it doesn't shine so brightly — the distinctly one-day battery life, and the display that's unspectacular in daylight — there's nothing it's straight-up bad at. Is it a "perfect 10?" Probably not. The HTC 10 doesn't exist in a vacuum — HTC will be asking for flagship money in a world where the Galaxy S7 exists.. The biggest issue here is that the HTC 10 doesn't exist in a vacuum. HTC will be selling the 10 for flagship smartphone money in a world where the Samsung Galaxy S7 exists. It'll be dropping a great phone into a veritable ocean of great phones.. Samsung has set the bar really high this year with two truly excellent handsets. This is what you get when a corporate giant pours its enormous resources into making the best smartphone it can. By comparison, HTC doesn't have the vertically-integrated tech, or the scale, or the financial might of its major rival. It's not even close to being a fair fight.. Nevertheless, this is the comparison HTC invites with its claims to perfection.. And this leads into what in my view is the HTC 10's Achilles' heel: The areas where HTC actually truly beats Samsung are so very few and far between. It can drive headphones with more power. You'll get more accurate looking night shots, sometimes. The software is somewhat closer to stock Android, if that's your thing. Even build quality is mostly a question of personal taste — do you prefer glass or metal? By contrast, Samsung can point to its its superlative displays, wireless charging, water resistance, VR integration and, in the case of the GS7 edge, market-leading battery life.. A worthy challenger, if not quite the very, very best.. The HTC 10 is nevertheless a phone that deserves your consideration, and potentially your money too. And given that LG's G5 seems to have fallen flat , it's probably the closest competitor Samsung has right now. That the HTC of 2016 can create a phone like this is impressive, and a reason for its continued relevance.. Depending on how things play out in the months ahead — and how well HTC's marketing is received — this phone could emerge as the de facto alternative to the Galaxy S7. Ultimately, that's what the HTC 10 is: a worthy challenger, if not quite the very, very best there is.. The HTC 10 will be available direct from HTC, and from independent retailers in the United States, Canada and the UK. In the U.S., it's available on T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint , in Canada it'll only be offered on Bell , and in the UK it's been picked up by EE and Three, as well Carphone Warehouse as the usual unlocked sellers..

The HTC 10 has stood the test of time remarkably well. After months of use I haven’t had any serious issues with the phone.. Unlike competing phones, like the Huawei P9 , the HTC 10 remains lightning fast. Games open in a matter of seconds and run chug- and stutter-free and I’m yet to have a serious software crash.. Related: HTC U11: This HTC’s next flagship. The phone has also survived more than average wear and tear. As well as several standard accidental drops onto TrustedReviews’ carpeted floor, the phone also survived a hazardous impact with a tree after an accidental trip while running. It remained crack and chip free.. Battery life has slightly deteriorated, but not as much as I’d expected. The HTC 10 still easily lasts a full day off one charge and I regularly manage to eek out two days with light use.. The camera is still a slight annoyance, but only because I’ve experienced the majestic awesomeness of the Galaxy S7 – which still has the best phone camera sensor on the market.. The HTC 10’s camera isn’t bad, but the use of Ultrapixel tech, which instructs the camera to capture bigger pixels and more light, works a little too well. Photos taken in even moderately bright lighting conditions are regularly washed out and have unwanted flare effects. Careful use can get around the issue, however, and I’m still more than happy to snap memento shots of meetups with friends.. However, the phone’s biggest selling point remains its advanced audio qualities. HTC’s been leading the mobile audio market for quite some time and the 10 cements its position as the best phone maker for music fans.. Putting aside the phone’s Boomsound speakers that, while above average, are only useful to cretins that insist on using their phone to listen to music outloud, the HTC 10’s standalone headphone amp is its best feature.. The HTC 10 uses a dedicated DAC as well as headphone amp. HTC claims the 10’s amp is twice as powerful as competing phones, and after a few months with the phone I believe it. The HTC 10 consistently delivers superior audio quality to competing phones, including the Galaxy S7, LG G5 (without its add on DAC), OnePlus 3 and Huawei P9 on a variety of genres.. Everything from heavy metal, punk, prog and jazz sounds fuller and better balanced on the HTC 10 and it’s a key reason the 10 remains my handset of choice, even though it falls behind its archrival, the Galaxy S7, in other areas..

After the frankly awful HTC One M9, the Taiwanese brand went back to the drawing board and, well, it worked. The HTC 10 more than matches up to the iPhone 6S in looks, and it doesn’t fall behind the Samsung Galaxy S7 when it comes to specs.. With its sloping curves, aluminium body and clean front, the HTC 10 is one of the best looking phones on the market, but with the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy Note 7 coming soon is it still worth buying?. Video: Watch our HTC 10 video review. While the HTC 10 takes the brand’s flagship smartphone in a new design direction, it’s still very familiar. The front is stripped from the One A9, and the back is a tweaked and tuned version of the rear casing from the One M9 .. It’s far from original and looking at it face-on you’d be forgiven for confusing it with an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S7, but for me it’s the perfect mix of style and substance.. First off, this phone is clearly made from metal – and proud of it. The back is cool to the touch, with an elegant curve that helps it sit comfortably in your hand. This curve flows into some heavily chamfered edges that add a bit of much-needed flair.. It’s a divisive design choice, though. I really like them as they give your fingers somewhere to sit, but the some of the TrustedReviews team were less impressed, claiming they’re far too shiny.. Related: HTC 10 vs Samsung Galaxy S7. The camera sensor sits bang in the centre, and while it doesn’t have what I’d consider a ‘hump’, it does jut out ever so slightly. Alongside it is an LED flash and a space for the laser autofocus system.. Like any metal phone, the sleek design is broken up by two bands of antenna lines that run around the top and bottom. These don’t stand out anywhere near as much as they do on the iPhone and they feel like part of the design, rather than something that has to be there.. Along the side you’ve got the usual combination of a volume rocker and sleep/wake button, the latter of which is bevelled and easily identifiable even when the phone is in your pocket.. Most other phones have switched to a single tray that houses both the Nano SIM tray and a microSD card, but the HTC 10 still has one tray on each side. I’d like to see this combined to makes things sleeker, but it makes little difference in reality.. Flip the phone over and the HTC 10 is one of the cleanest devices around. HTC has even removed its brand logo – a minimal change that makes a big difference.. Compared to last year’s One M9 flagship, there are a couple of major differences here.. There’s now a capacitive home key sitting below the display that isn’t so much of a button but a touchpad. Like pretty much every worthwhile Android phone this year it features a fingerprint scanner inside, but coming from the Galaxy S7 it feels strange not to get get that satisfying ‘click’ when I press down.. HTC has also switched to capacitive Back and Recent Apps keys, as opposed to on-screen versions, and these sit either side of the home button. It’s all down to personal preference whether you prefer physical or virtual buttons, but it does free up that extra bit of screen real estate.. The phone comes in black, silver and gold. Whereas LG took plenty of risks with its funky modular design of the G5, HTC has played it relatively safe here. In fact I’d say the HTC 10 is my favourite phone of the year so far when it comes to the overall look and feel.. It almost matches the Galaxy S7 for size, though it’s marginally taller and noticeably weightier. It feels reassuringly expensive and solid, which is something I just can’t say about the LG G5.. It’s the precision, though, that wins it for HTC. Everything is symmetrical, with the headphone jack, camera sensor and USB-C port on the bottom, all in line with each other. I would have preferred to see that headphone port on the bottom, but that’s just a minor quibble.. Considering its history, it’s no surprise that HTC has designed a stunning looking phone. It hasn’t taken risks and opted for something more ‘out there’, but it still has charm and is an absolute pleasure to use.. HTC has updated just about every part of the One M9 for its successor, and the display is no exception.. It’s grown slightly to 5.2-inches, but the bigger upgrade is the resolution. It’s much more pixel dense now, thanks to the 2560 x 1440 quad-HD resolution, and it covers 99.9% of the sRGB colour gamut. It’s a mightily impressive panel, though as it’s LCD – 5th-generation LCD, to be precise – it does lack a little of the vibrancy of Samsung’s Super AMOLED screen. It’s not far off, and it’s hard to notice unless you have both phones sat next to each other.. Related: HTC 10 vs iPhone 6S. It’s a lovely display to look at. Colours are punchy and bright, without being oversaturated, and they’re accurate too. The wide colour gamut is great for watching video as it was originally intended and accurately editing snaps, making this a strong media machine.. There is a slight pinkish tinge to the display when it’s tilted to the side and this dampens viewing angles, but it’s not a deal-breaker. Viewing angles are still great and reflections are kept to a minimum, but colours are skewed ever so slightly when you’re not looking directly at it. I had a similar issue with the Galaxy S7 Edge , so it’s certainly not a problem exclusive to HTC’s displays.. The HTC 10 is missing a feature both the LG G5 and Galaxy S7 tout, which is an Always-On mode. This clever method of displaying your most recent notifications when the display is seemingly off is far from essential, but it’s a useful extra that I’ve grown to like after using those two phones. LG managed it with an LCD screen, so I’m not sure why HTC hasn’t tried anything similar.. What it does offer over its rivals is improved brightness. In regular use, the maximum brightness on the HTC 10 is much brighter than that of the LG G5 and Galaxy S7, though it doesn’t feature the trick used by those two where it can boost brightness even more in direct sunlight. Still, the HTC 10 is perfectly usable outdoors.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Not quite 10 out of 10. HTC has put all the right bits in here, but I felt the same way with the One M9. However, the brand seems to have addressed the foibles and it's easy to get genuinely excited by the HTC 10.. There's a new top dog in the HTC range: meet the HTC 11 HTC 10 price and release date Launched May 2016 Initially cost £570 / $699, now £470 / $400 Key features iPhone-like speed under the finger Massively improved sound recording quality New multi-directional speakers Excellent hi-res headphones in the box Strong build quality. Update: The HTC 10 Android Nougat update has landed on the phone, plus there's been a price drop thanks to the arrival of the HTC U11 .. The HTC 10 was a phone that's the product of years of learning, which is why the company created a phone that's big on design, strong on camera and brings a very user-friendly interface into the mix.. HTC's flagship phone from 2014, the One M8 , was one of the greatest phones ever made and the HTC 10 is the product of a lot of key learnings from that era.. And the good news is the HTC 10 impresses, offering the right improvements to the design, battery and UI - although you'll need to read on to see if you agree that the interface is improved in the right ways.. In terms of design, it's got an all-metal body, thankfully doesn't go down the same iPhone-a-like design as the One A9 from 2015, and doesn't just stuff in tech for the sake of having a higher spec.. 145.9 x 71.9 x 9 mm OS:. When it comes to price, the HTC 10 is now available for £470 / $400 / AU$1099, which is still a little on the expensive side for a phone that's been out for over a year.. It is, however, cheaper that its launch price of £500 / $599 / AU$1099, with the drop in price partly due to the arrival of its successor, the HTC U11 .. To put that into perspective against its 2016 rivals, the superior Samsung Galaxy S7 and modular LG G5 are cheaper.. The price may have failed to drop as steeply as expected, but it stills gives a strong showing more than 12 months after launch.. One of the most irksome features of the HTC One M9 was… well, there weren't really any features to talk about. The same BoomSound speakers were back, firing audio forwards into your face, and the camera was just a 20MP effort that took some okay pictures; not terrible, but nothing you'd tell your friends about down the local watering hole.. In fact, it was just the design that made it worth checking out at all, that combined with HTC's special sauce.. With the HTC 10, thankfully, there's a lot more to talk about, starting with the efforts made to improve how the phone feels to use. It's got a much lower latency compared to the earlier models, which means the response under the finger is a lot more impressive.. In fact, the constant chat in our briefing about the phone was about 'tuning', that HTC had gone further than any other brand in making the HTC 10 a phone that will impress the second you glide a finger across the screen.. The screen is also upgraded from the previous model, using Super LCD 5 and boosting the pixel count to QHD resolution, offering 564 pixels per inch, to push up the sharpness significantly.. The camera is dropped in terms of the megapixel count, down to 12MP with a 4:3 resolution (sound at all similar to any other top-end phones on the market?).. HTC tells me this is something actually requested by photographers, and given the brand has put such a big effort into making the camera as good as it could be, it's believable that HTC would listen to such advice.. The 10 has also been given a DxO Mark of 88, which HTC was talking up at launch, but this isn't something the consumer should read too much into - it's more a reflection of potential rather than the photos you'll snap.. The camera, which supposedly has blink-and-you'll-miss-it autofocus thanks to the second-generation laser autofocus on offer, also comes with 4K video recording combined with 24-bit sound, so you'll get professional-grade videos when you're out at a gig and completely missing the chance to enjoy the artist you paid so much to see.. Talking of the audio, that's the other area HTC's been putting a big effort into. The two front-facing speakers, which looked so iconic on the front of the recent One range, are gone, with two speakers now firing out the high end and bass tones separately.. They also point in different directions using separate amplifiers working in concert to give amazing sound without headphones... or so HTC claims (spoiler alert: they don't).. The headphone element is important though, as HTC has taken the bold step of not only making the HTC 10 Hi-Res Audio Certified, but has also bundled in some high-end headphones with the handset, so everyone has access to the improved tones.. These aren't cheap to make, so it's good to see HTC taking a hit on its margins to give something back to its users. And a special word for the interface, which HTC is bragging quite heavily about – and it's anything but heavy. The brand has worked with Google to 'reboot Android' and make something cleaner, more easy to use and upgrade, ridding the phone of pointless duplicated apps in the process.. The aim is for the project to eventually find something that all brands will use, leading to an end of the skins that sit atop LG, Samsung and Sony phones despite them all using the same base software. Will that happen? Would it be a good thing for HTC? Who knows – but it's good that someone's trying.. You can unsubscribe at any time and we'll never share your details without your permission..

The HTC 10 may have a very generic and unexciting name, but it is definitely headed in the right direction for the usually sidelined cell tech company. Compared to previous HTC models, the 10 knocks it out of the park. While the 10 is an overall solid phone with powerful speakers and a sleek design, it does not really knock out the competition from Apple, LG, or Samsung just yet.. In the hand, the 10 feels solid and sleek. It has an all metal back and curved edges. The only downfall to the metal design is that the phone back and battery are not removable. On the front of the phone, there is a 5.2 inch display encased in gorilla glass and a finger print scanner/home button at the bottom. A unibody design makes it water resistant but not water proof.. This Android phone is running Android's latest Marshmallow operating system. The quad core Snapdragon 820 inside can run speeds of 2.2 GHz. Paired with Adreno 530 CPU and 4 GB of RAM, this phone can run smoothly at comfortable speeds. While it has a solid configuration, the speed is really nothing special compared to like models, but it will do what is required of it. 32 GB of storage with a microSD slot give users plenty of storage space.. For some, the lack of built in software is nice because they like the choice of choosing from different types of music and messaging apps. HTC, however, has decided to integrated more closely with Google and offers one music player, Chrome web browsing, and only one photo gallery. This reduces the drain on the phone's storage and operating system, however, it limits the choices the user will have in basic software.. The home page interface allows users who do not like the built in design choices to choose the "freestyle" option that lets them move design elements around the page to create a unique background. Still, each page will only hold 20 apps, so there is a lot of empty space around the thumbnails that can be irritating to some users.. The 5.2 inch Super LCD 5 display is the first 2K HTC phone to be released in the US. The text and picture is sharp with good saturation levels. A quick jump to the settings allows a user to switch the color options for a vivid display or one that is a little more conservative. Viewing angles are great except for the tendency of the screen to take on a reddish hue when it is viewed off center.. The audio quality is one of the HTC 10's strongest attributes, and is probably one of the only things that can set it apart from its closest competitors. The dual speakers themselves are forward facing and configured with the BoomSound system. This system is louder and clearer than most of the other phones on the market, and it contains options to switch the speakers from music and movie modes. The different modes, however, do not often provide very differing results. Although the speakers are less thin and tinny like other models, headphones are still a better option for the best listening experience.. When users put headphones in the HTC 10, the phone will prompt them to create a listening profile. Setting up a profile is easy, users simply walk through the prompts asking to listen to different tones in each ear to adjust to the best listening experience. Have several sets of headphones? There can be multiple profiles to accommodate a change in headsets and speakers. The audio profile allows users to create an overall brighter and each level of instrumentation becomes clear.. Besides containing great audio options, the phone also is the first Android to support Apple AirPlay right out of the box and connect and play music through the TV system. The connection is fairly stable, but there is not currently a way to stream video. Even though Android and Apple are two competing companies, it is nice to seem them play nice in order to bring a better product to the consumer.. Today's cell phones most often double as cameras to catch all of life's moments. That is why it is so important for phones to have easy to use cameras that produce a clear picture in variable conditions. The 10 produces clear pictures in good quality light, but it has a hard time in back lit conditions. It is very difficult to get the light settings to illuminate objects in the forefront when the lighting is coming from behind it. Even tapping on the object and adjusting the light selections does not remedy this problem.. Overexposure is also a common issue with the HTC 10's camera. This leaves some pictures too bright with bland colors. There is, however, a bar at the bottom of the camera that allows the user to adjust the brightness. Still, the camera likes to produce an overexposed image.. Focusing in light conditions is fairly simple. There is an auto focus feature that works well in bright conditions. Occasionally it acts up and it is difficult to focus on the correct objects. Darker conditions make it even more difficult to focus. While the camera is functional overall, it does not quite outstrip its competitors.. The battery in the 10 is not removable which means that battery life is a very important factor to consider in the 10's performance. While the 10 has much better life than the previous HTC models, it still does not quite stack up to comparable competition. The 10 clocks in at about 11 hours and 15 minutes on continuous video playback in airplane mode and about 10 hours during moderate use. The HTC's biggest competitor, Samsung Galaxy S7, lasted 16 hours during the airplane mode test.. Even though the battery life is fairly good, it's not always consistent. Sometimes the battery usage spikes dramatically for seemingly no reason at all.. While the battery life may not quite outstrip its competitors, the 10 does include a fast charging cable. HTC boasts that this cable can charge the phone 50 percent in half an hour. Tests confirm that this is quite close to accurate. A full charge does take about an hour and forty minutes.. By all accounts the HTC 10 is a solid, good-looking phone that users would feel comfortable using, and music lovers would especially enjoy the audio profile. It has solid performance and great sound. However, the HTC 10 comes in at the same price as other brands' flagship Android phones like the Galaxy S7 and the LG G5 and it just is not quite prepared to take on the stiff competition..

PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page.. View All 8 Photos in Gallery. Wi-Fi performance is a bit slow. Some camera focus issues in low light.. The HTC 10 is the best Android phone for audiophiles and it offers plenty for everyone else too. This could be HTC's big comeback.. A funny thing happened while I was testing the new HTC 10 ($699 for 32GB unlocked): I couldn't stop listening. HTC's latest flagship is the best smartphone for audio I've heard in a long time, although you need to pair it with some really good headphones for the advantages to come through. It's also the first Qualcomm Snapdragon 820-powered unlocked phone available in the US, which makes it the most powerful unlocked phone on the market. When you combine these benefits with a sleek design and attractive software enhancements, you get our Editor's Choice for unlocked phones and a great choice when offered by carriers, superseded only by the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge .. Motorola Moto X Pure Edition (Unlocked). Physical Features and Battery The HTC 10 feels like a big slab of metal at 5.74 by 2.83 by 0.35 inches (HWD) and 5.68 ounces, although it's actually smaller than the Galaxy S7 Edge (5.94 by 2.86 by 0.30 inches); all that matte aluminum gives the impression that it's bigger than it is.. The front of the phone is mostly a 5.2-inch, 2,560-by-1,440 Super LCD 5. It looks about as bright as the AMOLED display on the Samsung Galaxy S7 , but lacks the intense contrast. It isn't always on, but as we saw on the LG G5 , that feature doesn't work well on LCDs anyway. Below the screen, there's a combination home button/fingerprint sensor, which is flanked by capacitive back and multitasking buttons. The body is slightly water-resistant, but not waterproof — don't dunk it.. View All 8 Photos in Gallery. HTC says the fingerprint sensor is the fastest in the industry, and we found it to be slightly faster than the Galaxy S7's, unlocking the phone in 0.4-second as opposed to 0.5. In practice, though, the speed difference isn't really noticeable. The sensor is noticeably more accurate than the S7's, though.. The back of the phone looks like someone heard that iPhones have chamfered edges and said, "You say they like chamfers? I'll give you a chamfer!" It's an ultra chamfera —a relatively large, shiny, angled slide that comes down to a more conventional right angle at the edge of the phone. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but it definitely stands out. The back is domed enough that the phone will rock on a table if you push it. On the side, the power button is ridged to make it easy to find, like the one on the HTC One A9. The phone has a microSD card slot that had no trouble with a 200GB Lexar card, and it charges with USB-C and Qualcomm's Quickcharge 3.0 technology. HTC says the phone can charge 50 percent of its 3,000mAh battery in 30 minutes.. We got 6 hours, 4 minutes of video streaming time, which is solid, if not up to the Galaxy S7's 9 hours. That isn't the whole picture, though: HTC's software bleeds somewhat less battery in standby than Samsung's does, and the phone comes with an app called Boost+ that sips power by reducing the screen resolution when you're playing games. After seven and a half hours in standby, a Samsung Galaxy S7's battery had dropped by 8-10 percent, while the HTC 10's battery had only dropped by 2-3 percent.. Calling and Networking The unlocked model of the HTC 10 supports LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/17/20/28/29/30 and LTE Category 9, which means it will get the fastest speeds and best coverage that AT&T and T-Mobile have to offer. We found this true in our tests, where LTE speeds and coverage were on par with the Galaxy S7 Edge. Qualcomm's TruSignal antenna tuner, introduced late last year, recovers from connection drops much more quickly than last year's devices did. It will also work perfectly on Canadian networks, although it lacks CDMA so it can't authenticate on Sprint or Verizon. For those carriers, you'll have to buy the models the carriers offer directly.. Wi-Fi performance is fine, although it isn't up to Galaxy S7 levels. We got about half the speed we saw on a Galaxy S7 at various distances from our Verizon FiOS test router: 20Mbps down instead of 40Mbps, for instance, or 2Mbps instead of 4Mbps. It was still usable, especially at closer distances. A software update we received in the middle of our testing process bumped speeds up — they were originally even lower — so this may be something that can be further improved in firmware.. Call quality is very good, thanks to vigorous speakers and excellent LTE connectivity. Test calls were clear, loud, and sharp, and the bottom-ported speakerphone was easy to hear outside. The phone supports VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling, and it will support T-Mobile's enhanced EVS codec for even better call quality in a software update, HTC said.. Software The HTC 10 runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with HTC's latest version of Sense. HTC said it's trying to slim down duplicate apps, and that effort is appreciated. The apps HTC kept are a mix of its own and Google's: HTC's camera, Google Photos, HTC Mail, Google Calendar, and Google Play Music, for instance. The only obvious bloatware comes in the form of apps for Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram, which you'll probably use anyway. This is on the unlocked version, of course. Expect US carrier versions to be loaded down with redundant carrier apps.. There are two major, obvious changes from Google's stock Android here. First, if you swipe to the left of the home screen, you get HTC's Flipboard-like News Republic aggregator. And second, in HTC's Theme Store you can download new Freestyle themes, which are so open that they're almost disturbing. You can place icons, widgets, and stickers (oversized icons) willy-nilly. The one Freestyle theme available to start is travel-themed, and way too low-contrast, but it's safe to say this is the least iPhone-like layout I've seen in a long time.. Of the 32GB of internal storage, about 25GB is available. You can always add a microSD card, and unlike the Galaxy S7 or the LG G5, this phone supports Google's Adoptable Storage mode to make the card look like internal storage.. In terms of performance, the HTC 10 is on par with other Snapdragon 820 devices like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the LG G5, with one notable exception: If you use the HTC 10's Boost+ software to knock screen resolution down to 1080p in games, you'll boost your frame rates, too.. Listen Up HTC is well-known for awesome audio experiences. It introduced front-facing BoomSound speakers on the HTC One M7 three years ago, and has since paid attention to things that really make a difference, like headphone amps, as opposed to things that are largely inaudible, like 32-bit DACs.. The HTC 10 doesn't have front-facing speakers. Instead, it has a front-facing tweeter up by the earpiece, and a woofer that doubles as the speakerphone along the bottom. This creates mono sound that's a little hard to measure the volume of, because it's radiating from the whole phone rather than coming out of a specific point. It sounds less tinny than most phones, but not room-filling.. But when you plug in headphones: Wow. The 1-volt headphone amp, more powerful than in the Galaxy S7 or the Apple iPhone 6s , can drive high-end headphones such as the Bowers & Wilkins P5 like no other phone can. The payoff is in gorgeously round, textured, detailed sound, whether you're listening to pop, jazz, or classical. It only gets better as you turn the volume up. The difference is less noticeable in mediocre headphones, so it pays to invest (and you'll have to, since HTC doesn't include any headphones at all). Compared with the HTC 10, audio through the GS7 sounds flattened and subdued.. Headphone audio quality is further improved by a Personal Audio Profile (PAP), my favorite feature Samsung abandoned in the Galaxy S6. PAP surveys your aural faculties and enhances the frequencies where your hearing is slowly fading. The result for me was discovering that there are bass notes in some of my favorite songs that I just hadn't been noticing at all. I almost can't work when using the phone to listen to music, it's that good.. But it gets even better! This is the first Android phone to officially support Apple's AirPlay, the formerly proprietary Wi-Fi streaming protocol that a number of wireless speakers support. In a panel in the settings menu, you can quickly connect to Chromecast, Miracast, and AirPlay devices. The phone can stream video via Chromecast and Miracast, but only do audio through AirPlay. It's a cherry on top of the best audio playback phone available.. Camera and Video The story with the HTC 10's camera is a little bit more mixed than with the audio, and is where the Galaxy S7 pulls ahead a bit.. The HTC 10 can shoot stills in RAW or JPEG, its camera app has some Pro Mode controls (shown below), and it can record up to 4K video at 30 frames per second. It has built-in slow-motion and hyperlapse modes, too. Both of its cameras have optical image stabilization to smooth out videos. Sticking with the audio theme, it also records high-quality audio up to twice as loud as other phones without clipping.. The main camera is a 12-megapixel unit with 1.55µm pixels, which are larger than the 1.4µm pixels in the Samsung Galaxy S7. That should make for better low-light performance, right? Alas, no. The Galaxy S7's f/1.7 aperture, slightly larger than the HTC 10's f/1.8, along with its added focus pixels seem to make a difference.. In good light, photos look great. The differences come out when the lights go down. On a cloudy day, the S7's shots look just a bit brighter and sharper. Very low-light shots on the HTC 10 are a bit noisier than the S7, but more importantly, the phone has trouble focusing in situations where the S7 has no issues, and focus in general is slower. Tapping to focus doesn't change the exposure, which can make taking photos with a dark foreground and a bright background difficult. In addition, the HTC 10 would also occasionally throw an error about me blocking the laser autofocus when I wasn't; HTC says this will be improved in a software update.. The front-facing, 5-megapixel camera, with 1.34µm pixels, has good if somewhat noisy performance. It's a little soft in low light, but at least it doesn't do the irritating super-smoothing thing that Samsung and LG phones do, and it's less noisy than the iPhone 6s.. Comparisons and Conclusions The HTC 10 is the best music phone on the market, and a strong performer all around. Its solid, all-metal body, quick performance, and fast fingerprint scanner make for an elegant experience. Aside from the audio quality, though, we still like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge a bit better. It packs an even bigger screen into an only slightly wider body, it has a larger battery, and more importantly, it has a better camera. Low-light camera performance is a hugely important feature, and the S7 and S7 Edge lead the pack right now.. That said, LG and Samsung hurt themselves by not making unlocked versions of the G5 and the Galaxy S7 available. If you're looking for a high-end unlocked phone with no carrier bloatware in the US, your best choices were previously the Google Nexus 6P and the Motorola Moto X Pure Edition. The HTC 10 outpaces those devices. Its Snapdragon 820 chipset is much faster, and its newer modem handles connection drops far better than the other models. While it isn't running stock Google Android, HTC's Sense has relatively few superfluous apps and is full of new, useful features like AirPlay support. While the HTC 10 is also more expensive than its competitors at $699, you're getting value for that money. That makes the HTC 10 our new Editor's Choice for unlocked phones.. Bottom Line: The HTC 10 is the best Android phone for audiophiles and it offers plenty for everyone else too. This could be HTC's big comeback..

The comeback we've been waiting for. by Joshua Vergara April 14, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. - Super LCD 5 display looks great. - Performance is smooth and snappy. - Incredible sound experience especially with headphones. - Quick Charge 3.0 with solid battery life. - HTC's best ever smartphone camera. - OIS in front facing camera. - HTC Sense is simple, functional. - Metal construction still plenty slippery. - Fingerprint reader disjoints motion gestures. - Boomsound speakers not as loud as before. - Camera doesn't quite match up to other flagships. By refining established strengths (audio and design) and improving core weaknesses (camera), HTC has returned to the flagship arena with the HTC 10, which brings everything the high end market requires in HTC's own signature style.. Display 5.2-inch Super LCD 5 display with curved-edge Gorilla Glass. Processor 2.2GHz quad-core 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. Wi-Fi: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (2.4 & 5GHz). Cameras Rear: 12MP HTC UltraPixel 2 (1.55Âµm pixel size) with laser autofocus, OIS and f/1.8 aperture. Front: 5MP (1.34Âµm pixel size) with OIS and f/1.8 aperture. Quick Charge 3.0 compatible with cool charge. Dimensions and weight 145.9 x 71.9 x 3.0 - 9.0mm. Colors Carbon Grey, Glacier Silver and Topaz Gold. It would be an understatement to say that HTC has hit a bit of a rough patch over the last couple of years. While HTC’s 2015 flagship brought with it everything the company is known for, including an impeccable design and fantastic software experience, the device failed to live up to expectations in key aspects, such as the camera, which was especially disappointing in a year where the competition was particularly focused on camera performance.. HTC may have dropped the One moniker this time around, but are certainly hoping that their latest high-end offering will be the one that results in a reversal of fortune.. Is this truly the complete package from HTC that we’ve been waiting for? We find out, in this comprehensive HTC 10 review!. The all-metal unibody construction that the company is known for makes a return with the HTC 10, but with some refinements and additions to the design language to create some separation from its predecessors. At its thickest point, the HTC 10 is 9 mm thick, which is a bit more than its competition, and the overall footprint of the device is also slightly larger than other high-end smartphones. However, with a subtle change in the backing, the device does sit comfortably in the palm of your hand, and the slightly higher height, width, and thickness will largely go unnoticed.. Up front is where the majority of the difference can be seen between the HTC 10 and its predecessors. Gone are the dual front-facing speaker setup and more importantly, the highly disliked black HTC bar below the display that is seen with almost every other smartphone from the company. While the lack of previously standard speaker setup may be disappointing, the good news is that BoomSound is still around, this time consisting of a front-facing speaker above the display, and a sub woofer at the bottom, next to the USB Type-C port. Just below the top speaker grill is a notification LED, and next to it is the larger front-facing camera package.. On the back, the same great metal material remains HTC’s calling card, but there is a nice change made here as well, with new chamfers all around that give the device a bit of a curve. This is a nice subtle addition to the rear aesthetic, as light reflects off of the edges to provide a silhouetted look.. Of course, the slight curve and chamfers contribute to the handling experience as well, allowing for the device to sit nicely in the palm of the hand, making this slightly wide smartphone easier to manage in one hand. However, the metal does make for a very slippery device, and while that isn’t something new and was seen with previous generations, it can be a bit of a nuisance if you aren’t careful.. HTC proves once again with the 10 that it is very capable of making very attractive smartphones. For fans of previous HTC devices, some elements that distinguished those phones from others have been removed, such as the usual BoomSound speaker setup, and even the dreaded black bar. However, the updates to the design language are enough to please anyone that wanted a more neutral looking smartphone all around, while also differentiating itself from its predecessors.. The HTC 10 comes with a 5.2-inch Super LCD5 display with a Quad HD resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 565 ppi, and making this the first smartphone from the company to feature this resolution. The Super LCD5 display performs well, with high brightness, that allows for easy visibility even in direct sunlight, as well as good amounts of saturation. Granted, it isn’t as vivid as an AMOLED display, but HTC has made sure that this screen adheres to the NTSC standard.. The color temperature can be changed in the settings, but the default option hasn’t raised any concerns thus far. As expected, given the higher resolution, text is very sharp, and gaming is also a joy Â. Speaking of gaming, a nice feature of the Boost+ application is the ability to lower the resolution of certain high-performing games to save on battery life, and when using this, we still had a lovely time playing games on this device. It has to be mentioned that some banding can be seen at certain angles, with the color fidelity also falling a touch. Though these viewing angles won’t be a huge deal to most users, it does take a tiny bit away from what is otherwise a fantastic display experience.. Much like any other flagship smartphone that has been released so far this year, the HTC 10 comes with the latest and greatest processing package currently available. The device is powered by the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, clocked at 2.15 GHz, and backed by the Adreno 530 GPU and 4 GB of RAM.. We’ve already mentioned gaming in the display section above, which has been as smooth as ever, and as expected, this excellent performance is seen across the board. HTC did say that they wanted to have the touch latency to be as low as possible to add to the snappy experience.. However, what is more noteworthy is the streamlining of the HTC Sense UI. Instead of having multiple versions of the same application, as has been the case before, Sense now keeps either the company’s own version, and in other cases, sticks to Google’s iteration. As an example, the device now comes with Google Photos instead of, or along with, HTC Gallery.. The device flies through the various elements of the user interface, without there being any slowdown when loading applications, or switching between them via the Recent Apps screen. We also haven’t experienced any major holes in app performance, with no major crashes, or even lag, to report.. Moving on to hardware, HTC has made a few key additions in this area that further enhance the experience, starting with the fingerprint reader found in the capacitive home button up front. This implementation is similar to what is seen with the HTC One A9 , and works the same way as well. It can sense the fingerprint when in standby, and unlock the device and go straight into the home screens. The scanner is easy to setup and fast and accurate, but as was also the case with the One A9, it poses a bit of a conundrum.. Motion Gestures is still available with the HTC 10, where the phone knows when it has been picked up by the hand, and will then react to a number of different commands. Swiping in different directions directly opens different apps like Blinkfeed, and a new addition is the gesture of swiping down twice to launch the camera app.. However, having the fingerprint reader somewhat eliminates the usefulness of the Motion Gestures, since it doesn’t make sense that you perform a swipe action, and then have your fingerprint scanned anyway. With that in mind, it would have been nice to have an easier gesture to launch the camera, like a double tap of the home button, instead.. The device comes with a standard suite of connectivity options, including NFC. Using the full speaker up top as the phone grill as proven useful, with the call quality being good thus far, and speaker mode provides an even better time with the dual-speaker setup. The only thing that is really missing compared to previous generations is an IR Blaster, and while some users have appreciated its availability before, HTC did mention that it isn’t a widely-used feature anymore.. The audio experience that is possible with the HTC 10 is one of the marquee features of this device. BoomSound is still available, but in a different implementation this time around, with a single front-facing speaker up top, that is paired with a bottom-mounted subwoofer unit that helps provide richer lower tones. This speaker setup doesn’t get as loud as the front-facing stereo speakers from previous generations, but the sound stage has been improved due to the better lower end. However, don’t expect to share the sound with people around you as easily as before.. The headphone jack, centered at the top, is where the magic happens. Plug in a good pair of headphones, or the high-res earphones that are included in the box, and you will hear the difference that the HTC 10 really makes. HTC put a 24-bit DAC and a headphone AMP here to really make BoomSound earn its name.. This also due in part to the available Dolby enhancements, which come in the form of user-definable audio profiles that adhere the sound to your listening habits. These settings are found in the BoomSound section of the Settings menu where, either a few simple questions, or full control over the equalizer, help create these profiles for better listening.. The HTC 10 can really drive headphones, and it is a lot of fun to get lost in the sound. Especially with good headphones, there is no need for a separate DAC or AMP anymore, which is great. Overall, listening with headphones results in some of the loudest, and best quality audio that we’ve ever gotten from a smartphone.. In battery, the HTC 10 comes with a non-removable 3,000 mAh unit, and given that this is current capacity standard with this year’s flagships, it’s no surprise that HTC has followed suit. We haven’t had a difficult time getting a full day of work and play out of this device, with the phone allowing for around 4.5 hours of screen-on time.. Of course, your mileage may vary, but with more frugal usage, it can certainly be possible to get a couple of days of battery life out of this phone, helped along with the battery-saving Boost+ application. This app helps in a few ways, and as mentioned before, allows for games to be scaled down to a Full HD resolution to save power.. HTC does boast the phone offers two days’ worth of battery life, and with its fast-charging capabilities via Qualcomm’s QuickCharge 3.0, a charge for half an hour will give you back one full day of use. The USB Type-C port also helps in this regard, but it is still a standard that we are yet to get used to. You will definitely have to keep a mindful track to make sure that you have the appropriate charger and cable when the battery is running low.. While HTC’s previous flagships may have been up to the mark in other aspects, the performance of the camera has unfortunately been a point of contention, and one of the main reasons for HTC’s poor run over the last couple of years. HTC is hoping to put the past behind them this time around, with the return of Ultrapixels, now in its second generation.. Much like a couple of other smartphone cameras we’ve seen this year, HTC is prioritizing pixel size over megapixel count, and as a result, 12 Ultrapixels is what we get, with a 1.55 micron pixel size. An f/1.8 aperture further bolsters low-light performance, and the camera also comes with optical image stabilization.. The camera application has been streamlined somewhat in its latest version, with all of the different modes found in a single main menu area. Auto-HDR helps get a good shot in almost any situation, and does a pretty good job of knowing when to activate as well. Various modes available include panorama, hyper lapse, slow motion, and more, and work as well as expected. The only real issue with the camera app is when using the Pro mode with full manual control. All the settings occupy most of the space on the viewfinder and covers the frame, until you pick the setting and put the slider away again.. Going back to the camera performance, the change to a lower amount of larger pixels certainly gets the job done, and it feels almost uncharacteristic for an HTC smartphone camera to provide decent shots consistently. Details are captured well in well-lit conditions, and colors are accurately depicted as well. Zoom into any of these pictures, and you will see the noise appear, as is expected from having less detail captured because of the lower megapixel count. This is exacerbated in lower-light conditions, where the exposure might be decent, but details suffer further.. HTC still has a big problem with back-lit subjects, or just about any blown out area in a scene, and is something that even HDR can’t seem to fix in most situations, so you can expect to see quite a lot of flares in situations like this. In low-light conditions, the HTC software usually opts for a slower shutter speed, and as a result, steady hands are still required, even with OIS helping out. All said and done, the consistent quality in most situations makes this a worthy camera companion, as long as you know some of the drawbacks when shooting indoors or at night.. Perhaps the best addition to the camera experience has been the 5 MP front-facing shooter, which also comes with OIS, a first for a front-facing camera, and allows for high-res audio recording when shooting video. While OIS might help with taking selfies in low light conditions, I found its main usefulness when it came to recording videos, such as vlogs.. The stabilization is a great idea for anyone who wants to make selfie videos for social media, or even use the Full HD footage for longer form content. The inclusion of OIS with the front-facing camera is a good move on the part of HTC, and is the HTC 10’s distinguishing feature, compared to the 2K video capture possible with the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the wide reaching wide-angle lens of the LG G5 .. The overall camera experience available with the HTC 10 is far from the best, but it is also by far the best the company has managed in a long time. Unlike its predecessors, there is less rhetoric about how good the camera is and instead, real-world results to prove it. It may not surpass the other flagship smartphones in this category, but this phone camera certainly belongs within the ranks.. On the software side of things, we have Android 6.0 Marshmallow with the latest version of the HTC Sense UI on top. HTC Sense is about the same as it has always been, and given some of the major changes Android has been going through recently, this can be taken as a very good thing.. For starters, an app drawer is available, for anyone fretting about its omission, and is a vertical scroll that is simplistic, but functional. The home screens may have a little too much gap between apps and widgets, but Blinkfeed is still around, and is one of our favorite built-in second home screen experiences, allowing for a good glimpse at the headlines, your social media feeds, and more.. Where HTC tried to streamline things is in the app spread. No longer are there duplicate apps for the same functions, with users getting either HTC’s or Google’s version. For example, HTC’s internet browser is no longer available, replaced by Google Â. The idea behind this is to lighten the load on the phone, but a few questionable choices have been made, such as, the inclusion of HTCs own messaging app, when Hangouts is available, or having a Zoe Video Editor, when Google Photos already creates “highlights” from all of the captures. Nonetheless, the result has been a very smooth and snappy experience, in line with HTC’s claims regarding these changes.. Additions to the software suite include Boost+, an app that can, among other functions, find and clean out junk on the phone, and help with RAM management. As mentioned before, a favorite function of ours is a toggle to make certain high-performing games play at the Full HD resolution rather than Quad HD, which seems to help with battery consumption.. The other addition is in Themes, which is as robust as ever, but now includes a Freestyle layout that doesn’t adhere to grids the way typical Android home screens do. It is an interesting concept that requires special icon or image packs, and with only one of these Freestyle themes currently available, it is still a young feature that needs to be hashed out further.. Aesthetics is always a matter of personal preference, but for most Android enthusiasts, functionality is king, and HTC Sense provides a lot of it. The app drawer is a fan favorite that already elevates this version of Android, and without any overly cartoonish elements or flourishes, HTC Sense is a user interface that simply works.. We might stop short of saying that Sense is our favorite version of Android, but it is certainly nice to come back to something familiar.. We might stop short of saying that Sense is our absolute favorite version of Android, but with all the changes we’ve seen so far, and will continue to see in the future, it is certainly really nice to come back to something familiar.. The HTC 10 is available for pre-order now, and will be shipping in May, with the unlocked version of the device starting at $699. Its main competitors obviously include the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the LG G5, and stay tuned for in-depth comparisons between these three high-end smartphones.. There you have it for comprehensive look at the HTC 10! While retaining some of what HTC is loved for, like the all metal design, the 10 shifts its focus on what matters most, audio and camera, to great effect, and it really feels like this phone has been a long time coming. The sound experience is second to none, proving that BoomSound is not only back, but here to stay.. It might not a perfect 10, but the HTC 10 just might be the comeback we've been waiting for from HTC.. Though the camera may not be the best out there, it is certainly on par with the competition, which is something the company hasn’t been able to claim for a while. What is most compelling about the HTC 10 is that, this year, HTC has managed to find themselves back among the other flagships. It might not a perfect 10, but the HTC 10Â. just might be the comeback we’ve been waiting for from HTC.. HTC 10 vs Apple iPhone 6s/Plus.... HTC 10 vs Google Nexus 6P quick.... HTC 10 vs HTC One M9.

15 tricky HTC 10 problems and how to fix them. You can try using an app like Screen Equalizer to try and balance the color out. Take a look in Settings > Display, gestures & buttons > Color profile and tweak your settings. You can tap the three dots next to your profile to access the slider and make it colder. Some people argue that this is caused by glue that hasn’t dried yet. It should fade away by itself, if that’s the case, but you may be able to speed the process up by cranking the brightness up and placing the phone in direct sunlight for a little. If it’s really annoying you and it doesn’t seem to be fading, then contact your carrier, retailer, or HTC and ask about a replacement handset. Take a look in Settings > Mobile data > Network mode and you might be able to force it to look for LTE. Alternatively, if you’re experiencing battery drain, you could set it to stick with HSPA or 3G. However, this depends on the options you have in the Network mode. Try turning your Wi-Fi on, even if there’s no Wi-Fi network to connect to. Some people report that this seemed to alleviate the LTE issue. It’s highly likely that this will be fixed with the next software update, which should pop up automatically when it’s available. That said, you can always check in Settings > About > Software updates. If you turn your HTC 10 to landscape view you should be able to see it much better. You can always turn the brightness all the way up to make the display a bit easier to read. You could switch to another pair of sunglasses or take them off. For some people, this seems to be related to the screen brightness settings. If you turn the brightness above 50 percent, then the noise should fade away. It may also be worse when the screen background is dark. Some sufferers are reporting that a recent OTA update has solved the problem and stopped the noise. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to have been released universally. You’ll be prompted about new updates automatically, but you can always check if you have the latest in Settings > About > Software updates. You might be able to temporarily fix it by simply turning the HTC 10 off and on again. Hold down the Power button and tap Restart. If the phone is unresponsive, then hold down the Power and Volume down buttons together for at least 12 seconds and it should reboot. Hold down the Power button and tap Power off. Then, remove the SD card, carefully place it back in the SIM tray,. and slide it back into position. Turn the HTC 10 back on and test again. You could try a different SD card. Back up all the content from your SD card on your computer and try formatting it in the HTC 10. You can do this by heading to. tapping the gear icon beside your SD card before choosing Format .. A winning combination of gorgeous design and solid specs should attract plenty of people to the HTC 10. It’s one of our favorite phones of 2016, but as always, no phone is without bugs and glitches. After r eviewing the HTC 10 , and scouring the web for potential problems with the device, we’ve created this list of workarounds and possible fixes. Below are some of the more common issues with HTC’s flagship handset.. Some HTC 10 owners have found a slight colored tint on their displays, which is more noticeable when the screen is viewed at an angle. Most are reporting a pink or red tinge, but some have a yellowish tint.. There have been some grumbles about the strength of the LTE connectivity, as well as problems with maintaining a solid connection in some areas and with some carriers. Specifically, people on T-Mobile with the unlocked version of the HTC 10. seem to be having trouble after a. This might also lead to rapid battery drain.. If you like to wear polarized sunglasses, then you might be disappointed to find that the HTC 10 screen is very difficult to see with them on. The screen will appear black or extremely dark when held in portrait mode while wearing. This is true for most phones that have LCD screens, but the HTC 10’s polarizing filter is orientated so that it impacts your view when you hold the phone in the portrait position.. A few people are complaining that they can hear a very high pitch whine coming from their HTC 10. In a quiet room, or when holding the phone fairly close, they can detect a ringing or high pitch noise.. There are some reports of an issue related to the SD card, where it keeps unmounting or disconnecting from the HTC 10. You might get a pop-up message about it. It’s worth testing the card in another device, just to make sure that it isn’t faulty..

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Lenovo's Yoga 730 is a cheaper 2-in-1 with Alexa support. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. Sony will sell its wireless 'open-ear' buds in the US. Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. HTC 10 review: The flagship the company should have made years ago. The company's new flagship smartphone, the 10 (yes, that's the name, and no, I don't like it either), is a credible contender for Android greatness. I've spent a little over a week using it as my daily driver, and while the name still irks the hell out of me, the device itself doesn't. For a company that has seen some rough seas lately, I'm glad HTC has remembered how to make a great smartphone. The thing is, its competitors haven't been lazing around; they've been upping their game too, and now the contest for the crown is tougher than ever. When it comes to winning hearts, minds and market share, HTC is at a disadvantage. None of us can say what the future holds, but either way, the 10 is a step in the right direction.. Gallery: HTC 10 review | 26 Photos. A more subtle approach to software than on previous HTC phones. First Android phone that supports Airplay streaming out of the box. Camera performance falls short of some rivals. Sound is considerably less impressivewhen you listen through speakers. Hi-res earbuds aren't included with US models. Simply put, this is the best phone HTC has made in years. It's fantastic, though not exactly perfect. While its build quality is tremendous and there's plenty of horsepower under the hood, HTC still isn't quite as good as Samsung at cameras, while the battery life here is hit-or-miss. Still, the 10's lightweight Android skin and great audio performance (in addition to everything else) could make it a better choice for some than either of Samsung's Galaxy S7 phones.. Hewn entirely from aluminum and glass, the HTC 10 is about as well built a smartphone as you'll find. Phone nerds of a certain vintage will remember the thrill that came from picking up the HTC One M7. Indeed, I felt an echo of that same excitement when I first started playing with the 10. That's more than I can say about either of the hero phones HTC has released within the past year.. Still, the 10's design won't be for everyone, especially with strong competition from the likes of Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. It's a bit nondescript when viewed from the front: There's the 5.2-inch Super LCD 5 screen, swathed in a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3, with a fast fingerprint sensor/home button underneath. Flanking the home button are two capacitive navigation buttons; HTC would rather use every millimeter of the screen for content, but I know a few people who'd be less than pleased. Me? I'm not particularly bothered by it: The buttons are responsive, and unlike Samsung, HTC puts the Back and Menu keys in the right place.. Meanwhile, you've got a 5-megapixel camera above the screen, with optical image stabilization (!), along with the earpiece. That earpiece actually doubles as part of HTC's updated BoomSound system; it works in tandem with the speaker on the bottom edge to produce good (but not amazing) sound. We'll get into that in a bit. The rest of the tour is pretty prosaic: There's a USB Type-C port on the bottom for fast charging, SIM and microSD slots on opposite sides and a 12-UltraPixel camera on the 10's back cover.. Those broad strokes might not sound fascinating, but HTC's attention to detail is what makes the 10 feel exciting. A chamfered edge runs around the screen's Gorilla Glass cover, leaving virtually no gap between the glass and the metal. This time, the power button and volume rocker don't wiggle in their sockets. Another chamfered edge on the 10's back has a different finish that reflects light differently, and has the functional benefit of giving your fingers a comfortable place to rest. And unlike the curved backs we saw on the GS7 and GS7 Edge, the 10's more pronounced slope means it settles even more comfortably into the hand. I love the 10's look, and you might not. Either way, there's no denying this is one thoughtfully designed device. Too bad it's not waterproof; just water resistant.. As usual, some of the 10's most important facets can't be gleaned with the naked eye. There's a quad-core Snapdragon 820 chip inside that reaches clock speeds as high as 2.2GHz. That's paired with an Adreno 530 GPU and 4GB of RAM to keep things running smoothly. I know what you're thinking, though: That configuration is about as exotic as cheddar cheese these days. You're right, but even so, those internals generate enough horsepower that you won't see me complaining.. The unit I'm testing is the $699 "open-channel" model that supports T-Mobile and AT&T out of the box (even though the latter doesn't seem interested in selling the 10) and has 32GB of internal storage. Thankfully, the 10 can take up to 2TB of additional storage (good luck finding a microSD card that big). As it turns out, some markets will have more fun than others: a 64GB model will be available ... Meanwhile, people who buy the HTC 10 in the US won't get the hi-res-certified earbuds offered in Europe and Asia.. Samsung is arguably the king of smartphone screens, but HTC managed to put up a decent fight with the 10. As mentioned earlier, we've got a 5.2-inch Super LCD 5 display running at Quad HD resolution. That makes it the first 2K HTC phone to land in the United States. As you'd expect, text is sharp and details abound, but I'm also really enjoying the screen's saturation levels. See, the panels used in Samsung's GS7 line are warm even on the default Adaptive Display setting, while the G5's "Quantum" display can appear lifeless at times.. The HTC 10, on the other hand, manages to chart a course right between the two: Whites take on an even, cool tone, and colors feel lively without getting in your face. And if these colors aren't to your liking, fear not: A quick jump into the display settings lets you swap them for the standard sRGB color gamut, a more conservative option. Viewing angles are great, too, but there's a rub: The screen takes on a slightly reddish hue when you look at it from too far off-center. It's a mild annoyance made more pronounced by how good the screen usually is.. In addition, the screen has one more thing going for it. HTC went with a low-latency panel to reduce the amount of time between when your finger touches the panel and when the panel senses it. It's hard to quantify what kind of difference we're actually getting, but the 10 feels seriously fast nonetheless.. HTC is also jumping on the hi-res audio bandwagon with its updated BoomSound Hi-Fi system. It manifests differently depending on what sound setup you're working with, and, obvious though it may seem, you're much better off with headphones. There are a woofer and tweeter built into the 10, so the phone's speakers produce sound with a nice, clean atmosphere. You've also got the option to switch between movie and music modes, though switching doesn't always make much difference. Sadly, all you'll get from those speakers is mono sound; the sweet, sweet channel separation that came with those old-school stereo BoomSound speakers might be gone for good. Don't get me wrong: HTC's speaker setup is the best you'll find right now; it just lacks the oomph that HTC used to be known for.. Plugging in headphones makes for a different story, though. You'll be asked to set up a personal audio profile the first time you do -- you'll listen for tones with each ear, which will ultimately leave you with a specific setup for your ears and headphones. And yes, you can have multiple profiles for different headphones. The result (in my case, anyway) was louder, slightly brighter audio all around. HTC says the 10 also upscales all audio to 24-bit quality, but some people will get more out of that trick than others.. In a few cases, the LG G5's optional Hi-Fi Plus DAC sounded considerably better, but that could be a moot point, since LG might not bring that module to the US at all. Either way, music fans will be pretty pleased with the 10; it just sucks that we aren't getting those hi-res earbuds in the box when the phone launches in the States. (They're a little too heavy on the bass for me, but still!). The 10 is also the first Android phone that supports Apple's AirPlay streaming standard out of the box. Swiping up on the screen with three fingers launches HTC's Connect app, where you'll find all your DLNA-, Miracast- and now AirPlay-compatible speaker systems in range. Pairing the 10 with my Apple TV was surprisingly painless. A couple quick taps and I was listening to the soundtrack from The Last Five Years on my television. The connection was stable even as I moseyed around the house. The only real downside is that there's currently no way to stream video to the Apple TV.. A few years ago, HTC started reducing the impact its Sense UI had on Android's performance, as well as the general experience. I'd argue that any progress is good progress on that front, but with the 10, it feels as if HTC hardly painted over Android at all. What we've got is the lightest, cleanest version of Sense yet, and it's mostly a pleasure to use.. The core of the 10's software setup is a build of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow (which we've explored in detail here ), but some of HTC's touches are hard to miss. Swiping right on the home screen brings you into BlinkFeed, which still populates your screen with news stories and social updates for when you're killing time in line. Beyond just new tweets and Google+ posts, BlinkFeed is also supposed to offer up recommendations for places around you to eat, drink and be merry, though they never appeared for me.. Gallery: A tour of the HTC 10's software | 28 Photos. As far those home screens go, the only other HTC touch that's enabled by default is the clock widget; even the location-based app suggestions widget has to be manually turned on. (Thankfully, too, those suggestions are much better this time around.) HTC's dark-colored app launcher is still around as well, with options to hide and sort your apps just like always. Minor gripe: You can fit only 20 apps onto a single page (a 4x5 grid), which leaves a lot of empty space around icons.. If HTC's design choices don't suit you, you can still download or create themes for the 10. New this time around are what HTC calls "Freestyle" themes. Instead of having your apps aligned on a grid, you can add stickers of different sizes to your home screen, and even have them overlap. There's only one such Freestyle theme here (the vaguely nautical "Journey"), and while it's definitely not for me, a few children I've shown it to were just tickled.. While we're on the subject of apps, HTC has done a fine job cutting back on its preloaded apps. Think: its browser, Scribble and Polaris Office. There's always been some overlap between HTC's apps and Google's, and the former finally decided to trim the fat, because certain stock Android apps just work better. There's at least one example of Google changing its products to mesh with HTC's dialed-back approach: HTC's Gallery app supported RAW photo files, and now that that's gone, Google's Photos app supports those uncompressed images instead.. However, this shift doesn't mean the 10 doesn't ship with any third-party apps; Instagram and Facebook are here, and carriers will probably go to town with bloatware eventually. HTC also included a resource management app called Boost+ that lets users clear up memory, increase battery life during games and prevent certain apps from launching without first inputting a swipeable security pattern. It's a neat touch, though many people will ignore it all the same. Still, that hasn't stopped HTC from releasing it for other Android phones as well.. Let's be honest: HTC hasn't always had a great track record with its cameras. I was prepared to be let down this time, but that didn't turn out to be the case. While not perfect, the 10's 12-UltraPixel cameras and f/1.8 lens make for a very competent main shooter. If you're not familiar, "UltraPixels" are what HTC calls the larger pixels on its camera sensors (the ones here are 1.55μm big). Since the days of the original UltraPixel camera, though, smartphone makers like Samsung and Apple have also jumped on the big-pixel bandwagon, mostly for better low-light performance.. That slightly technical prelude aside, the 10's main camera captures near-uniformly lovely shots with nicely saturated colors and fine details. I wish HTC had pushed the envelope on resolution, though, and managing your exposure can be a little tricky. See, when you tap to focus on a subject, a small exposure slider pops up for your fiddling pleasure. Dragging a slider isn't as intuitive as tapping to lock focus and exposure, so it's not uncommon to get photos that are a hair too bright compared with the GS7. Thankfully, this is an issue that a future update could fix.. Since I've already started to talk about focusing, I'll note that the 10 uses a laser autofocus module that's sometimes as fast as the GS7's Dual Pixel sensor setup. In favorable conditions (say, outside on a lovely spring day), it's usually a pleasure. Keyword: "usually." Sometimes I'll get an error saying something is obstructing the autofocus module. More often than not it's my finger, but at least once or twice, I couldn't figure out why it was complaining. And when it gets dark, the autofocus starts to struggle a lot more. It'll take a few tries to lock onto what's in front of it, and the resulting photos can be indistinct and smudgy. Samsung definitely has the edge in the dark.. If extra control is what you're after, the 10's Pro Mode is probably where you'll spend most of your time. Sliders give you manual control over white balance, ISO, shutter speed and focus, plus the option to save photos as uncompressed RAWs. Fair warning, though: Saving as RAWs can take two to three seconds longer than with normal JPEGs. It's also too bad the Pro Mode doesn't work when you switch to the 5-megapixel front camera: Who doesn't want meticulously adjusted selfies?. Gallery: HTC 10 camera samples | 25 Photos. Performance and battery life HTC 10 Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge LG G5 AndEBench Pro 16,673 14,168 13,030 14,152 Vellamo 3.0 4,876 4,285 4,152 4,104 3DMark IS Unlimited 26,747 28,529 26,666 26,981 SunSpider 1.0.2 (ms) 608 1547 942 640 GFXBench 3.0 1080p Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 48 45 47 47 CF-Bench 49,891 51,227 46,290 36,488 SunSpider 1.0.2: Android devices tested in Chrome; lower scores are better. Jokes aside, the front camera is surprisingly solid, producing crisp results aided by its optical image stabilization. Just like most recent smartphones I've tested, the 10 also shoots 4K video, though only for six minutes at a time. Resulting clips are bright and nicely detailed, and you can record hi-res audio to go with it if that's your thing. I still have trouble telling the difference, but at least that high-quality audio doesn't add too much to your 4K video's file size.. So far, I've tested two flagship smartphones with a Snapdragon 820 chip, 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU, and both have been terrifically fast. The HTC 10 is number three. Nothing I threw at it over the past week of testing was able to give it pause, from benchmarks to graphically intensive games like Dead Trigger 2 to frantically leaping between apps to see if I could break something. Since all 820-powered phones have a strong foundation to work from, it's the little touches that ultimately make some devices more enjoyable to use than others.. In the 10's case, the combination of HTC's pared-down software and low-latency display tech make for an exceptionally smooth experience -- one that I prefer to LG's and Samsung's approaches. My dear predecessor Brad liked to say (in HTC reviews, even ) that the best measure of a device's power is how often you notice it ... or rather, how often you don't notice it. The 10 has enough horsepower to make sure I never felt lacking for anything, and in that way, all those silicon particulars sort of faded into the background. Speaking of particulars, peek at the benchmarks below to see how HTC's work stacks up:. I only wish the 10 had more consistent battery life. HTC says the 10 can go for up to two days without needing a charge, and that's technically true; it just depends on what you're doing with the thing. My workdays are filled with lots of emails, Slack messages, phone calls and YouTube videos, and the 10 would typically stick around for about 13 hours of relatively consistent use before needing a recharge. Over a quiet weekend, though -- when I mostly used the phone for coordinating plans and listening to podcasts -- the 10 stuck around from Friday night to Sunday night without a problem. Meanwhile, in our official rundown test (looping a video with the screen brightness set to 50 percent and Wi-Fi connected), the 10 lasted just over ten and a half hours.. That means it ranks above the G5 (10.5 hours on the nose) but falls short of the Galaxy S7 siblings, each of which managed 13-plus hours. Curiously, when checking the battery drain over time, there were a few moments when power consumption jumped dramatically, and I can't really figure out why. While you'll get some respectable longevity out of the 10's battery on occasion, it's mostly a mediocre performer in this regard. At least there's a QuickCharge 3.0 charger included in the box that takes the 10 from zero to half full in half an hour.. I've been drawing comparisons between the HTC 10 and Samsung's Galaxy S7 ($649+) and S7 Edge ($749+) this whole time, so let's just address this beef head-on. These devices arguably represent their respective makers at the peak of their design and production prowess, making the choice between them largely a matter of taste. While Samsung's camera performance and battery life are superior to the 10's, I'd argue the 10 is the better-built device, and its much lighter approach to software makes it more pleasant to use. If you're an audio aficionado, you'll also be better off with the HTC 10.. LG's G5 ($629+) is a contender, too, though in many ways it lacks the polish of either the HTC 10 or a Galaxy S7. What it lacks in finesse it tries to make up for with sheer novelty: You can plug in different hardware modules to make the phone more versatile. This strategy might make the phone more useful over time, but it's of questionable value right now. The G5 could be a great phone in the future, but the 10 is the better machine now. Oh, and if you're more concerned about software, there's always the Nexus 6P. Huawei has proven itself as a first-rate phone maker, and the lure of unfettered Android Marshmallow (complete with fast and frequent updates) is worth contemplating. Then again, it has last year's high-end Qualcomm chipset, so those searching for sheer power would do better with a 10.. A few days ago, I wrote about fighting the urge to be too optimistic about the 10. HTC has let me down before, after all. Despite everything, I still walked into this review with a certain set of expectations I quietly hoped the 10 would meet. And you know what? This phone met them, almost across the board.. The HTC 10 is an incredibly well-built device, with top-tier horsepower and -- crucially -- software that doesn't drive me up a wall. The company has also upped its camera game considerably, though the results still fall short of some competitors. Sure, I wish the battery life were a little better, but it's not a deal-breaker. These shortcomings are enough to keep me from calling it the best all-around Android phone out there, but man, it's close. Of course, your tastes might make for a different ranking, so I'll leave you with this: If you're searching for a fantastic new smartphone, HTC 10 is definitely worth a look.. gear , htc , htc10 , mobile , review , uk-reviews , video.

One of the best phones you can buy in 2016 is now my favorite phone of the year.. Anyone can make a phone out of metal. That's not to say it's easy. But at this point there's nothing particularly special about being a metal phone. Or being a metal unibody phone. Or whatever other marketing language we want to throw at it.. What isn't easy is making a good metal phone. You've got metal so thin it feels like plastic. Metal covered in so much paint it feels like plastic. Or a metal phone that looks like every other metal phone out there .. Nobody makes metal phones like HTC, though. Of the company's sins the past few years —. and there have been sins —. Attention to detail in design isn't, either.. And that brings us to the HTC 10 , which quickly was considered by many to be the Taiwanese manufacturer's best smartphone to date, including in our own official review .. It's not perfect, though, and clad in a bit of marketing wizardry.. This is our second-opinion review of the HTC 10.. I've been using the HTC 10 for more than a month. Mostly in Pensacola, Fla., but also in New York City, and a little bit on the road in Canada. I've been using an unlocked North America model (with T-Mobile) supplied as a review unit by HTC. It's running Android 6.0.1, software version 1.53.617.5. (Yes, that's the one with the most recent camera update.). I had the HTC 10 —. which I'm going to refer to as the M10 from time to time —. connected to an LG G Watch or Huawei Watch for the entirety of my time using it.. Few companies do industrial design like HTC. From the days of the Touch Diamond (I'm showing my age here) to the first Android phone (the G1) to the early start of the HTC One era. That continues with the HTC 10.. There are metal phones that keep the weight down in any number of ways, and that keep things pretty slim. The HTC 10 has none of that. It's smaller and lighter than, say, the Nexus 6P and LG V10 — two of the biggest available right now. It's smaller and lighter than the Galaxy Note 5. But there's still something that's just beefy about this phone. Being 9mm thick (at the thickest part, that is) and weighing 162 grams will do that.. With the curves we've come to know and love from HTC's "M" line. The M7, M8 and M9 each have distinctive but unique slopes to their backs. That continues with the M10, of course, only with large, chamfered edges. That major change makes this phone the easiest to hold since the much smaller M7. The matte finish on the metal is still a little too smooth to not be a little slippery, but that chamfered edge makes all the difference.. There are metal phones, and then there are metal phones made by HTC.. That, and it just looks beautiful, particularly on the silver models.. Also worth a mention is the way HTC has burned its logo into the back. You can't feel it at all. And unlike past phones, it's not going to fall out. (Does it get any more embarrassing than that?). The change from front-facing stereo speakers is a big one, but necessary. You can't (and shouldn't) put out a phone these days without it having a fingerprint sensor. And HTC using the combination scanner/home button on the bottom of the front of the phone means something had to give. But instead of just opting for a forgettable single speaker like so many others, we've got treble (higher) sounds coming out the earpiece, and bass (lower sound) firing out the bottom of the phone. It's not really like a true subwoofer —. the mids are mixed way too much for that —. but it works, and it works pretty well. What you get is a way-above-average mono smartphone speaker. It's great for folks speaking —. podcasts and news and the like. Actually, maybe there are times in which it works too well. There are times when I've been on a call (that's the feature wherein you use your smartphone to actually talk to someone, using 10-digit numbers to determine with whom you want to communicate) and the earpiece is just too damn loud. (The HTC 10 also occasionally gets on my lawn, but that's another story.) The speakerphone feature, however, has been a little quiet for my taste. I'm not all that concerned about having 24-bit sound —. HTC including it is better than not, certainly. But I have been very much enjoying the "High-res Audio Earphones" that won't be included with the phone in the U.S. (Elsewhere in the world, it's time to get excited.) They sound great. They'd probably be the best in-box earphones I've ever used, if they were actually in the box in my little corner of the world. (HTC has yet to set a price for them, so I can't weigh in on whether they're worth a splurge after you buy the phone.). There's some serious old school/new school going on in the HTC 10.. Elsewhere on design: I'm digging the look of that bass speaker on the bottom. I'm fine with the slight extension of the camera housing (also known as the z-stack, because it extends on the z axis). I'm loving the look and feel of the power button. That's a small but important thing for making sure you can find it quickly and easily without fumbling —. not always something easily done on HTC's phones of the past.. The HTC 10 display is a little disappointing, especially in sunlight. And Florida gets a lot of sun.. The display on the HTC 10 is good. But I'm not in love with it. I've been spoiled by AMOLED panels in Samsung's phone. And not just because of their ridiculously black blacks (none more blacks) or that I think they just look better than backlit screens at this point. No, the problem is I'm on a polarization kick of late. LCD screens need polarizers to work. and it means that too often my polarized sunglasses mean I can't actually see the screen as well as I'd like. (And occasionally not at all.) Somehow Huawei managed to avoid all this with the LCD panel on the P9.. If that's not a problem for you, awesome. I see a lot of it in Florida. The HTC 10 is the third phone I've used with Snapdragon 820. Heat hasn't been an issue in any of them, and it's not in the HTC 10. Occasionally it'll get warm, but not hot. Raw performance has been fine, too. I don't play games on my phones, though. So, yes, I hope the latest processor can push a UI without issue.. This is a solid one-day phone. Battery life has been the big question with Snapdragon 820, if only because of all the promises Qualcomm has made about "2x" gains in power consumption. Add to that HTC's claim that you can get two days of use out of the M10, and we've got some pretty lofty expectations set.. My take on the battery life has changed a little bit. I've gone from "Two days? Where did HTC get that idea?" to something I think is more realistic. This is the first "all-day" phone I've seen from this current generation of devices. Better for my use than the Galaxy S7. From the time I wake up and unplug, to the time I go to bed. We need to have realistic expectations of a 3,000 mAh capacity —. two days is pretty generous, and does it really count if the phone is all but shut down while you're sleeping? And if I'm on the run and not on Wi-Fi, I can burn through the HTC 10 battery a good bit faster and need to top up at some point.. But if I'm on Wi-Fi most of the day, and get a little bit of charge back on the commute home, I'm easily getting 15 hours of actual use, with 30 percent or 40 percent of a charge remaining.. And that doesn't even take into consideration what I still think is the differentiator in phones today —. Whether it's Qualcomm's branded version or a manufacturer's implementation of faster USB charging (and I don't really care which, so long as it works), being able to get 30 percentage points back in 20 minutes or so is huge. Two-day battery life is moot at this point and is a superfluous marketing message.. — Phil Nickinson ✘ (@philnickinson) April 14, 2016. The more I think about it the more I'm OK with Quick Charge balancing out not-quite all day battery life in phones.. Just 20 minutes on a QC3.0 charger in the car on the way home from the office can get me about 30 percentage points back. A good half-hour or so can get damned near double that.. These phones are doing more and more every day. These processors do more and more behind the scenes. We tend to forget that, and we tend to have unrealistic (and, let's face it, uneducated) expectations. Toss in the fact that HTC has already switched to the reversible USB-C standard , and I'm OK with how long the phone is lasting, and how quick and easy it is to charge.. I don't need "two days." I need one day —. or at least most of the day, with a 20-minute top-off.. When I called for a Sense revamp, this wasn't what I expected. Another big change for HTC here in the software department. It's scaled back Sense a good bit —. to the point where Sense no longer even gets a version number. (But if it did, it'd be Sense 8.) That's not to say you won't find changes. The default launcher still has HTC-style folders and a custom app drawer. But it's all completely usable, and it's no longer trying too hard. (The ability to put folders within the app drawer is still great.). I used HTC's UI for more than a week. I'm no longer using it though because I prefer a different launcher. In any event, the single most important thing you can do to do your phone is make it yours. Don't just use what they give you. What HTC has is fine, but it's HTC's. (And Google's, I guess.) Make it yours .. The biggest improvement, I think, is in the notifications. HTC has gone full Google on that front, which gives the most room for notifications without taking up room with quick settings. If you've yet to experience this particular bliss, a single pull down shows your waiting notifications. Keep pulling and you get quick settings. Or just pull with two fingers to get straight to the quick settings.. That's the only scheme that works. Anyone who does anything different is wrong.. HTC still has a bunch of software gimmicks this year, though — which is odd considering if you do a Google search for "HTC 10 gimmicks" you'll find a number of entries from folks about how the HTC 10 doesn't have gimmicks.. If a company tells you its product has no gimmicks — guess what. Sure, it's got HTC "BoomSound" with Dolby Audio. And it's got a whole (excellent) themes ecosystem. And new "freestyle" themes that break free of the home screen grid. (The kids are gonna love it.) And this ridiculous "Boost+" app that promises to manage your memory and storage and stuff better than Android does. Or the "Lock apps" feature inside Boost+, which will password protect any app of your choosing, which is a great idea. (But is still an additional gimmick.) Or the fact that HTC pushes a "simple" four-digit PIN for security instead of something longer and more secure for security. Or the useful HTC Connect feature that makes it easy to stream music to other sources —. And there's the BlinkFeed news reader that's still in the launcher. So you can't say the HTC 10 doesn't have gimmicks —. even if more than a few of them are genuinely useful features. (I guess you can say it —. but I want to know why.) Where the line really comes from, I think, is that HTC and Google worked together to cut back on the number of duplicated apps, which is great. There's no separate Gallery app anymore (though it will be made available in Google Play if you want to use it). Instead, Google Photos is integrated into the camera application. Some folks are fine with that. So in some instances you get HTC apps. In others you get Google apps. It's not a bad mix at all.. And, finally, a big (yet niche) reason why the HTC 10 is staying in my pocket for the foreseeable future —. it works great with Android Auto. (Somehow Samsung screwed that up with Marshmallow.). The camera app (and the camera itself) is the area that's gotten the most attention with the HTC 10. This is a completely new camera app for HTC. And for the most part I'm digging it. There's nothing specifically difficult about it or anything. It's got all the modes you'd expect, and they're easy to flip though. (Though I've found that the "auto" mode. just called "Photo" is sort of annoyingly far away when I want to switch back to it from another mode.) Having the HDR option on top of the UI instead of buried behind a menu or two is a big improvement. I'd probably like to have the ability to swipe the screen to flip between the front and rear cameras, like other apps do, but that's not a huge deal.. The bigger change is in how the HTC 10 focuses and sets the exposure level. Most phones let you top on the screen to do both at once. The HTC 10, however, takes into account what's in the entire frame when setting exposure. That can be difficult when subjects are backlit. And the focus (laser-powered as it may be) is a little hit and miss. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get things right. (HTC's addressing that, it's told us, and also will tone down the annoying "there's something in front of the laser" message, which was extremely sensitive at first.). I'm mostly getting some pretty good pictures from the HTC 10. (I'm keeping a running album of them here .) Not all of them are perfect. The phone is pretty aggressive on ratcheting up the ISO in low light, which leads to noisier pictures. But if I'm really worried about that I can hop into manual mode.. All in all I think HTC has a really good camera here. It doesn't saturate as much or sharpen as far as Samsung's camera does. I think the LG G5 is better about handling low light. But the HTC 10 certainly is a vast improvement over the M9. It doesn't make me want to carry a second phone. And the camera app itself is greatly improved. It's maybe not quite the best camera app we've used, but it's definitely among the top, and a vast improvement from HTC's past efforts. I do take a little issue with that DXOMark thing rating the HTC 10's camera the same as the Galaxy S7. I don't think the end result is as good, nor is the camera app quite as easy to use (it's not far behind, though) or as full-featured. The two swipes down to launch the app is clever, but not as quick as I'd like it to be. (It's definitely not as fast as Samsung's home button method, or LG's volume rocker.). The HTC 10 has a really good camera. 3 in my list, behind the GS7 and the LG G5 —. and that's a really good position to be in these days.. Where to buy the HTC 10. This is a very good smartphone, and worthy of your attention, and your money. But also true is the refrain we've sung year after year. Having a really good device is one thing. (With the added complication of its flagship phone not always being HTC's revenue driver.). I don't think the HTC 10 is as good a complete product as the Samsung Galaxy S7. (Water resistance and Samsung Pay are a big reason for that thought, in addition to the camera.) But the best phone doesn't always have to be your favorite. And as far as Samsung phones come in my mind the past year or so (I've been very happy with the Note 5 and GS7), it's good to have an HTC phone in my pocket again.. A couple other considerations: HTC's done pretty well with its Android updates. That it's available unlocked is another plus —. and is something Samsung doesn't do in the U.S. And unlike the GS7 (and Samsung's other Marshmallow-running offerings) it works with Android Auto. That's a small but important factor for me.. So there's a whole lot done right here. And I hope HTC is able to build and then ride that wave.. The HTC 10 will be available direct from HTC, and from independent retailers in the United States, Canada and the UK. In the U.S., it's available on T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint , in Canada it'll only be offered on Bell , and in the UK it's been picked up by EE and Three, as well Carphone Warehouse as the usual unlocked sellers..
