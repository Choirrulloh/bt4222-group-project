The detailed specifications, photos and introductory video of the BLU Studio J2 (STJ2). The list of the competitors most often compared to the BLU Studio J2 smartphone.. 2017 に発売された BLU Studio J2 (STJ2) スマートフォン。Mediatek MT6570 チップセット、512 MB のラムと 8 GB の内部記憶装置によって動きます。. BLU Studio J2 はそのまま Android OS v6.0 (Marshmallow) で動きます。Li-Ion 2000 mAh の電池を搭載します。 480 x 854 px の解像度を含んで、5 インチ の IPS 表示を売り物にします。IPS テクノロジーは、世界で最も主要な LCD テクノロジーの1つです。. BLU Studio J2 はそのまま Android OS v6.0 (Marshmallow) で動きますが、Studio J2 のファームウェアは OS の新しいバージョンに更新されることが出来ます。. 斜めに角から角まで、スクリーンサイズはインチで計られます。 480 x 854 px の解像度を含んだ 5 インチ IPS の静電式タッチパネルはマルチタッチ可能です。. スマートフォンのメモリー (512 MB) は拡張出来ませんが、記憶装置 (8 GB) は microSD カードで拡張されることが出来ます。. このスマートフォンは内蔵した GPS 受信機を持っています。GPSは、地球の正確な地理的な位置の決定を可能にする衛星に基づくナビゲーション・システムです。 この BLU スマートフォンは FM ラジオ受信機を持っています。. スマートフォンのセンサーは物理的な量を計ってアプリケーションプロセッサに送信します。 携帯の加速計は傾きと動きを計る内蔵した電子部品です。 近接センサーはユーザーが通話中に携帯を顔の近くに持っていることを探知して、キーパッド・プレスと表示からの電池の消費を防止するため表示をオフにします。 Studio J2 はデュアル SIM 可能なので、異なる SIM カード二枚を挿入することが出来て、同じ携帯から両方を使えるということです。.
