The Nokia Asha 230 is a small, low-cost phone that runs the Asha platform – which powers Nokia’s cheaper mobiles. Asha phones are often geared towards developing markets, but a £40-odd price and touch interface could well see it win a few fans in the UK.. We took as closer look at MWC 2014 to see what it’s about.. The Nokia Asha 230 is a tiny, stubby phone. It’s chunky, and comes in several of the Lumia series-favourite colours – including green, yellow, blue and red as well as the less ambitious black and white.. It is, predictably, a plastic phone. Build quality is better than many ultra-budget phones, but you’re not going to be impressing anyone down the pub with this mobile. It is pretty cute, though, in a sort of chubby runt-of-the-litter way.. Little extras like matching the colour of the volume and power buttons to the body show that this is a Nokia phone – not a budget phone from some brand no-one has ever heard of. Like the Nokia X Android phone, there’s just the one front control button – a little arrow that acts as a back/home button.. In-hand, the Asha 230 feels oddly small. It’s not often we see touchscreen mobiles with tiny screens these days.. The screen is perhaps the part hardest-hit by the phone’s low budget. It’s a 2.8-inch, 240 x 320 pixel screen. These sorts of specs used to be common 8-10 years ago, but now seem positively antiquated.. They leave the Nokia Asha 230 with a very blocky-looking display. It’s really this, rather than the immediate look of the Asha system, that betrays this as a ‘feature phone’ grade device, rather than a smartphone. The software is also a bit sluggish.. The Asha 230 also misses out on some smartphone-essential features. There’s no 3G – just EDGE/GPRS – and no Wi-Fi. However, it does let you get on-board with many things you’d want to do with a smartphone. There’s WhatsApp support, Facebook and Twitter. The phone has 4GB of internal storage and a microSD socket, making it a potential little music player.. Other specs are very basic, though. The rear camera has a 1.3-megapixel sensor with a fixed focus – incapable of producing remotely good photos. And the 64MB of RAM shows you how intensive the Asha system really is.. If you value flexibility, you’ll be able to do a good deal more with a low-cost Android. They’re already available for under £50.. The Nokia Asha 230 is a cute phone that looks and feels better than many £40 phones. However, the poor screen and limited hardware/software mean it’ll be of limited appeal to UK buyers..

The Nokia Asha 230 announced at Mobile World Congress 2014 is squarish, colorful, and costs only 45 Euros.. by February 24, 2014 5:27 AM PST. Nokia Asha 230 shows off teeny-tiny touchscreen. CNET's full coverage of Mobile World Congress. BARCELONA, Spain -- Of the new Nokia phones announced at Mobile World Congress, the Nokia Asha 230 is the only one to run the company's Asha mobile platform.. Although this is a decidedly entry-level Asha "smartphone," the 230 carries over the same apps that you'll see on other Asha phones, such as the unique-looking 503. It also uses the same two-screen layout that includes an apps home screen and the Fastlane display.. Nokia's Asha 230 for the cost-conscious and the dual-SIMed (pictures). Physically, the Asha 230 looks a little different than past designs. It's squarer than we're used to seeing, and it feels proportionately wide in the hand. Rounded corners are common in phones, but matched with the phone's shape, it comes across looking bubbled and "cute" to the eye.. The Asha 230 comes in the screaming colors we now associate with Nokia. I saw it first in vibrant green, and dang, it'll get you noticed. You can also pick it up in yellow, red, cyan, white, and black.. Related stories Hybrid Nokia X is Android, but not as you know it Nokia X OS: An Android-Windows Phone mess Basic Nokia 220 costs only 30 Euros Why the Nokia X is great for Microsoft All the news from MWC 2014. As a budget device, the trade-off between pricing and features is apparent the moment you cast your eyes on the phone's 2.8-inch, 320x240-pixel screen. It looks low-res right off the bat, with fuzzy icons.. The 230's price/performance hot-potato is also apparent in the 1.3-megapixel camera that Nokia chose, which has an even lower resolution than the 2-megapixel shooter used on the far simpler Nokia 220 cell phone. At this image resolution, casually sharing photos online will be the best use for pictures taken on this phone.. Device storage is 4GB, but you can expand it by up to 32GB more through the microSD card slot. For some markets, Nokia will even throw in an extra SIM card slot, for a dual-SIM device.. Nokia talks Asha, Android (and Windows Phone) at Mobile World Congress. As a bonus, the 230 will launch with Nokia's new Asha 1.4 software update, which integrates Twitter messages into the Fastlane stream, adds Nokia's Mix Radio service for Pandora-like music complications, and helps you navigate the treacherous world of selfies by listening to your voice guidance on how to center your shot. This last feature may be new to the Asha series as a whole, but it made its debut on the Asha 301, which launched at MWC last year.. By the way, other Asha phones will get the software bump sometime in April.. Nokia also underscores its relationship with Microsoft and its ecosystem by way of Microsoft OneDrive integration in the Asha 230. As a reminder, OneDrive was until very recently known as SkyDrive and nets the phone owner 7GB of free cloud storage.. The Asha 230 retails for 45 Euros ($60, £37) and will start selling almost immediately, hitting its first global markets in the first week of March. Because of its squatter dimensions and lower-end specs (like that hazy resolution), the 230 already isn't my favorite Asha phone -- not by a long shot. Yet, it is a sturdy-feeling device, and the Asha 230's price isn't just competitive, it's aggressive.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

All WhatsApp News, Downloads, Reviews and more!. ← Archos 45 Helium 4G. 14 February, 2015 10 April, 2015. WhatsApp » WhatsApp Nokia » Nokia Asha 230. The one and only Nokia Asha 230 WhatsApp Download. Straight from the start, WhatsApp has grown rapidly in terms of number of users. Millions of people all over the world send millions of free WhatsApp Messages every day. Sending free WhatsApp Messages and making free phone calls. These are the main advantages of the great WhatsApp Messenger App. Completely free to download and 100% commercial-free!. Ok nice, so you own a Nokia Asha 230? And you want to use the WhatsApp application on it? Please, read this page very carefully. WhatsApp mainly focuses on the new operating systems such as Android and iOS. The Nokia Asha 230 runs on a quite outdated OS that can be considered as a neglected OS. Before you try anything, first read this post carefully.. Have you ever wondered what year the Nokia Asha 230 is presented on the smartphone market? The answer is: February 2014. Yet we see that this device is still not disappeared from the scene. People aged 20 years and older know them very well: The Nokia Asha 40 phones. That is very characteristic for this device. Now we will furtger zoom in on the features which relate to WhatsApp for Nokia Asha 230. This device stands out due to its clear and relatively large 2.8 inches, 240 x 320 pixels display. It offers a lots of overview. Watching pictures and movies just works fine. Just like any other phone, the Nokia Asha 230 offers a decent internal storage capacity. To be more specific: this device offers 64 MB of internal memory. Sufficient for the download of some Apps, photos, contacts and messages.. There are always people who do not have enough storage by only using the standard internal storage. If you need it you can easily expand the memory of this phone with 32 GB. Unfortunately, this device offers only a 64 MB RAM RAM chip. Therefore, you can experience a real slow phone that crashes a lot. Nowadays, we send more and more pictures and messages to our friends and family using our mobile phone. This is done via Apps like WhatsApp. This device has a decent 1.3 MP, 1280 x 960 pixels camera. The quality is not exceptional, but for the average user the quality is sufficient. The Nokia Asha 230 has a nice and long battery life because it offers the exclusive Li-Ion 1020 mAh battery (BL-5C). Very convenient if you are on the go and you can’t charge while you are traveling. Now we have discussed the main features of this device. But it is also nice to report that this phone has some additional nice options like Accelerometer, proximity, A-GPS only, Stereo FM radio, MP4, MP3, 320p@25fps video.. These are great to use with external Apps like Instagram or WhatsApp.. Download WhatsApp on a Nokia Asha 230 is not recommended. We have looked into all the capabilities of this smartphone and listed the reviewed points below. The Download WhatsApp process goes a lot smoother on Blackberry, Android and iPhone devices.. 3.4 (67.43%) 614 votes. Check instantly our special test results of WhatsApp for the Nokia Asha 230 .. WhatsApp Download for the Nokia Asha 230. Should i do this or not?. WhatsApp is a comprehensive application that requires a lot of performance capacities of a phone. It is not obvious that everything just works smoothly.WhatsApp has a number of minimum requirements. In this review we actually analyse the extent to which the Nokia Asha 230 fits to these requirements.. About the launch date and software Recently, the manufacturer reported that they have sold millions of this type of phone. Quite a lot, right? This phone was already introduced in February 2014 Nokia Asha 40, that is the software version of this phone. According to the website of WhatsApp these devices are not supported by their service.. Do you want to know more about the screen and the memory of this phone? The Nokia Asha 230 is very disappointing in terms of display resolution. This device offers an 2.8 inches, 240 x 320 pixels display with moderate light reduction so you can not see much in the sun. But is my internal storage of 64 MB able to compensate the outdated software of my device? No, that is not an option. The software is the most important aspect. WhatsApp just doesn't support this old software. Therefore you are unable to download and install the App. Moreover, you can expand the internal storage with another 32 GB. Useful and practical for pictures, photos or music. We are not really convinced of the RAM memory. There is a 64 MB RAM chip located in this phone. So not really suitable for multitasking. Playing with the 1.3 MP, 1280 x 960 pixels camera is not boring. Looking at the camera, the Nokia Asha 230 performs really well. Decent photos and lots of filters to give your photo an unique effect.. If you want to know more specs and details of other phone you can read our reviews about. What we have to say about the battery and other special features The device has the revolutionary Li-Ion 1020 mAh battery (BL-5C) positioned under the hood.

Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (April 2013) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ). The Nokia Asha series was a range of low-end feature phones produced and marketed by Nokia. The name "Asha" comes from the Hindi word meaning "hope". On 3 September 2013, Microsoft announced its purchase of Nokia's mobile device business, with the deal closing on 25 April 2014. The company previously announced an intent to use Asha as an "on-ramp" to the Windows Phone platform, [2] [3] but in a company memo released in July 2014, it was announced that as part of cutbacks, Microsoft would end the Asha and Android -based Nokia X range entirely, in favor of solely producing Lumia Windows Phones and Nokia-branded "feature phone" products. [4] On 11th January 2018, HMD Global acquired the Asha brand name. 1 List of devices. 2 Nokia Xpress Browser. 3 Asha on Linux project. Below are the mobile phones in the Asha range. None of the Asha models have GPS functionality. All Asha phones include an FM radio .. The Asha 305 and Asha 311 models are known as the first generation of Asha Full Touch phones; the second generation is the Asha 50 x line. All devices up to the Asha 50 x series run the Nokia domestic operating system with Series 40 UI platform, also known as S40. The Asha 501 (released in May 2013), Asha 500, Asha 502, Asha 503 and Asha 230 (announced on 14 February 2014) are powered by the Nokia Asha platform , which builds on S40 and Smarterphone. Nokia 206, 207, 208, and 301 are not part of the Asha series as they do not carry the "Asha" branding, despite mistakenly being marketed as such by carriers and retailers.. Nokia Xpress Browser uses intermediate Nokia proxy servers to optimize web pages based on the capabilities and screen size of the device. The proxy servers also compress data to reduce data transmission charges for the mobile user. Like the Opera Mini , the Nokia Xpress browser decrypts and compresses HTTPS traffic, routing it through Nokia's own servers. [28] This practice seeks to provide faster browsing for users of feature phones and smartphones with lower processing power and thus lower bills for mobile data usage. [29] However, as pointed out by researcher, this raises serious privacy concerns, because Nokia is essentially "performing Man In The Middle Attack for sensitive HTTPS traffic" and temporarily decrypting user data—which could be sensitive financial information, passwords. [30] The company admitted to the technical details, but stated, "Claims that we would access complete unencrypted information are inaccurate". [31] GigaOm criticized Nokia, which, unlike the Opera Mini, has failed to make it clear that HTTPS traffic will be decrypted during transit. It recommended that Nokia learn from Amazon's Silk browser, which leaves HTTPS traffic undisturbed. See also: Nokia X and Lumia_series §. According to The Verge , Nokia had a project referred to as Asha on Linux and also as "MView"—a reference to Mountain View. The project used a fork of Android on a low-end handset to maximize margins. The project resulted in the Nokia X family of devices, unveiled at MWC 2014. It was one of two known Android projects at the company, the other was running the OS on high-end Lumia hardware.

The Nokia Asha 230 is the most affordable Asha touch device till date. Just like other Asha devices, this model is set to come in Lumia style color variations like green, yellow, red, cyan, white, and black. The device has dimensions of 99.5x58.6x13.2mm and weighs in at 89.3g which is pretty light. This is the smallest Asha device till date. It is well-built, feels sturdy and has a pebble like form factor. It sports a 2.8 inch TFT LCD touch screen with a QVGA (320x240 pixels) resolution and a pixel density of 142PPI. The display has a 4:3 aspect ratio and supports 262k colors. As soon as you see the screen, it is pretty evident that it's a budget device due to washed out colours and fuzzy icons on the display. On the outside, the phone has a volume rocker, power/lock key and a back button on the front.. The Nokia Asha 230 features a 1.3 megapixel primary camera without flash. It supports a resolution up to 1280 x 960 pixels. It is a fixed focus camera with 3x digital zoom and has 3 camera modes; Photo, Video, Self-timer. The camera is good enough only for casual image sharing as it lacks quality. Images lack proper colour reproduction and the dull screen doesn't help either. The camera is capable of capturing videos at 15 frames per second but then again it isn't great quality either due to cost cutting for this budget device. Video playback formats supported are 3GP and MP4. The phone doesn't have a secondary, front-facing camera. The phone has a speaker at the back which gives decent undistorted sound output. The phone also has a 3.5mm stereo headphone connector. The device has a FM tuner so that you can listen to live radio streams. It comes with support for all the usual audio playback formats like WAV, MP3, MP4, MIDI and AMR.. As a major cost cutting move, Nokia has decided to give Wi-Fi and 3G a miss for the Asha 230. So basically it supports GPRS and EDGE as means to connect the device to the Internet. Evidently, the browsing capabilities will be limited by speed. The device supports Bluetooth 3.0 for file transfer. A dual SIM variant of this device is expected to come to select markets. The device has Nokia's Xpress browser which helps with enhanced UI and easy navigation. There is also the Nokia Nearby app for navigation purpose.. The phone has a 1020mAh battery which offers 11 hours of talk-time and an awesome standby time of 33 days. These are pretty good figures nowadays compared to other devices. The device is power efficient due to its small screen and limited connectivity options. The device has a inbuilt memory of 4GB and is expandable up to 32GB with a MicroSD card.. Please ask the question in above box. Can I use WhatsApp in this phone?. Yes, you can use WhatsApp in this phone.. No, it doesn't support Jio SIM.. How convert 2G to 4G network?. This question has no answers yet. User Reviews of Nokia Asha 230. 306 Ratings 3 Reviews. 5 185. 4 43. 3 21. 2 19. 1 38. Rate & review this product and help other customers.

You’ll also find an innovative home page on the Xpress Browser, letting you choose from tabs that launch entertainment and videos, social media, news, apps and more, so you’ll never waste time looking in the wrong place..

1 – 18 of 58. A decent all-rounder, the dual-camera Nokia 8 gets the job done, but it doesn’t come close to today’s true Android stars.. The Nokia 3 sacrifices too much processing power to achieve its low price. You’re better off spending a bit more on the Motorola Moto G5.. With a neat design, a low price and power enough for the essentials, the Nokia 5 is budget Android done well..

The 4.3-inch X2 is Nokia's second crack at an Android phone, but Android fans won't find it very familiar.. Bogged down by sluggish performance and a lacklustre UI, the Nokia X only disappoints.. The Nokia 225 is a feature phone giving you a splash of Lumia colour without splashing out.. Boldly colorful and solidly-built, the straightforward Nokia 220 was designed to look and feel great while making calls.. The Nokia Asha 230 announced at Mobile World Congress 2014 is squarish, colorful, and costs only 45 Euros.. Buy the Nokia Lumia Icon for its beautiful display and well-rounded features, but skip it if you require gobs of storage, are on a budget, or prefer a power user's OS..

Microsoft Mobile Oy (originally Nokia ). unknown, descendant of Series 40 [1]. Asha Platform 1.0 [ edit ]. Asha Platform 1.1 [ edit ]. Asha Platform 1.2 [ edit ]. Main menu interface of the Asha platform. The Nokia Asha platform is a mobile operating system (OS) and computing platform [2] designed for low-end borderline smartphones , based on software from Smarterphone which was acquired by Nokia. The platform inherits UI similarities from Symbian , Maemo and MeeGo , and replaces Series 40 on Nokia's low-end devices. [3] The user interface design team was headed by Peter Skillman, who had worked previously on webOS and the design of MeeGo for the Nokia N9 .. It is the successor to the Meltemi project which Nokia was developing as a Linux platform to replace Series 40, but was cancelled in July 2012. The first phone based on the platform is the Nokia Asha 501 , and were followed by the Asha 500 , Asha 502 Dual SIM , and Asha 503 , all announced at Nokia World in October 2013. [5] Another phone, the Nokia Asha 230 was announced on February 24, 2014, comes pre-installed with Asha platform 1.4.. Apps for the platform are either made using Java ME , or as web apps , which are rendered by the Nokia Xpress browser which uses the Gecko rendering engine. [1] The mobile operating system lacks true multitasking but the radio and music app can run in background mode (which is advertised as multitasking), while swiping to fastlane apps will actually close down previously opened applications instead of minimizing them. It features a notification centre , named Fastlane , which is accessible by swiping to the left of the home screen.. The platform is supplemented by the Nokia X software platform , Nokia's customised version of Android, seen on the Nokia X , which draws cues from the Asha platform, including the Fastlane notification centre. In a company memo released in July 2014, it was announced that as part of cutbacks, Microsoft would end the Asha, Series 40, and X range entirely, in favor of solely producing and encouraging the use of Lumia Windows Phone products. 1.1 Asha Platform 1.0. 1.2 Asha Platform 1.1. 1.3 Asha Platform 1.2.

The Verge commented that the platform may be a recognition on the part of Nokia that they are unable to move Windows Phone into the bottom end of smartphone devices and may be "hedging their commitment" to the Windows Phone platform. The Asha Platform's main competition is Firefox OS , and Samsung's Java-based REX platform ; [13] both of which are also optimised for low-end handsets. Furthermore, entry-level Android handsets are also competition to the platform. ^ a b "Nokia Asha — Platform overview". Archived from the original on September 3, 2013.

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. Chris Davies - Feb 24, 2014. We’ve always had a soft-spot for Nokia’s Asha range here at SlashGear, and the Asha 230 is no different, an even smaller, more affordable point of entry to the Finnish company’s well-designed touchscreen handsets. Paring back the pricing even more, thanks to skipping 3G and WiFi, the Asha 230 (and its dual-SIM variant) is the smallest Asha touch model yet, fronted by a compact 2.8-inch QVGA touchscreen.. In the hand, it’s another sturdy and tactile device from Nokia, wrapping up Lumia-style colors in a pebble-like form-factor. The display is hardly the best we’ve seen, and can look washed-out when you look at it side-on, but the Asha OS is fairly responsive and typing wasn’t too arduous despite the diminutive dimensions.. That’s good news, since Nokia is pushing the idea of messaging hard with the Asha 230. WhatsApp and LINE are preloaded, among other apps, and combined with the lengthy battery life it could be a solid little communications tool. Unfortunately sending anything more than text is likely to be a slow-going, given the sluggish data options.. Nonetheless, there’s something appealing about Asha Touch, even if we’d now rather step up to the Android-powered Nokia X (though admittedly it’s twice the price).. Best of all, the Asha 220 debuts Nokia’s newest Asha Touch OS, version 1.4, with features like 7GB of OneDrive storage, Mix Radio access (though not much use without WiFi or 3G), and an updated Fastlane. It boosts the slightly-smart credentials of the platform, and will be rolled out to 500-series Asha phones from April.. Nokia Asha 501 hits shelves as Asha Touch makes emerging markets play.

Nokia 220 and Asha 230 hands-on. Nokia made the most headlines with the Android-powered X line of devices (X, X+ and XL) but did push the boundaries of affordability with the Nokia 220 and Asha 230. Both feature dual-SIM versions as well.. We got to spend some quality time with the 220 and Asha 230. The 220 starts at an insanely-low €29 while the Asha 230 starts at €45. Both devices we handled at the Mobile World Congress were yellow in color. Jump after the break for the impressions and images.. The Asha 230 is a full-touch operated device – even the back button is capacitive. There are physical unlock and volume keys too. It has a 2.8″ of the same QVGA (320 x 240) resolution and clocks in at 142 pixels per inch. The Asha 230 includes Nokia’s Glance screen tech, a slap in the face of the Lumia 520, which lacks it. The Nokia 220 has a 2 MP camera on the back.. The plastics used in the Asha 230 feel even lesser in quality compared to the Nokia 220. The Asha 230 is heftier at 89.3 g.. The screen looks okay at these parameters. Asha’s UI operation is a little stuttery probably due to the lower-end specs.. The Asha 230 comes with a 1020 mAh battery that’s good for 33 days of stand by time according to Nokia. Talk time over 2G is rated at 11 hours. To complete the tally there’s a 1.3 MP camera on board.. The Nokia 220 is a non-touch device which focuses on the bare essentials in order to accommodate the €29 price tag. The 220 comes with only 2G connectivity, skipping even Wi-Fi along the way. It does, however, feature preinstalled Twitter and Facebook. The plastic used in the 220 isn’t the best but feels okay to the touch.. At this price point we can’t really expect miracles, the phone is very thick at 13.2 mm for starters. The UI is fluid enough and the buttons are good and those not enamored with touch-operation will love the full numpad. The 2.4″ QVGA LCD offers an unimpressive 166 ppi but has good colors. The 220 weighs a manageable 83.6 g.. The Nokia 220 is available starting today while the Asha 230 will hit the first wave of shelves in March..
