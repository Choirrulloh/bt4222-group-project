Liquid X2, Acer called it, when it clearly should have been the Acer Liquid X3. Now, we understand how the smartphone comes to replace the X1, but how did they miss out on a chance to name a triple-SIM device the X3, even if it skips a digit? Yes, the Acer Liquid X2 has multiple SIM slots, three of them.. Okay, to be fair, Acer already had one triple-SIM offering - the Liquid E700 - and it had the Trio moniker slapped to its name in some markets. Apparently, the company is no stranger to creative naming, it just chose to keep it simple for the Liquid X2.. Anyway, the number of SIM slots quickly reveals the price-conscious nature of the smartphone. Even if you had any doubts about it, the 720p resolution of the 5.5-inch display does well to squash them.. That said, the budget constraints have luckily not affected most of the other areas. The Mediatek MT6753 chipset is a reasonably powerful performer, there is a respectable 32GB of storage on board, and RAM is at a far-from-entry-level 3GB. There are also a couple of 13MP cams, one on the back, and one for selfies, and each gets an LED flash - not what you'd call skimping.. Powering the smartphone is a generous 4,020mAh battery (removable too), because what good are all these radios if they drill through your power pack in half a day of standby. A nicely balanced overall package, then.. Looking at the above lists, users of multiple carriers or multiple numbers with the same carrier will find plenty to like about the Acer Liquid X2. Perhaps its biggest shortcoming is the low pixel density, but that's understandable, it just needed to fit it into the budget. And just because we have twice the ppi in some flagships, doesn't make the X2's 267ppi all that terrible.. Of course, the above is based solely on the spec sheet, before we've even opened the box. That's exactly what we're going to do on the next page, where our usual routine begins.. Unboxing, 360-degree spin, hardware overview 3. Telephony, messaging and text input 7.

Acer's Liquid X2 is a speedy, near-stock mid-ranger with a massive battery. It might not be as head-turning as the latest Android flagships, but Acer's doing a lot right in its latest mid-level offering.. Acer isn't a brand name you'd typically associated with fast, pure Android handsets with a minimal amount of software bloat. But the Taiwanese company's latest Android phone, the Liquid X2, delivers impressive performance, a near-stock Lollipop experience and the possibility of epic longevity. We got an early look at the phone today at Computex 2015 in Taipei. Check past the break for more.. Externally, the Acer Liquid X2 draws more than a little inspiration from Sony's Xperia Z line of premium Android phones, with a flat, glossy back and rounded, metallic sides. However unlike that line of phones, the X2 is fashioned entirely out of plastic, not glass or metal. While it looks reasonably good for a mid-range phone, the illusion is shattered when you pick it up.. It's also remarkably light for its size, and considering the fact that it's rocking a 4,000mAh battery. Paired with a 64-bit octa-core MediaTek CPU (Acer isn't saying which one), the phone should boast phenomenal battery life.. Around the front, there's a 5.5-inch "HD" display — and yes, the lack of any qualifier next to that means it's 720p. It doesn't look horrible — in fact the colors are vivid enough and the brightness was sufficient to contend with the overbearing show lights. But make no mistake: you're not getting the cutting edge of smartphone display tech — not by a long shot.. Acer's new UI is basically stock Android, augmented by the lightest sprinkling of custom apps.. Acer's new software might be the most interesting part of its latest phone — in part because there's not a whole lot to see. The UI is basically stock Android 5.1 Lollipop , with very little of Google's OS encumbered by unwanted software. Acer has added its own extra panel to the home screen launcher, however, in what's essentially a clone of HTC BlinkFeed. The "left panel" as it's called shows you calendar appointment, news and weather alerts and social feeds, complete with customizations to tweak the amount of each on offer. Beyond that and the Acer camera app, the X2's software is very, very close to Google's vision of Android.. Acer is the latest manufacturer to decide that front cameras matter just as much as their rear-facing counterparts — local rivals ASUS and HTC have already taken a crack at selfie-centric phones with the ZenFone Selfie and Desire EYE respectively. And now Acer joins them with 13-megapixel cameras on the front and back. Photographic capabilities are difficult to judge at a trade show, but Acer's customized camera app was quick to load and speedy to capture photos from either camera.. We don't have pricing or availability details for the Acer Liquid X2 yet, nor any confirmation of a release outside of Asia. What we do have, however, is an example to other manufacturers targeting the mid-range space: speed and UX quality are of paramount importance — and there's no reason a less expensive phone should have to settle for second-rate UI and performance. Throw in an enormous battery, and it's easy to see why Acer could be onto a winner with this intriguing new mid-range handset.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

more ... more .... more ... more .... posted by John V.. Tags :. Hands-on - Hands-on + Android - Android +. You have the big boys, and then you have the small fish in the sea – that’s how the smartphone market rolls nowadays. The big names, of course, include names like Apple , Samsung , LG , and HTC , they’re the ones expected to deliver quality, high-spec’d smartphones. On the other hand of the spectrum, we have the other handful who are either taking it slow, or rushing to gain a foothold. Acer has never been a notable player in the space, especially here in the US, but abroad in markets like Asia and Europe, they still retain a decent following. During Acer’s most recent press event in New York City, the company teased its Acer Liquid X2 – a phablet of sorts that looks mighty attractive. Unfortunately, though, the units were all locked down under glass, so we’re only able to catch glances of the upcoming phone. First, let’s talk about the specs! Here’s what you can expect from this one From what we can gather, the Liquid X2 features some sort of textured pattern with its casing. It’s tough to discern, but we do like how the handset’s surfaces are uniformly flush – so there’s no hump or bulge near or around the camera. Also, it appears that there’s either some kind of glossy finish to the casing, or possibly some other kind of protective material. Either way, the various colors it’s going to be offered in helps to provide prospective buyers with some options. Even though very little was mentioned in regards to the software, the units on hand were showing off the optional Quick Touch Flip covers – similar to some of the smart covers we see with other phones. Essentially, this case has a long opening along the front, where various notifications and apps are accessible. For example, there were ones offering access to the phone’s connectivity options, another one that allows us to make an audio recording, and even one for the weather. However, we’re unable to determine the look of the actual display, since none of them were really on. Other notable aspects of the phone include its beefy 4000 mAh battery, which should help propel this phone to carry folks throughout the day. In addition, global trotters will especially take a liking to its Tri-SIM support. Dual-SIM phones are obviously useful for the business minded users, as one is used for personal, and the other for work. However, with the addition of a third SIM slot, you can now add another phone number – good for when you have to travel on vacation or something. The Acer Liquid X2 reads like a formidable smartphone, but Acer will need to be aggressive about its roll out here in the US, in order for them to be respected amongst its peers. So far, there’s no word yet on its pricing or availability. So, what do you think about the phone?. 5.5-inch display 64-bit octa-core processor 13-megapixel auto-focus rear camera with f/1.8 aperture lens 13-megapixel front-facing camera Tri-SIM support 4000 mAh battery Quick Touch Flip.

I would be interested in this phone along with the recently announced Lenovo K80 with the same size battery. The new Asus Zenfone 2's have great specs and a low price as well, but only an average size battery, too bad.. Want to comment? Please login or register ..

Liquid X2, acer smartphone called it, when it clearly should have been the acer smartphone Liquid X3. Now, we understand how the smartphone comes to replace the X1, but how did they miss out on a chance to name a triple-SIM device the X3, even if it skips a digit? Yes, the Acer Liquid X2 has multiple SIM slots, three of them. Okay, to be fair, Acer already had one triple-SIM offering - the Liquid E700 - and it had the Trio moniker slapped to its name in some markets. Apparently, the company is no stranger to creative naming, it just chose to keep it simple for the Liquid X2. Anyway, the number of SIM slots quickly reveals the price-conscious nature of the acer smartphone. Even if you had any doubts about it, the 720p resolution of the 5.5-inch display does well to squash them. That said, the budget constraints have luckily not affected most of the other areas. The Mediatek MT6753 chipset is a reasonably powerful performer, there is a respectable 32GB of storage on board, and RAM is at a far-from-entry-level 3GB. There are also a couple of 13MP cams, one on the back, and one for selfies, and each gets an LED flash - not what you'd call skimping. Powering the smartphone is a generous 4,020mAh battery (removable too), because what good are all these radios if they drill through your power pack in half a day of standby. A nicely balanced overall package, then.

Sure, you probably don't need a smartphone with a massive 4,000mAh battery and a trio of SIM card slots, but thanks to Acer, your author can't stop thinking about one. Acer's so-called Liquid X2 is clearly well-equipped to play globetrotter, but (just like the Predator tablet ) the company's spokespeople were awfully light on the details. Still, we know it comes with a 5.5-inch screen and a 64-bit octa-core processor thrumming away within its surprisingly sleek frame, along with a pair of 13-megapixel cameras nestled high along its face and back. At last, a device that takes selfies as seriously as HTC's Desire Eye .. Gallery: First look at the Acer Liquid X2 | 12 Photos. Can't stop ruminating on those SIM slots, can you? It might seem a little ridiculous -- because it is -- but that's nothing new for Acer. It's been pushing tri-SIM phones since last summer when it pulled back the curtain on the Liquid E700 and now that predilection for threeway connectivity has migrated to a phone you might actually want to buy. Too bad no one was willing to talk price yet.. Alas, the only units to be found on-site were tucked away in an acrylic box, far from my prying, sandwich-stained fingers. On the upside, though, the X2 will be accompanied by a slew of Quick Flip covers in a slew of colors that leave a strip of screen unobscured to give you quick status updates and tidbits of information. With a little tweaking, you can coax them into telling you how much storage space is being eaten up by your photos and music for instance, or providing you a quick Airplane Mode toggle for when you jump on one of your interminable flights. There's no word yet on whether the Liquid X2 will never claw its way out of Acer's native Asia, but it's certainly not impossible.

Acer takes a big Leap into wearables and brings the Liquid X2 phone along. Acer Liquid X2 and Liquid M220. Liquid Leap Fit, Active, and Curve. Acer held an event in New York City Thursday. to show off a handful of devices coming to the U.S. Among the devices that’ll be coming stateside are a new phone called the Liquid X2 and a trio of new fitness trackers called the Liquid Leap Fit, Liquid Leap Active, and Liquid Leap Curve. The company also announced that the Liquid M220 Windows Phone we saw at Mobile World Congress is now coming to the U.S.. Here’s everything we know so far about the new mobile devices from Acer that are headed to the States.. Last year, Acer unveiled its first phablet and the first phone with three SIM card slots. The Acer Liquid X2 builds on them, essentially by smooshing those two phones together. X2 sports a 5.5-inch screen, a 13-megapixel camera with an f1.8 aperture, and a 64-bit octa-core processor. In addition, it’s also got a huge battery, which is something Acer is pretty proud of.. “The X2 is really really a combination of these good things,” said ST Liew, President of Acer’s smartphone group, at the event in NYC’s World Trade Center. “And we’ve slapped in there a 4,000-mAh battery. This baby is going to last a long long time.”. A flip cover offers a slim, vial-shaped window into the LCD screen, allowing a variety of bits of information to pop through, from music and battery life, to email info and so on. There’s no word yet on the rest of the specs or pricing for this phone.. Acer also official announced that the entry-level Liquid M220 with Windows Phone 8.1 is coming to America. The phone has a 4-inch display with 233ppi (pixels per inch), a 5-megapixel main camera, and a 2-megapixel selfie cam, which can also be voice operated. It only costs $80 and will hit stores in June.. Last year, the company unveiled the Acer Leap fitness band. This year it is announcing three new wearables in the same family, with a focus on improving people’s health, Liew said. The products have three goals: looking great, fitting into the lifestyle, and improving people’s health.. The Liquid Leap Fit is a fitness booster with a 1-inch touch screen, a heart rate sensor, and a stress sensor with gold-plated sensor pads for galvanic skin response. A second device, the Liquid Leap Active, is a sporty touchscreen based wearable with similar specs. The third device, which is called the Liquid Leap Curve, sports the same specs as the Fit, but has a different design style.. “This one here is cloth based,” Liew said. “And this one here is a really really cool design. The wearable space is a focus area for Acer.”. Acer is also in “deep exploration” with other companies with similar interest, he said..

Connect your Android to your computer. Run One Click Root and let the software. One Click Root Devices ACER Acer Liquid X2. Safely Transform Your Acer Liquid X2 into a Head Turner Device. Acer called it Liquid X2, when it supposedly been called the Acer Liquid X3. The Acer Liquid X2 sports multiple SIM slots, and it's three of them. Acer already had one triple-SIM offering on their Liquid E700 model and it had the Trio moniker slapped to its name in some markets. Though the company is no stranger to creative naming, they just chose to keep it simple for the Acer Liquid X2. Externally, the Acer Liquid X2. resembles more than a little inspiration from Sony's Xperia Z lineup of premium Android phones; a flat, glossy back and rounded, metallic sides. But unlikely, the X2 is fashioned entirely out of plastic material, and not glass or metal. It still looks reasonably good for a mid-range phone and the illusion is shattered when you pick it up. It's also light for its size, and considering the fact that it's rocking a 4,000mAh battery which is quite powerful battery. It's paired with a 64-bit octa-core MediaTek, the device should boast phenomenal battery life. In front, there's a 5.5-inch "HD" display. It doesn't look horrible though, in fact the colors are vivid enough and the brightness was sufficient. But don't get it wrong: you're not getting the cutting edge of smartphone display tech. Acer's new software might be the most interesting part of its latest phone and the UI is basically stock Android 5.1 Lollipop, with very little of Google's OS encumbered by unwanted software and it's. The "left panel" as it's called displays calendar appointment, news and weather alerts and social feeds, complete with customizations to tweak the amount of each on offer. Other than that’s, the Acer camera app, the X2's software is very, very close to Google's vision of Android. The local rivals ASUS and HTC have already taken a crack at selfie-centric phones with the ZenFone Selfie and Desire EYE respectively and so now Acer joins them with 13-megapixel cameras both on the front and back. And the Acer's customized camera app was quick to load and speedy to capture stunning photos from either camera. Besides, there's always a way to get it done better, with some fix and tweaks through the so called "rooting". Rooting basically unlocks the device true potential; maximize its usability as well as its functionality. Through gaining root access, everything after that moment will be almost near limitless, possibilities and customizations are at hand. On the bad side, the process isn't too simple, rather it's complex, complicated, and risky; it voids your warranty automatically, and may brick your device, that difficult.

The smartphone comes with dual 13-megapixel cameras. Triple-SIM Acer Liquid X2 Launches in January 2016. Acer Liquid X2 (5 Images). It will be released in Asian countries initially. Even though Acer's smartphones are far from being among the most popular on the market, the company continues to launch new devices each year.. After announcing its new Windows 10-powered flagship smartphone, the Jade Primo , Acer is gearing up for the release of a mid-range Android handset that comes with an unusual feature that is not commonly available in today's devices.. Malaysian blog SoyaCincau reports Acer plans to launch a new mid-range Android smartphone next month. The Acer Liquid X2 will be available for purchase beginning January 2016 though we don't have any details on price yet.. The phone's selling point is the fact that it offers triple-SIM support, which means users will be able to insert up to three SIM cards inside the Liquid X2.. We believe that the name Liquid X3 would have fit much better, in this case, but Acer's official name follows the lineup the company initiated with the launch of Liquid X1, back in September 2014.. Aside from the fact that it offers triple-SIM support, Acer Liquid X2 comes with some other features that might appeal to Android fans.. For example, the smartphone packs a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera with autofocus, LED flash and video calls, as well as a 13-megapixel camera in the front for selfies and video calls.. Also, Acer Liquid X2 will be powered by a high-capacity 4,000 mAh battery. It's also worth mentioning that all three SIM cards can be used on LTE networks, though not simultaneously.. Another interesting piece of hardware inside the Liquid X2 is the 64-bit octa-core MediaTek processor coupled with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory..

When will be announced the Acer Liquid X2 availability. and when will start shipping ?. Will Acer make also a 6” version ?. There is a news that ACER is struggling with this phone and might cancel it but keeping an offical silence as will cause huge embarrsment.. According to this thread this phone is no longer going to be released.. Liquid X2 launched in Philippines on Oct 22 during a roadshow:. Hopefully now it will be available soon.. Liquid X2 has not been launched in Philippine. It was just part of the roadshow but and not any of ACER's website. Company Management is highly irresponsible by not telling the truth about cancellation of this product since it will face huge embarraseemnt particularly having held many roadshows including US.. Having posted a few times, ACER management being irresponsible not responding if this phone will be lauched or not. How sad that a Corporation of the stature of ACER will treat its clinets so badly.. Since Acer is silent, can any one reconfirm this news Liquid X2 will be launched in January 2016 in Asia.. i bought this phone in Hong Kong. I bought in Malaysia, it is slim and lightweight cover flip cover included. Regretfully it does not offer different ring tones for different sims unless I am missing something. Also since I am using Windows Lumia on which you can reate tiles for separate email account, it is not possible do it on this phone.. Absolutely no sign of it in the UK, I guess I live in a backward country. As for buying it, it is well out of date in every way, as for support, none existant, as for genuine Acer covers, I doubt you can even get them, I would think the phone is already end of life. I have a E700, so talking from experience.. I would think its already End Of Life well by now, same as the original E700. So no OEM replacement covers, or support for it now..

Acer Liquid X2 With 4000mAh Battery, Triple-SIM Support Launched. Robin Sinha , 24 April 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Acer on Tuesday launched a new smartphone - the Acer Liquid X2 - but has not yet revealed pricing and availability details.. Showcased during the company's New York press conference, the Acer Liquid X2's claim to fame is its massive 4000mAh battery and its ability to support three SIM cards. Notably, Lenovo this week also unveiled two smartphones with a 4000mAh battery, the Lenovo K80 (which also has 4GB of RAM) and the Lenovo A5000 .. The triple-SIM Liquid X2 houses a 5.5-inch display with no word on the display resolution, and is powered by an unknown 64-bit octa-core processor. The handset also includes the same camera on the front and rear - a 13-megapixel offering with a f/1.8 lens.. ( Also See: Acer Liquid Jade Z, Liquid Z220, and Liquid Z520 Launched at MWC ). The firm additionally showcased the Liquid X2's Quick Touch flip case with a vertical slot in between, which gives access to music controls, weather, time and other functions without opening the flip cover. Given the triple-SIM support and 4000mAh battery, Acer says the smartphone is made for those who travel a lot. Not all the specifications are known for the handset, including the Android version it will ship with, but more should be revealed closer to release.. Acer last month also launched its first Windows Phone 8.1 smartphone, the Acer Liquid M220. Acer, which has previously made Windows Phone 7 - powered smartphones, has added that the Liquid M220 will also be upgradeable to the recently announced Windows 10 OS by Microsoft ..

more ... more .... more ... more .... Triple-SIM Acer Liquid X2 to be released in January. Triple-SIM Acer Liquid X2 to be released in January. posted by Florin T.. Tags :. Back in April, Acer unveiled an interesting smartphone called Liquid X2 , without saying when and where it would be released. Now, we're hearing that the handset is ready to be launched starting January (yep, that's in 2016). According to Malaysian website SoyaCincau, Acer confirmed that the Liquid X2 would be available starting the first month of 2016, at least in Asia. Design-wise, the Acer Liquid X2 resembles a Sony Xperia handset. It's not a high-end device , but it can hold three LTE-ready SIM cards (that's a rarity when it comes to phones made by well known companies), and includes a generous 4000 mAh battery. These two features alone might be valuable to many customers out there. The X2 also offers a 5.5-inch display with 720 x 1280 pixels, two 13 MP cameras (on the front and back), a 64-bit octa-core MediaTek processor (unknown model), near-stock Android , 3 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of storage space. The smartphone comes with a special flip cover that lets you peek at notifications without opening it. At the moment, there's no word on the price of the Acer Liquid X2.

Standard 3.5mm headphone jack, 24-bit/192kHz DAC, Dolby DTS HD certification. Not quite enough resolution for the screen real estate. Liquid X2, Acer called it, when it clearly should have been the Acer Liquid X3. Now, we understand how the smartphone comes to replace the X1, but how did they miss out on a chance to name a triple-SIM device the X3, even if it skips a digit? Yes, the Acer Liquid X2 has multiple SIM slots, three of them.. Okay, to be fair, Acer already had one triple-SIM offering – the Liquid E700 – and it had the Trio moniker slapped to its name in some markets. Apparently, the company is no stranger to creative naming, it just chose to keep it simple for the Liquid X2.. Anyway, the number of SIM slots quickly reveals the price-conscious nature of the smartphone. Even if you had any doubts about it, the 720p resolution of the 5.5-inch display does well to squash them.. That said, the budget constraints have luckily not affected most of the other areas. The Mediatek MT6753 chipset is a reasonably powerful performer, there is a respectable 32GB of storage on board, and RAM is at a far-from-entry-level 3GB. There are also a couple of 13MP cams, one on the back, and one for selfies, and each gets an LED flash – not what you’d call skimping.. Powering the smartphone is a generous 4,020mAh battery (removable too), because what good are all these radios if they drill through your power pack in half a day of standby. A nicely balanced overall package, then.. Looking at the above lists, users of multiple carriers or multiple numbers with the same carrier will find plenty to like about the Acer Liquid X2. Perhaps its biggest shortcoming is the low pixel density, but that’s understandable, it just needed to fit it into the budget. And just because we have twice the ppi in some flagships, doesn’t make the X2’s 267ppi all that terrible.. Of course, the above is based solely on the spec sheet, before we’ve even opened the box. That’s exactly what we’re going to do on the next page, where our usual routine begins.. The Acer Liquid X2 arrives in a rather common-looking retail box with the device printed on top. There isn’t a whole lot inside but the basics are covered – a USB cable, AC adapter (5.2V/1.35A) and a handset are all there is inside.. The Acer Liquid X2 is no compact device. Measuring 153.3 x 78.8 x 8.5mm, it’s pretty wide for its screen diagonal, with even the Zenfone 2 ZE551ML more than 1.5mm narrower. It’s also taller by a smidgeon than the regular 5.5-inch Zenfone 2, but if you compare it to the Zenfone Selfie ZD551KL, the Liquid X2 wins by some 3mm.. Then there’s the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note, which is equally tall, but has capacitive keys to show for it. It’s also more than 2mm narrower, making it a lot more manageable than the actual size difference suggests.. The Liquid X2 weighs 166g and that’s about right for what it is. Competing Zenfones are a tiny bit heavier at 170g, while the Vibe K4 Note with its 158g is a little lighter. None of those comes close to the X2’s battery capacity, though.. The Liquid X2 sports a rather generic design, though it does have a few fine touches that reveal it as an Acer device, to the initiated at least. Otherwise, a sharp-edged rectangle with only subtly rounded corners, the X2 is a smartphone like any other.. It’s an all-plastic device, but is trying hard to hide it, and not without success. The rear panel, for instance, poses for brushed metal, much like the Zenfones it competes with for the same market. The cover is pretty hard to remove, and requires some serious nail strength to pry open, but that’s infinitely better than falling off on its own – we approve. A flip cover is available, which replaces the regular rear cover and has a cutout the shape of an old-school elevator door.. Brushed metal look • Back cover removed • Flip cover. The camera lens and the flash look at you from cutouts in the panel, in the top left corner. The lens ring sticks out slightly above both the panel and the front element of the lens, so the glass should be safe from scratches if you put the phone face down on the table.. At the rear bottom, you have a wide speaker mesh but there’s only one speaker behind it, about half the size of the mesh.. Camera and flash in the top left • Loudspeaker down below. Up front, the display is surrounded by a checkered pattern that perhaps aims to mask the rather thick bezels. The chin, for example, big as it is, would have looked even larger had it been a solid color. Or least that’s what we think.. Checkered pattern in the ample bezels. While the bottom bezel is devoid of function (on-screen navigation buttons), the area above the display is pretty busy. Located in the center, the earpiece is the signature Acer design, the plughole looking less obtrusive on a handset this size, than it does for rear mounted loudspeakers.. In the upper left corner you’ll find the front-facing camera, and midway between that and the earpiece is the LED notification light. To the right of the earpiece you have the ambient light and proximity sensors, and the front facing flash. Symmetry freaks will find little to fall in love with here.. “Wherever you find room on the PCB, we’ll make a cutout for it in the front panel”. The power button and the volume rocker are on the right side of the phone and, with the card slots under the hood, there’s nothing on the left side.. Buttons on the right • Nothing on the left. The microUSB port is at the bottom, and Acer insists on putting it off-center. Next to it is the mic pinhole. On top you have the 3.5mm jack and the secondary mic.. microUSB port on the bottom • 3.5mm jack on top. In hand, the Liquid X2 does feel a bit bulky thanks to those large bezels, but also because of its flat back. The relatively flat sides do provide substantial area to hold on to, which is nice because the back is rather slippery.. The Acer Liquid Jade X2 is equipped with a 5.5-inch IPS display. Its 1,280×720 resolution is rather low by today’s standards – the most obvious victim of cost cutting. That said, 267ppi is still okay, if you’re not going to be reading tiny texts.. In the other areas we measure though, the screen is actually an okay performer. Its maximum brightness is good for the class, only bested by the Moto X Play. A touch brighter blacks still don’t send contrast down the drain – in fact, it’s on the good side of average. The minimum brightness is rather high though, at 13.5 nits.. Color reproduction is decently accurate – the average DeltaE of 5.8 is only slightly off the flagship G5’s 5.6. The grays are mostly accurate, cyan probably the most distant from the truth.. There is a proprietary mode for enhancing photos in the gallery, called LumiFlex, which we found to be working in other apps as well. It dynamically alters contrast based on the content on the screen. While the premise is nice, in practice we found it to perform quite inconsistently.. The standard DeltaE 2000 deviation is used to describe the accuracy of the screen’s color rendition. We test the screen with a set of over 100 different color and grayscale patterns to determine the accuracy of the color reproduction.. Even when a phone’s screen color reproduction is off, you would still have a hard time noticing a color cast without a reference as the human eye is quite quick to adjust and normalize colors.. Also, the display colors are a matter of personal taste and perception so consider this test data only if you are concerned about presenting color-critical content on the mobile screen.. Any deviation above DeltaE 2000 of 10 is considered a highly visible error in color reproduction on the display. A DeltaE 2000 deviation between 4 and 10 is considered okay or acceptable color performance. A DeltaE 2000 deviation below 4 is considered good, but professional color calibration requires a deviation between 1 and 2.. It’s out in the sun that the Liquid X2 doens’t fare all too well. Its result is better than the Zenfone Selfie that we tested, and similar to the Zenfone 2 ZE551ML and the Xiaomi Redmi 3. The Moto X Play is miles ahead, but that’s one of the better-scoring non-AMOLEDs in our test.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (MediaTek) :. The Acer Liquid X3 is a triple SIM device, so you have flexibility in terms of carriers and plans. The three microSIM compartments are under the rear cover and they all get 2G connectivity. Only one card gets 3G/4G, but you don’t need to worry about it when putting the cards in – the networks are managed in the options menu.. Additionally, the cards are not active at the same time. If you’re taking a call on one card, and someone rings you on another, the call would just be forwarded to the active SIM card which may or may not be what you’d like depending on your usage case.. Naturally, you get Wi-Fi, but it only operates on the 2.4GHz band, and there’s no Wi-Fi ac. There’s GPS with A-GPS, Bluetooth v.4.0, and an FM radio receiver, but no NFC.. Wired options include a microUSB port and a 3.5mm jack. The microUSB port can be used to attach an external accessory as it supports USB On-The-Go.. Under the rear cover of the Liquid X2 you’ll find a large, flat 4,020mAh battery. It blocks access to the SIM cards, so you may need to pop it out quite often. The capacity is pretty generous, and well above the competition, but then again, it needs to be in order to keep all those radios running.. Indeed, the Liquid X2 proved to be a dependable performer in terms of battery backup. In both tests where the display stays on, the smartphone is good for a little less than 13 hours – excellent numbers. What’s not as impressive is the endurance in 3G voice calls, but even so, upwards of 15 and a half hours should still be more than enough for even the busiest days.. We do measure standby battery drain, and even though it’s not included explicitly in the scorecard, it has its influence on the overall rating. In the case of the Liquid X2, having three SIMs inside inevitably takes its toll, and the otherwise excellent 85h endurance rating gets a 20-hour hit when you put all cards inside – still acceptable.. An Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML lasts virtually the same on a call, but is otherwise no match for the X2 with around 8 hours on the web and half an hour more of video playback. The Lenovo Vibe K4 Note outlasts the Acer model by more than 3 hours of talk time, but again, its 9 hour score in the two other tests is far from what the X2 is capable of.. The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you’re interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we’ve tested will compare under your own typical use.. The Liquid X2 boots Android 5.1 Lollipop with an Acer layer on top. The company’s skin leaves most stock interface elements unaltered, but does introduce changes in some areas, and those aren’t necessarily all for the better.. Anyway, the lockscreen is very much standard-issue, with a clock, notifications and shortcuts to dialer and camera, which work with any side swipe, not just from the corners. Past that are the usual homescreens with folder support and an app drawer – unlike many makers that put all apps on the homescreens Acer sticks with the two-tiered approach. There’s no search or sort functionality in the app drawer, though.. We have a minor niggle with the folder implementation, which hinders their functionality. They are represented as a deck of icons, and you can only clearly see the top one, and barely distinguish the next two, and that’s it. Why not have 6 or 9 tiny icons, so you forget what’s where, you can tell by color and shape?. Lockscreen • Homescreens • App drawer. The leftmost pane next to your homescreens is sort of an information hub which can pull news for you, remind you of incoming events and aggregate social network messages. You can even set its as the default homescreen.. The task switcher is the regular Lollipop one, with a button to kill all apps.. The notification shade is one of those interface elements Acer could have done better. Pulling it down, you get 7 toggles and shortcuts on top, followed by notifications. You can pull a second time to expand the toggles, you need to press the “More” button, which also takes up a space for a toggle.. The brightness slider is accessed from there as well, and there’s no Auto toggle. We know there isn’t one in stock Android either, but if you’re going to change something, why not make it better.. On a positive note, Acer has added multi-window functionality and float apps. The former works a lot like Samsung’s implementation, but you can initiate it in a different way.. When you’re in an app that supports multi-window, an icon appears to the left of the back button in the navigation bar. You tap that and the app shrinks to half the screen size with the other half offering you a choice of recently used apps and a complete list of all apps that support it. You can resize the windows, and swap them, and it also works in landscape. You can’t have two instances of the same app, though.. On top of that (literally) you can have what Acer calls Float apps, and Sony calls Small apps. Well, those are small floating instances of the regular apps, which display above all other content on the screen, and include a simple calculator, calendar, browser and camera, among other things.. Remember that flip cover we mentioned in the hardware section? When the phone is in standby, the screen is off, but wake it up and it displays a clock and battery lever indicator. Double tap and you launch the camera, though the tiny strip is perhaps not the best means for accurate framing.. From the default state you can slide up or down and it gives you some neat shortcuts. You can enter airplane mode, fire the flashlight or mute the sound. Additionally, when you’re on the weather panel, a press-and-hold action gets you a minute-by-minute weather forecast until the end of the day.. The Acer Liquid X2 is powered by the Mediatek MT6753 chipset – one of those non-Helio models by the Taiwanese chipmaker. Its forte in radio connectivity aside, the SoC comes with a rather standard-issue octa-core Cortex-A53 CPU with the cores clocked at up to 1.3GHz in the X2 (Mediatek quotes a 1.5GHz maximum). There’s a Mali-T720 GPU on board with four shader cores and RAM is a liberal 3GB.. Business as usual, we kick off with GeekBench, which is a reliable gauge of raw CPU performance. Here the Liquid X2 posts numbers in the middle of the pack, with the MT6753 clearly behind the Helio X10 – the 8 Cortex-A53 cores may be the same, but the 1.3GHz vs. 2.0GHz clock rate difference inevitably shows, and the Redmi Note 3 (Mediatek) obliterates the X2 in multi-core. Even the Snapdragon 650-equipped Redmi Note 3 has a clear edge.. The X2 does inch ahead of the highest-specced Zenfone 2 and also bests the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note (with the same MT6753 inside). The Zenfone Selfie and Motorola Moto X Play with their Snapdragon 615’s rank even lower.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Helio X10) :. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (S650) :. Acer Liquid X : 2 2972. Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML (Z3580) :. In the single-core test the Cortex-A72 is in a league of its own – the score of the S650-powered Redmi Note 3 is more than twice as high as what a modest 1.3GHz A53 can do inside the Liquid X2. The Meizu m3 note has the A53 clocked at up to 1.8GHz, and beats the X2 comfortably, but the Vibe K4 Note is again a notch behind the Acer offering.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (S650) :. Moving on to compound benchmarks, the Liquid X2 ranks in the middle of the table. In Basemark 2.0 it inches ahead of the Moto X Play, and outperforms both the Vibe K4 Note and the Samsung Galaxy J7 (last year’s). The Zenfone Selfie is on top of the X2 in this one, but both Redmi Note 3’s are way out of reach.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (S650) :. Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML (Z3580) :. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Helio X10) :. The current Antutu 6, doesn’t do the Liquid X2 any favors either. The Vibe K4 Note is slightly ahead, and you know where to find the Redmi Note 3’s. Then again, the Snapdragon 616 in the Oppo F1 puts it behind Acer’s phablet.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (S650) :. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Helio X10) :. The graphics department isn’t where you should expect the X2 to deliver record breaking numbers. Indeed, it doesn’t, but does a decent job with what it’s got. For example, in Basemark X it defeats the identically equipped Vibe K4 Note, and the Exynos 7580-powered Galaxy J7. The Snapdragon 615 and its Adreno 405 redeem themselves putting the Moto X Play and the Zenfone Selfie above the Liquid X2.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (S650) :. Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML (Z3580) :. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Helio X10) :. In the Manhattan bit of the GFXBench graphics benchmark the Acer Liquid X2 only manages 4.2fps in the offscreen 1080p part of the test. However, while it may be lacking in sheer graphics oomph, in practice the GPU needs to render less than half the pixels, hence the 9.1fps score in the onscreen test.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (S650) :. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Helio X10) :. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (S650) :. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Helio X10) :. Audio output not quite to audiophile standards. Acer Liquid X2 key test findings:. All-plastic build, simple but attractive design, metal-looking back holds firmly in place – tough to remove but it is mostly a good thing. Display has good contrast and maximum brightness and mostly accurate color rendering. Outdoor visibility is mediocre though, 720p resolution is only just enough on a 5.5-inch diagonal. Excellent battery life, with almost 13 hours in both on-screen disciplines. Voice call endurance is less impressive, and having three SIMs inside has a substantial effect on standby drain (duh!), but even then, the endurance rating is a good 65 hours. User interface is mostly stock Lollipop, but Acer has added a straightforward and useful multi-window feature, plus Float apps (Samsung and Sony, all in one). The modded notification pull-down is not the best, and folder icons go against function, but that’s livable. Benchmark performance is about average for the segment, CPU scores are ok and the GPU does a decent job, helped by the 720p resolution. The smartphone is pre-loaded with all sorts of bloatware, including a suite of Acer apps you can’t uninstall, plus a whole bunch of games you can get rid of. On the upside, there is a document editor on board and the camera app has genuinely neat features. The loudspeaker is rather quiet and gets a Below Average rating. Still image quality from the rear cam is barely there with soft output and low contrast. The front camera takes good images with true to life skin tones and good detail for a selfie cam, though processing seems pretty heavy-handed even with beautification features turned off. The front flash barely does anything in complete darkness. 1080p videos from the main camera are underwhelming, output is again, soft and low in detail.. The phonebook and dialer have a very stock Android look, only they’re a blend of Lollipop and Marshmallow. The latter lends the three-tabbed arrangement with favorites, log and contacts, but instead of icons the tabs get names like in Lollipop.. As part of the Float apps, the Liquid X2 has a Float caller toggle, which makes incoming calls appear in a small pop-up instead of full-screen. Smart dial is supported too, naturally.. The headline feature of the Liquid X2 is its triple-SIM support and it inevitably has a settings menu on how to handle them. You can assign a name to each card, as well as a color to identify it more easily. A preferred card must be selected for data, while calls and short message can be left on a case-by-case basis.. The loudspeaker of the Liquid X2 performed rather poorly in our test, falling in the Below average category. The Zenfone 2 ZE551ML isn’t better, but Moto X Play is a few notches up and so is the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3.. The Liquid X2 has a generic messaging app with threaded view of conversations. There are two email clients, the stock one and Gmail, guess which one is which in the screenshots below. You can’t remove either, mind you.. Short messages • Email • Gmail. Text input is handled by the Swype keyboard. It has word prediction, swipe input (imagine that), can be detached and moved around as well as squished to one side for easier one-handed access.. The Acer Liquid X2 comes with a standard-issue gallery, which offers three views based on albums, location or time. Three thumbs a row is the norm here and no pinch gestures can change that.. The editor, on the other hand, is a bit more powerful. It offers the obvious cropping, rotation and mirroring, color filters and picture frames, but also more serious editing like curves adjustment.. Technically, there’s no dedicated video player, videos are played from within the gallery, and play/pause is as far as features go. That said, the UC Browser comes pre-installed and it features its own video player, if you don’t have a favorite solution of your own.. Gallery video player • Third-party video player. For listening to music, the Liquid X2 relies on Google’s Play Music app, sporting the familiar Material design. It greets you with a “Listen now” screen which shows your recent activity. A swipe-in from the left opens up a menu where you can access your library, playlists, settings and the Instant mix feature. When fiddling with the phone, the app remains active in the background with controls, accessible from the notification shade. If you lock the phone altogether, a small control bar shows up on the lockscreen.. A very nice FM radio app is available on the Liquid X. It has RDS and can retrieve the stations’ names, but interestingly enough, only displays them when the current station is playing. If you want the names to appear in the list of stations, you need to input them manually. You can also record audio straight from the radio app.. The Acer Liquid X2 isn’t a particularly inspiring musician. When used with an active external amplifier its scores were as high as you’d expect for the most part, but the frequency response disappointed. Add the disappointing volume levels – this is one of the quietest phones we’ve seen and you get why we aren’t particularly enthusiastic.. Plugging in our standard headphones led to worsening of the signal-no-noise ratio, and increase in stereo crosstalk. Volume levels plummeted further down so don’t bother attaching very powerful headsets to this one. It’s one of the tests where the Liquid X2 budget nature really shined through.. Here go the results so you can do your comparisons.. The Acer Liquid has a 13MP camera on the back, which we’ll go ahead and keep calling primary, even though there’s the same setup on the display side of the phone.. Anyway, the rear camera can take images up to 4160 x 3120 pixels in resolution and the lens aperture is a respectable f/1.8. There’s no OIS, nor should you expect it, and there’s no fancy phase detection or laser autofocus. There is a tick in the LED flash checkbox, though.. The camera interface is a bit more cluttered than recent trends have been heading, but the extra buttons offer some genuinely useful functions. For example, the padlock button is a toggle that lets you save photos directly to a pass-protected Private album. You can also use voice control to activate the shutter with a preset phrase like “Cheese”. There’s also a zoom slider, and the pinch-to-zoom gesture doesn’t work.. ISO is buried in the settings menu, where you can also select resolution – a total of 18 possibilities there! Why you would insist on 4,096×3,072 instead of 4,160×3,120 is a question we can’t answer.. A truly convenient feature – Favorite Shot – lets you assign one of the capture modes to the third virtual button next to the shutter release and video record button, so you don’t need to switch modes just for that one HDR shot.. The arrow button in the top right pulls up a menu with shooting modes and some more controls. You don’t get a proper Pro/Manual mode, and some may find the logic of the grouping of the settings a bit odd. There are four white balance presets on top of Auto, there’s a delayed shutter release with 5/10/15s timer, and a slider for adjustment of brightness, contrast, saturation and sharpness. “Slider” may be an overstatement though – they all have just three positions.. You have Scene modes – landscape, night, night portrait and, well, regular portrait, and also a selection of color filter effects (just a few of those, not the kitchen sink). More importantly though, the Capture modes on top offer some interesting options, outside of the usual HDR and Panorama.. Presentation is one, and using that you can just point the phone at the screen and grab a shot of each slide, and it will correct for any skew your off-center position inevitably introduces. The process keeps the source images, so you can correct for any mistakes the software has made. You do need to explicitly save the finished presentation (as JPG or PDF file) – it took us a while to figure it out.. Multi-angle View lets you take stereoscopic images for side-by-side or anaglyph 3D viewing. Picture with sound lets you record a short message to go the photo you just took, but you couldn’t do that with a food shot – Gourmet is a capture mode all in itself.. The images that come out of the Acer Liquid X2 aren’t spectacular, but they aren’t bad either. There is an overall softness and low contrast to most images. Fine textures gets smeared, but straight lines are reasonably well defined. In terms of color rendition, the output is a touch on the warm side, and colors aren’t particularly saturated. The X2 is a little lacking in dynamic range, with highlights in bright daylight often clipped.. HDR mode applies a different tone curve, but in the X2’s case it acts in a rather specific way. It does salvage some of the otherwise blown highlights, but the shadows remain as dark as they would be in the non-HDR shot and the midtones get a boost.. An unpleasant aspect of the X2’s HDR mode is that it can’t handle moving objects, which turn into ghosts.. HDR mode: off • on • off • on. Don’t forget to check out how the Liquid X2 compares against other smartphones we’ve tested in our Photo compare tool.. Acer Liquid X2 in our photo compare tool. On the front you get another 13MP shooter, and even if promo material and the numbers would have us believe the two are identical, there’s at least some different processing going on here.. The output is good, don’t get us wrong, but it’s not on par with the rear camera in terms of detail. Even in normal mode (not Beautification) there’s some smearing in fine skin detail, though facial hair is rendered rather sharply.. Front camera samples: normal mode • beautification (sliders in the middle). The front-facing flash is borderline useless, you’re much better off sacrificing precision in framing and shooting with the rear one in complete darkness.. Front camera sample with flash • Rear camera with flash in the same conditions. The Acer Liquid X2 shoots videos up to 1080p/30fps. There are lower resolutions available, and a timelapse mode, but nothing fancier. Also, the video resolution setting lists two “HD 1080p” options, and we thought one might be 1080p@60fps. It isn’t, both capture 1080p/30fps, so go figure.. Videos are saved as 3GP files with a bit rate of just over 17Mbps, and audio is recorded in stereo at 128kbps. Video quality is uninspiring though, output is soft and with rather low level of resolved detail, and colors are somewhat washed out with low contrast. The focusing mechanism is not overeager and doesn’t hunt unnecessarily, so at least there’s that.. A unedited video straight out of the camera is available for download from out server (12s, 24MB).. Finally, you can head over to our Video compare tool, to see how the Liquid X2’s stacks up against the competition.. Acer Liquid X2 in our video compare tool. The Liquid X2 comes with four browsers pre-installed, because letting you download your own is too mainstream. You get a stock browser, Puffin, UC Browser, and Chrome.. Browsers: Stock • Puffin • UC • Chrome. The Liquid X2 comes with a pre-installed copy of Polaris Office 5, which handles document editing with ease. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs (both the 2003 and 2007 versions), it also opens PDF files and it doubles as a file explorer.. Polaris Office 5.0 can handle document editing on the move. The Acer Aid Kit includes System doctor, Power management and Backup and restore. The first one aims to clean up RAM and storage, while Power management keeps track of the apps and hardware that take a toll on your battery. It also gives access to a battery saver feature, which reduces brightness and performance and limits the use of non-essential radios.. There’s a simple file manager on board, but it does at least support batch actions.. Acer has thrown in a bundle of proprietary apps which can be accessed from the Acer Portal app, or from their separate icons. They require an Acer ID, and allow you to use your PC as a cloud storage solution for your smartphone. Naturally, additional software needs to be installed on the PC as well.. abFiles is yet another file manager (third so far), which adds your PC cloud to the local storage, but other than that offers largely the same functionality. abMusic is the music player of the bunch, with support for playlists and sorting by albums, artists or genres. You can guess then what abPhoto is for. Meanwhile, AcerEXTEND allows you to control your smartphone from your PC via USB or Wi-Fi connection.. The Liquid X2 sports a Quick Mode which is in turn divided into Standard, Easy, and Basic, with progressively simpler interface. Standard and Easy retain the two-tier interface, with a simple homescreen and an app drawer, while Basic only gets a homescreen and is more child-oriented. All three come with a redesigned notification shade and larger icons across the interface.. Although we genuinely try to stay open-minded, our approach to the Acer Liquid X2 wasn’t completely free of prejudice. We must admit though, it’s more than just a quirky triple-SIM smartphone – which is how it will most likely be perceived by most. We were there too, but we ended up with mostly positive impressions overall.. The plastic build is no flagship material, but it looks reasonably good. We appreciate all things removable and user-accessible, and this one can have its cover popped off and the battery swapped too.. One of its major flaws was already clear from the spec sheet but, for its low resolution, the display did well in all tests, save for sunlight legibility. Battery life is impressive too, especially so with heavy screen-on usage.. Lollipop has been mostly unchanged, but where Acer has added its own touches, they are a hit and miss. The good impression from the effortless multi-window implementation and useful camera features are spoiled by minor form-over-function decisions.. Camera output is barely average in quality with soft, low contrast images and videos. The 13MP selfie camera produces pleasing selfies but the front flash is hardly any good.. So, what else can you get in the Liquid X2’s price range? Well, actually, first things first. If you want an up-to-date smartphone with three SIM slots coming from a reputable brand, the short list is pretty short. Its sole entry is the one we’re reviewing right now. If you can settle for fewer SIMs, the selection quickly broadens. Where and if you can find the Liquid X2, it competes with midrangers in the $250-$300 ballpark and that’s a pretty densely populated segment.. For starters, you have Asus’ Zenfone Selfie that matches the Liquid X2 for camera resolution both front and rear. The Selfie has a dual-LED flash on either ends, if that can be a decider, but also has a sharper FullHD display. While it does have a base 2GB/16GB version, you could have it specced like the X2’s 3GB/32GB, so that can’t untie the knot either. The Liquid X2 lasts an hour longer in video playback and a whopping five more on the web on a single battery charge, but the Selfie can do 5h more in voice calls, so this may settle it.. If you’re not that much into selfies, but enjoy the Zenfone’s form-factor, you can always get a Zenfone 2. It is available in innumerable configurations, but we’d humbly suggest the FullHD ZE551ML in its top-specced Intel Z3580/4GB variant, even if that may cost you a little extra over the Liquid. A downside to this one is that you can’t easily swap batteries.. Asus Zenfone Selfie ZD551KL • Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML. The Lenovo Vibe K4 Note is another option you should check out. Same chipset, but a FullHD display, plus a fingerprint sensor on the back. While the K4 Note has solid battery life, the X2 outlasts it by more than 3 hours in both on-screen disciplines. The Acer phablet can’t match the K4 Note’s build quality though.. Then there’s the Samsung Galaxy J7. First and foremost, Samsung’s entry-level 5.5-inch phablet is a marathon runner in video playback with more than 16 hours on the clock before it runs out of juice. The Liquid does outlast it comfortably in web browsing though. The J7’s camera output is slightly better, but it does only have half the RAM and is outpaced by the X2 in benchmarks.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 can be had for significantly less, and in both versions it has more oomph than the Liquid X2. Metal build, FullHD screen resolution and fingerprint recognition are all in its favor. The X2 can offer somewhat better battery life and a removable battery, but this one is likely going to be settled by availability in your particular region. Yes, both devices are limited to specific regions.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 • Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (MediaTek). A dual-SIM version of the Motorola Moto X Play can be had on certain markets, and you should check it out. We’ve reviewed the single-SIM option, but the cameras are identical and much better than the Liquid X2’s, we must say. Moreover, the X2 loses its battery edge here, the Moto X Play is a pretty long-lasting smartphone.. Motorola Moto X Play Dual SIM • Motorola Moto X Play. You need not look any further if triple-SIM is a must-have. Now, that’s a pretty limited use case. Yet, the Acer Liquid X2 did make a strong case for itself as a dependable midranger. There may be better overall performers in that particular price bracket and better specialists at this or that. If you do your homework though and go for the Acer Liquid X2, it won’t let you down..

Trending iPhone X Nintendo Switch OnePlus 5T Tesla Model 3 Xbox One X. Acer Liquid X2 boasts a massive battery and 3 SIM card slots. by Jacob Kleinman | April 23, 2015. Acer is finally bringing a smartphone to the U.S., and the company’s first entry is a real doozy. The Liquid X2 boasts flagship specs and a few extra tricks for what is expected to be an extremely competitive price.. It comes equipped a 5.5-inch display, a massive 4000mAh battery, a 13-megapixel rear camera, a 64-bit octa-core processor and a trio of SIM card slots. That all adds up to a powerful phablet that should serve you well, especially if you’re on the road a lot and traveling between countries.. Acer says the Liquid X2 will arrive in Asia first, starting in August. The company told TechnoBuffalo it hopes to eventually get the price down below $200 off-contract, though it could cost a bit more at first. version won’t be quite as budget-friendly, and we still don’t know when the device will actually arrive in America.. The new phone also comes packed with plenty of Acer’s own software, designed to improve on Android and also interact with the rest of the company’s products. That includes a set of customizable digital switches, which show up through cutouts in the Liquid X2’s official cover case. You can use these switches to quickly turn on the camera, launch different apps or even play a small game without opening up the case.. Acer also took the opportunity to announce that its M220, which launched earlier this year, will be heading to the U.S. The Windows Phone 8.1 device should arrive in America by June, and Acer says it will get Windows 10 as soon as Microsoft releases the new software this summer. Take a peak at the Liquid X2 in the gallery above, and we’ve included a few images of the M220 to joggle your memory below..

Facebook Twitter Google+ Pocket WhatsApp. 13 MP front facing f/1.8 camera. The Acer Liquid X2 will be one of the best options for people in two niche markets. The phone is a pretty good overall device, but where it really shines is in battery life and the front-facing camera.. Interested? We are at Computex 2015 getting very close and personal with it, so let’s tell you more about it.. So as you can see we are lacking some specs. The main issue here is we don’t really know how much RAM and internal storage this device will come with. We know this phone is a mid-range device, though, and it should perform as such.. We can also see it has triple-SIM card support, whihc is another very unique factor in the equation. We have seen plenty of dual-SIM options, but so far this is the first device I have seen supporting three SIM cards.. And of course, this phone has an amazing battery life. A 4000 mAh battery is nothing to scoff at, and it’s something you won’t find even in the best of gadgets out there, even though larger batteries are what we have been begging for all along.. This happens to be a selfie beast, too. the Acer Liquid X2 comes packed with a 13 MP front-facing camera that sports an f/1.8 aperture. This is stunning, as even full-size camera lenses struggle to get such wide aperture. We can save the explanations for another day, but I can tell you this aperture will allow more light in, which means shutter speed can be faster and photos will be crisper, as well as less noisy.. We tested it for a bit and loved it. Photos are good, and the wider aperture also improves the bokeh (otherwise known as the cool blurry background effect).. It’s a pretty awesome phone, to be honest. We are not sure when it will be released or how much it will cost, but we know some of you will love it. You can be sure we will let you know more details as soon as we come across them.. 1 0 9 0. How to Play Travel Frog & Tips & Tricks. Altered Carbon’s Concept of AI is very Compelling.

Acer Liquid X2 review Source: GSM Arena Although we genuinely try to stay open-minded, our approach to the Acer Liquid X2 wasn't completely free of prejudice. We must admit though, it's more than just a quirky triple-SIM smartphone - which is how it will most likely be perceived by most. We were there too, but we ended up with mostly positive impressions overall. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 05/14/2016. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. While Acer still had the third largest global market share in the notebook segment in 2008, it ranked 6th in 2016 with a market share of 6% after they had continuously lost market shares.. There are dozens of Acer laptop reviews per month, the ratings are average (as of 2016). Gateway, which has an own laptop line-up, has also belonged to the Acer Group since 2007..
