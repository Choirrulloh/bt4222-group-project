alcatel,Fierce XL (Windows),";;;;;I've been using this phone for several weeks and it's holding up very good knowing it has such a small Snapdragon processor. Recently I updated to the Windows 10 Mobile Fall Creators Update, Build Version 1709; OS Build 10.0.15254.1. I'm using a  Samsung 128 GB sd card in it which makes the File Explorer load a little slow while strolling, but Groove Music along with the other media apps hold up suprisingly good! The screen feels a little sticky but has fairly good resolution. The camera resolution sucks along with it loading slow! But very nice phone otherwise!;;;;;Thanks for the reply! I never ran Windows Insider but thought I might with this phone, but now I guess I won't. You said you might get another phone?.........make sure you keep it Windows!!!:);;;;;Don't get to excited, if you are using the Windows Insider Program. My phone will only updates under Current branch. The fast or slow hasn't worked in four months. The overall phone is not bad, but I get the feeling that we will be buying another phone shortly.;;;;;I'm getting a  Alcatel Fierce XL in the next couple weeks for $40 off of ebay. Right now I have a Samsung Ativ S Neo (Windows Phone 8, updated to 8.1). The reason I'm getting this phone is because it is a Windows 10 Mobile. I would've liked to get a Microsoft Lumia 650 but the price was a little high. Anyway I was watching YouTube videos of the Fierce XL and it seemed everyone's biggest problem about Windows 10 Mobile is the app gap! Personally I don't think it's that bad with my 8.1, and my brother has a Microsoft Lumia 640 (Windows 10 Mobile) and he doesn't complain about it either!:) So if you're looking into buying a Windows Phone and the app gap is what 
you're worried about, go ahead and buy that Windows because 
you'll always be able to find an app somewhere in the Store 
that'll make up for the other app on iOS or Android!;;;;;quick reply,  which of the slots are for the simcard slot?;;;;;Next year when a 2 year old phone will be dropped from support from Microsoft ,you will stop being a Windows fan.;;;;;I had a Lumia 640 and switched to this phone. I am a Windows Phone Fan. However, after a period of 6 months, I am going back to my Lumia 640. Personally the phone and the Apps are made for Lumia aka Microsoft Products. In addition to this : I purchased my Lumia as a AT&T phone, XDA shows how to Flash the Rom to T mobile. Suddenly I had a phone that works as it should on T mobile, It is a long process but well worth it. So if your a windows phone fan : Get Lumia or Microsoft based phones.  The Apps DO NOT work correctly on other brands and limited. Even the Camera Apps both at 8 Mega pixel, the Lumia is Way above in quality and over all speed. I just wish I would have gotten a XL. However the 1520 for AT&T does not have LTE support for T mobile as the band is off and no wireless charging , NEW : you can turn on the T mobile Band for the Lumia 1520, Saving money to get me one!!! the super phone! No Phone to date has the specs of this phone!!! Check the Specs of the Lumia 1520, : Special info : there are 1520.1, 1520.2, 1520.3 versions. The .3 is for T Mobile. At&T Rom Version is 940 T mobile is 938. Have a Good Day Windows People!;;;;;Seems like a good and honest phone.;;;;;Dearest all.With this price tag and specifications,very good for children to know what Microsoft Windows 10 is!!!Why!!!?An average income person worldwide must sell their house to buy one of those Microsoft $3000+ tablets !!!So,Alcatel (of China now!) has done a good job!!A Windows smartphone under $ 80 much lesser selling someone,s house!!!So,tasting Windows is fun too,while android dominance is above 95%/ of all smartphone products!!!Amazing!No!!!?Omid12Omidvar,....;;;;;I kinda like this phone;;;;;I'm very happy with the Windows10 by T mobile along with Alcatel and I am so glad that they didn't do a big advertising campaign for the phone because that made it possible to send savings to the buyers Good Great Phone;;;;;I haven't found this set in stores in Europe yet, is it even available in Europe already? ;;;;;Where can I buy it in Europe;;;;;Does have FM Radio (Got mine through T-Mobile) Working well with 64 gb micro SD card Windows Groove music has no graphic eq or other preset sounds Does not have replaceable batter even thought the case separates for SIM card and SD insertion. Very happy with my new phone;;;;;release quickly it seems a great phone;;;;;Good phone, affordable, Windows 10;;;;;The Fierce XL comes in both variants, Android and now Windows 10. I don't think any Windows phone customers will pick up the Android by mistake.;;;;;and no android and ios game can match the age of empire castle siege on wp :P;;;;;$129.00 at Walmart.;;;;;Rightly said ;;;;;I wonder what the price will be;;;;;2GB Ram, better than lumia in mid-end. Microsoft do not have capabilities to build a good smartphone, bring back Nokia. ;;;;;most laggies phone os is wp10 wp8 was so better than wp10 and of course there's no games and no apps for wp like android and ios;;;;;its ok its still be great in a market whatever name they decide to make  the important is when it comes to users, if they like it , the phone suits them  if they not then no thats it  and its interesting but i wish it will be great on heavy games too;;;;;I have Lumia 520 with WP 8.1 Denim update and runs pretty well (except multitasking, that's the weak point of Windows Phones). I don't know much about W10m, but I think it would run on Snap 210 decent.;;;;;Agree, but I think they had better give it a completely  different name because the Alcatel Fierce is also an android phone, so Fierce XL sounds as a bigger Fierce. Better to differentiate completely. ;;;;;I think they should have called it something else other than fierce though considering the chipset...;;;;;Snapdragon 210 is crap, trust me! It is smooth, but for games it is going to struggle.;;;;;No problem for Windows to run smoothly on a snapdragon 210.;;;;;Snapdragon 210 ??;;;;;charging this bit of kit will take a while Evan if it last long.

alcatel,Pixi 4 (6) 3G,";;;;;ummm.. on my opinion this phone quite awesome .  actually I've bought this one a year ago and I used it for playing online gaming  it's good .. but, the thing is  I cant upgrade the Version of it.  THANK YOU for the service;;;;;Soooo....... umm........ Anybody gonna mention the fact the battery isn't removable or we just gonna ignore that fact....?  Yours Truly, The Observ@nt J@ck@$$;;;;;The only problem i have is the ram, 1gb, and the worst is it still has android 5.1;;;;;I have a lot of things to say about this phone. Let's start with arguably the most important part of a smartphone, the display: The display will never be considered by anyone as ""crisp"". 540x960 is a lackluster resolution, especially for a 6 inch screen. You can only play youtube videos in 480p at most. Alcatel should really have considered at least a 1280x720 resolution for a phone this big. Sound is also not in good condition. I'm not sure if only my phone has this problem or if all the models of this phone has it. Apparently the phone has 2 hidden sound modes, loud and soft. It switches between them at random moments. Theres nothing you can really do about it and can be really annoying if there are people nearby and you don't want them to know you have shit taste in music and watch chinese cartoons. This occurs with both speakers and earphones, just so you know. Build is also subpar at best. The weight is alright, not heavy at all. That also means that it feels cheap (not really a major concern to be honest). The texture of the touchscreen is bizarre. It's relatively rough for a phone. It feels like paper made for watercoloring when i put my finger on it. I needed to put a screen protector just to make it feel like glass (thankfully it comes with one... or at least mine did). I had a mindset for phones that bigger is better (to a point). And it seems like 6 inches is a little bit past my point. I have humongous hands, as in I have never met anyone who has bigger hands than mine. My hand fell a bit short in reaching the left side of the phone as it is wider than most phones. And if most of your pockets are small, this phone will bulge and stand out as if you have a rather large chocolate bar in your pants. But at least the display is big, if only it was better though. 
And now i have to talk about the ugh, camera. The autofocus in this thing is horrendous, it goes out of way to actually defocus the image. No one would ever believe that the photo you take with this phone is actually 1080p. I couldn't take a photo of my textbook 10 inches away from it for my classmate as the text blurred out and rendered unreadable. A 2 megapixel camera could produce way better photos in my opinion. The flash function is just plain broken. As the phone produces the flash, the photo was taken a few milliseconds late and the light from the flash would have already been gone. There are actually no difference in the image if flash was turned on or off.
 
The software is the only thing that's alright with this phone. Didn't expect much and what I got is alright, it did most of the tasks i did alright. But don't expect to play intensive games on this. There are some 3D games that run pretty good on this phone, but games like Injustice is just way out of its reach. The User Interface icons of this phone is ugly. They look like blurry candy. But at least you can download some themes from the playstore. The UI on the music player isn't to my fancy either so i downloaded a separate music player.
 
The connectivity of this phone is good though. I live in SE Asia, so it can vary if you live somewhere else.
 
I've had this phone for 7 months now. And it has survived a dozen drops and impacts. But unfortunately I think it has reached its limit. The bottom keys do not respond anymore and the phone is registering touches even when no one is touching it. the e, b, r letters on my keyboard doesn't work anymore (installing a different keyboard might fix it though).
 
Conclusion/TL;DR: 
Alcatel has made some great phones. But this is not even near that with all these cons and (hopefully just) broken hardware and no features, function, or specs that can make you choose this over alternatives at this price point or even cheaper. I suggest you take your money elsewhere and heavily consider a phone smaller (or slimmer) than this one as a phone this size can prove difficult and discomfortable.
 
Sorry if i made a ""review"" for an opinion section for a budget phone, but I really needed to express these thoughts and hopefully some people will find this helpful in making their decision.;;;;;This phone is cool, bat i have a problem always tearn off .

alcatel,Pixi 4 (6),";;;;;hello..how to enable icons 3G/4G on the status bar..thank you;;;;;Terrible  phone..unusable!;;;;;I have searched for an opinion board for this phone. I couldn't wait to say something. This is without a doubt the absolute worst phone I have ever had. Its slow, so damn slow. The apps, browser, hell everything freezes and doesn't work correctly. Its a cheap phone but its not worth a penny. If you have a choice between a dirty penny on the ground in an alley, or this phone. The penny would and should be your choice. Phones this poorly made should be against the law. Do not buy this phone please. I am tempted to collect names and numbers to file a class action lawsuit against this company and the worst phone in the history of humanity.;;;;;awesome phone in all never froze and nothing wrong with it only it doesn't have much for data space for apps.;;;;;Since the summer 2017 system upgrade, the phone often freezes, like perhaps once a day, It also has connectivity problems (I have to switch from 4G/3G to 3G/2G to reset, and back again). It also had bad battery and became slow until I loaded up an app to spin down background apps and unloaded facebook and facebook messenger. While the connectivity problems and freezing still happens, it's now fastish (though still requires rebooting now and then) and the battery lasts a good while. There was something pretty bad about that update.;;;;;This phone is as slow as a week in the jail and completely invisible to Windows. What you might call a ""stealth phone"", which would be great if you're looking for a communications device that no one else can detect and which will jealously refuse to share any media files contained within. In short, this is the single biggest pile of shite in both the history of piles - and of shite. ;;;;;Had this phone for 3 weeks. Worst phone I have ever owned. Keeps freezing. Takes forever to get into any apps if at all. Have to turn off phone tehn back on to receive texts sometimes. ABSOLUTE SH*T. ;;;;;Got this model 3 mths ago and since then dying to write about it.MY PIECE OF ADVICE .....""NEVER BUY THIS BRAND"".I have other brand before..Nokia,Sony.Samsung but this the worst..The sound quality is bad.it is not loud and even can decrease on its own.it can automatically off.sometime the keyboard ,you have to pressed it many times...it really make my blood rise..;;;;;The phone is shit,laggy af,freezes every 5 seconds,horrible blurry camera.Worst phone I ever owned by far,Alcatel=shit phones;;;;;yeees same thing is happening to me how can we resolve this;;;;;This phone is a piece if shit. After 1 month of owning it the soft keys (home, back, recent apps) quit working and the auto rotate quit working, says ""binary file error."" The 2 year warranty is a joke also, I contacted Alcatel who says they doesn't support this phone anymore. Shit shit shit. ;;;;;Hi! I have just looked off my phone last night and up till now when I am trying to turn it on only thing I saw is the Digicel ;;;;;I am facing this problem from 2nd week since I bought this phone RFC / rfc keys are not working when holding phone vertically while the are OK in horizontal position can anyone help me ;;;;;How do you stop AD's coming up all the time  ;;;;;Its frontal camera is not clear..not work and during video calling the other person on call even can't see your face due to low quality of camera  Frontal camera is really in low quality  Can anyone help me please ?&#128591;&#127995;&#128591;&#12­7995;;;;;;Have owned this phone for about 4 months.

Waste of money and is the worst phone I ever have owned. ;;;;;Help. How do you delete predictive text from this otherwise great phone, please?;;;;;Download a music app or purchase Poweramp, has equalizer. ;;;;;i also hav a problem with internal storage which i saw online as 16gb but its actually 8gb wit only 1gb remaining after d factory apps dat can't be uninstalled.... it's so frustrating plus even after u save sd as preferred storage, u still cant download new apps as u keep having d notification to delete some apps as memory is insufficient....;;;;;You are correct. I don't own this mobile but Alcatel phones are better then they used to be, in my opinion. ;;;;;Yes not the best phone ever built but it is impossible to get more phone for less. It streams videos, play games and music and makes phone calls. other people complain about the speed and memory both can be made better with a memory card. I used to have iphones on 2 year contracts but after them either getting dropped or the battery just dying completely after a year then paying through the nose to repair them I decided to go cheaper. The alcatel is £70 for a whole new phone you can't even repair any other phone for less than that.;;;;;If you do a system reset it may give you a little more storage space... ;;;;;It's cat it freezing all time and can't make calls or answer ;;;;;This phone is a piece of s***.  It has very little internal memory which is 95% taken up by all the obligatory Android apps that Google pushes onto it.  Then it has the worst possible obligatory app called ""Launcher"" which bombards you with ads for games and other useless programs.  Not enough?  It is very slow, sometimes just stops working.  A real nightmare.

I use my phone mainly for music and when I play it through my car stereo. The sound is very bad. Sometimes it's fine, but more often than not. The sounds terrible.

Once again, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, would not recommend. ;;;;;Hello Linda check your device well, you might be running an app which is not meant for the device or you are over working device. if your call is been dropped, please talk to your telecom network and maybe it could be that you activated an option in the phone which is causing that call drop. when you don't answer your calls it becomes missed call so why are you saying the misses calls. please check your device well, don't expect your phone to charge over an hour whiles you've used the phone to drain all the power. thank you;;;;;Are you sure battery is removeable.???......

Regret not returning within 14 days. I tried to sell it.  No takers. The cons are rapid battery drain, poor brightness (display) and occasional chaotic/confused UI performance. I tried everything to get this A-Pixi4 to function right, but unsuccessful.  Also: I own a LG Aristo, a LG Rebel..both are excellent phones that hold the battery charge well.  I use as a primary phone, a ZTE ZMax Pro that has a good battery.  I will keep the A-Pixi4  as a backup phone and charge it daily and get my money's worth over the next 12 months.

I brought this Pixi 4 phone two days ago from Wal-Mart, for $20.00 plus tax. It is not unlocked to other carriers. Just for Walmart family Mobile users. When I first got the plan, Walmart didn't have any cheaper alternative's that had Android OS,s. Now I'm glad they do. This phone was a major upgrade to what I had. And I am happy with my purchase. I would suggest that you get a 6gb sdcard or more to save apps because this version I have, only has 1gb internal storage, too save apps. Snapchat by itself takes up half that space. Maybe this phone cost more for people, that are buying it unlocked with more than 1 GB internal storage. But it works for me.

I'm very happy with this phone, the only bloatware it came with was whatsapp, no Tesco apps. I uninstalled this and some of the default Google apps that I don't use and was left with 11GB free space. The 6"" screen is great, the cameras are the 'same' as every other phone -- get a proper camera if you want pro quality pics. Performance is fine; I don't play games, every other type of app I've used is fast and responsive. I get strong reception in remote areas where other handsets get none. It has a cool multi-tasking feature where you can display multiple apps at the same time on the screen. No complaints whatsoever. £8.50 per month (24mnth contract) which is reduced to £5.50 per month if you install the Tesco Mobile Xtras app -- total bargain.;;;;;This unit keep on restarting by itself.

alcatel,Pixi 4 (4),";;;;;The phone is rubbish apps and games keep not responding all the time ;;;;;Or disable in Settings- Apps;;;;;SLOWER/ WORSE SPEC than the PIXI 3.   BEWARE of you buy from Car phone warehouse, that's the low memory version (Mike reports only 2GB internal) Terrible battery life, about a day after 3 months use (used to be 3 with background data disabled) And the hands free speaker is very distorted.  I'm not usually opinionated in reviews, but, really? Car phone warehouse should drop this;;;;;Just go into settings - more- ( 3 dots menu) doable background data.;;;;;Worst phone manufacturer ;;;;;I put an SD card in my phone of 32Gb and stav is right, it is running 8 x faster. But now I cant see anything on the screen because its running so quickly and I cant type fast enough.  I have had to throw it all away because the battery only lasted 3 minutes when it was running so fast and it got hot.;;;;;I found joy launcher to have a lot of issues it kept coming up joy launcher not working  so I downloaded google launcher & installed that & the phone runs a lot more smoother & NO stupid octopus appearing on the screen ;;;;;My advice is when you get the phone straight away download google launcher from the play store & install that ! As the phone comes with joy launcher which has issues it slows the phone down keeps coming up joy launcher not working ! After downloading google launcher the phone runs a lot smoother with NO issues !!! Its a basic little cheap phone which will do as a spare don't expect too much from it ;;;;;I bought this handset as I needed a cheap phone after a week of using it the screen went black & the phone was unresponsive & a box kept coming up saying joy launcher not working ! After removing rebooting the phone it kept happening so after doing a bit of research I was told to download google launcher from the play store which I did & I changed the launcer;;;;;I have never been a fan of anything google and this phone has confirmed my opinion on it. When the phone is not installing some app I neither selected or even want it is updating all the other apps it has installed against my will. No matter what settings you choose and set it will continue to do this anyway.  Most annoying it is so busy doing its own thing I do not think I will ever get chance to use it as a phone when I need to as it is locked in its own functions too much. What a waste of money they say its a smart phone but its not smart if you cannot make calls because the phone is too busy to let you into it.;;;;;I bought a Pixi after my flip phone that I had owned for about 6 years died. I was genuinely surprised at how cheap it was, only $100 CAD. It is a good device for calling, texting and web surfing. The only real complaints I have is that it has small storage, ram and a slowish processor, so games are not something this phone does well. It loads all webapps fine, it can play 480p video no problem and doesn't seem to care when the video is higher resolution, it just scales down. Honestly if you want a powerful, high tech phone this one is not for you, but if you want a cheap, functional smartphone I recommend it. 7/10;;;;;Got two, unfortunately :( The first got stuck in a loop loading Android and only a factory reset would get it working again, clearing all data on it and the sd card as it was formatted as internal memory. The second had to be replaced as the display became corrupted in the first five minutes of use. Worse was to follow with Alcatel updating the default launcher with ""Joy Launcher - live wallpaper"", which removes useful features of the factory launcher, and substitutes them for an extremely annoying smiling mutant Octopus spider thing that hangs from a thread  from the top of the home screen (no I'm not kidding), plus according to google play and several reviewers now contains advertising, but I removed it and disabled updates before seeing any ads myself because it was so infuriating. the new launcher seems to be aimed at, and possibly even written by two to five year old kids.;;;;;it has to be the biggest load of rubbish I have spent 5 visits to o2 i 2 days and the blurtooth still does not work Buy at your peril;;;;;It looks like there are two memory options. 4GB, giga byts, of storage with 512MB, mega byts, of working RAM, random access memory. Or 8GB, giga byts, of storage with 1GB, giga byts, of RAM. If you think of storage as a book case where your books are stored. The bigger the storage, the books you can keep. RAM is like the table where you read you boos at. The more RAM you have the more books you can have open on the table at the any one time. The processor speed is in GHz, giga herts (billions of times per second). This determines how quickly things can be done.;;;;;It doesn't claim to have 4GB of RAM. RAM stands for Random Access Memory which is basically the speed of the operating system. 512mb is pretty slow by todays standards. 4GB is the size of the internal storage (including Android and pre-installed apps). Unless it has the capability to use USB storage there won't be a lot of room to store new apps. The 4GB storage version has 512mb RAM The 8GB storage version has 1GB RAM;;;;;it has 4gb, just 2gb is used up by android. RIP;;;;;512Mb of RAM wow! Not many Apps can be installed with that so why try to make out it's got 4Mb?;;;;;Built-in storage is 2GB, not 4GB. Too little for all todays apps.;;;;;i buy it in indonesia the 8GB version, it works well. the only problem is the TFT screen is ugly in vertical angle 4/10;;;;;Buy a new one, they're cheap.;;;;;I've resently flashed my pixie to the original firmware. And now it is showing only 512 kb of ram instead of 1 gig like its suppose to, anyone has any idea why;;;;;Google voice would be my suggestion. I've seen others talk about APN settings being the root of this problem.;;;;;It developed charging problems after 4 months and stopped working in the  fifth month. Very bad expedience!!;;;;;Hi, everyone, I have the Alcatel 4034x too. But find. Two major problems. I can,t receive or send text messages. Keep getting message, messaging has stopped unexpectedly. ? Driving me mad. No idea why this us happening. Can anyone help. Please &#128548;;;;;;I've got the 2MB version which is, occasionally, irritating; the 4MB would've been better. But.... for 25 quid it's a useful piece of kit, and one which I'm not going to shed any tears over if I crash and b####r it up (as my previous phone!).;;;;;Got the one with 3mp camera, 512mb ram and 2gb memory. I love it for the most part, it' pretty fast and everything works like a charm, perfect phone for someone who doesn't need much. I have only one problem, not sure if it's faulty with my only or generally with this model. The 3g signal is very often dropping to no bars at all, even tho for the most part it is decent. It's not too much of a problem, because it still has enough signal for people to call me and if it doesn't have good enough signal for quality call, it switches to 2g which is always full. It's just bothering me, even tho it doesn't give me any problems...;;;;;as a sales person, never recommend this phone. everytime sold this phone people come back to returned or some issues;;;;;Both of it's cameras are pretty decent in normal light conditions, you can take a good picture or shoot a good video on a cloudy day. I love front flash. CONS: It only has 2 GB of internal storage, and its system apps waste about 1.6 GB. Just crazy. Of course, you can fix it a little by disabling some apps. And something really important: There are two apps (weirdly, they're system apps), Facebook App Manager and Facebook blah blah, I don't remember and you just CAN'T uninstall them. They're really suspicious, so just clear their data every once in a while and it'll be fine. And about the storage problem&#8203;, even if you disable apps, because of Android marshmallow, you can't move apps to your SD card. Other than that, it's really good and I definitely suggest you to buy it.;;;;;Don't get this. It's ok for a backup phone. Recommend getting cm13 on this, alcatels os is ugly the 8gb version might be ok, but 4gb is very bad, always running out of space, and i cant make the sd card work;;;;;Worst phone ever . not better than pixy 3 why no flash on camera and why are there some batteries not charging  waste of a $100.00  upgraded phone?  My ass;;;;;Oh no I have just been and bought it out of car phone werehouse , done it on a big bundle , but I think they have given me the wrong sim to put in , going back today for some help.  I bought the pixi one touch 3 5 inch I love it , its a bit slow , but just want a basic phone with a little front camera , not really a phone person ;;;;;If you are thinking of getting this phone, I would definitely recommend spending a bit more on the 8gb model, as even if you are not much of an app user or have an sd card your internal will soon fill up with texts and photos and videos on he 4gb model and it will get tiresome deleting these things, I know as I have the phone myself.;;;;;It might be a bit late to respond to your post but I have found a few phones that meet your criteria. The best one is probably the plum gator 6, but that doesn't have lte if you want it, and the design might not be to your taste. It does have a good main camera and battery though, which does make it better than the others, arguably. One with a sleeker design and lte connectivity is the micromax vdeo 1. It has a worse main camera than the aforementioned phone at 5mp, the other one having an 8mp main camera. It does have a better selfie camera though at 2mp, the other being 1.3. The last phone is the unnecto Quattro V, which is really the worst of both worlds, so I would recommend you choose one of the first 2. Anyway, I hope I was helpful, if a bit long-winded.;;;;;Nope, just the Swiss way to tell someone to use his brain.;;;;;Good manners! Is this a British Etiquette?;;;;;Smartass. Someone from the UK isn't going to fly to Romania just for a mobile.;;;;;Anyone plz tell me where can I found pixi 4 (4) model 4034E or 4034F having 5+2mp camera and 1 gb ram for using in India/bangladesh??;;;;;You realise that this is actually a feature of the phone that you can disable under settings?;;;;;The phone has an automatic timer that turns it self on or off at a specific time when u set it to.check for that..;;;;;What a piece of crap. After the phone has been turned off it turns itself back on after a few hours. It will be going back for an LG.;;;;;Am i able to download pictures or videos sent to me by friends to my computer please?;;;;;I'm just curious does it work only on EE or is it unlocked ;;;;;Just ordered one of these.

But I think it says it upscales it to 3 mp!...is that right??;;;;;I'm not quite sure what you are answering in the affirmative to. Are you saying that the 8GB model is AVAILABLE? If so, where? ;;;;;yes one version with 8gb storage/1gb ram/5mp camera, and other with 4gb storage/512 ram/2mp camera;;;;;I note that availability how now changed to Available - Released However, the 8Gb memory model (4034F) is still apparently unavailable, the 4Gb model has been available some months now.;;;;;it means he has 2 cameras, one in front 2p, and secound 5p;;;;;Camera - 2 Mp or 5 Mp.....what does this mean?  Are there 2 versions?;;;;; i have purchased the but not using .unable to operate please give manual for use;;;;;Where I can buy the one with better spec (1GB RAM and 8GB ROM)?;;;;;I don't understand. Over here, where I live (Europe), there's already a Pixi 4 on sale. 4 inch screen, 70 euro. However, only the lower spec version (4 GB, 512 MB). Is there a better version to be released, or what?

ZTE,Blade Z Max,";;;;;I have owned this phone for not even a month. In this small time of ownership of it I can say this. Do not by I was tricked into it cause it was free. Now let's get to the pros and cons of this large piece of shit. Pors: long battery life. Large screen. Dual camera. Great sound quality. Finger print scanner. Cons: Small memory. Ram 1.8gb. CAN ONLY RUN ONE APP AT A TIME, feels very cheap, uses all of your ram for battery life, hardware is garbage, software is garbage, no stock browser, no stock keyboard, Google is mandatory browser, MMS and text work sometime. And it uses 1.8 of 1.8gb to run your phone. Oh let me not forget the crashes. As I see it this phone should've never been released. Maybe the worse phone ever released in the new tech era. Epic faceplam is needed here.  Overall: Do not buy it even for your cat. It's a very poorly made phone. 2.3 out of 10.0  Yes it's that bad. I am going to contact zte and see what the tech department is going todo to fix this. If nothing I will be filing a class action lawsuit against them for misleading performance spec and knowingly disturbing a faulty product to the American people. ZTE has been fined by the government once already for selling technology to North Korea. ;;;;;I upgraded from the ZTE zmax pro too the new blade which has one processor. The zmax pro has 2 and a wider screen. Yeah it's an older version phone then the new blade zmax but will run circles around it. I do a lot of things on my phone and between the two. I must say the zmax pro is better as far as multitasking. The new blade zmax is a overall quality piece of shit. Sold it first day I got it freezing up and stuff. I have to give them a bad review if they made the new blade like the zmax pro. I'd gave them a thumbs up.;;;;;The phone is OK, not the best. I used to have an LG G Stylo 1st gen which I bought Feb 2016 and it's been working great, just figured to get a newer phone and got this about a month ago. Anyway, back to the ZTE Blade. First of all, it doesn't have as many customizable user changes I had on the LG. Secondly, and this is my biggest complaint, is when I first got the phone, I wasn't receiving any calls. I'm on family mobile network (T-Mobile). I can make calls, but every once in a while, I couldn't receive calls. I looked up other forums and some people have said to turn off the ""voice over LTE preferred"" which I did, and it worked for a while and then it started happening again. I've noticed that I couldn't receive calls when I was on a WiFi network. Family mobile doesn't have wifi calling feature, and looked into the WiFi calling feature. It was set on WiFi preferred. I changed it to cellular network preferred and so far, it seems to work better than before. Every once in a while, I can't receive calls so what I do early in the morning I do a couple of test calls and use my wife's phone to call my phone to see if it's working. I know it's annoying, but I try to remember to do this every morning. It does seem to help though. I try to do test calls a couple of times a day to make sure I can receive calls. I think maybe around Sept or so, I might trade up to another LG phone, I've had several since and they seem to work really well for me and are more user customizable. So, if I were to give this phone a star rating, I would give it 2 1/2 stars out of 4. ZTE needs to step up their game on their phone line if they want to stay in the US market and increase their sales here. ;;;;;Send picture then reset the phone anytime you want to send another one have to wipe cache every time reliad the.phone thenwirst piece of shit;;;;;I hate this phone and everything about it! this phone should not be sold! they should scrap it and throw it away!;;;;;I hate this phone! the graphics are bad, the text messaging app is bad...

They offered me a refund of the phone if it has less then 1 hour talk time. Well, I talked to a rep for over an hour, so no return. AND, the phone is locked for 90 days. So I can't use the phone on another carrier. I am talking to a lawyer about a lawsuit for deceptive practices.  We shall see how far metro PC is willing to go just to let a paying customer change carriers, after one week..;;;;;The phone works great. Data does NOT work except in major cities. I drove from Elgin Illinois to Omaha Nebraska today. 450 miles, west on i-80. I lost data in Clinton Illinois, about 30 miles from Elgin. Never got data until Des Moines Iowa ( four hours later );;;;;Bought it today 3-6-18 Lost my LG Tribute HD. So far, WOW!! Videos like movies/YouTube,  outstanding. Camera seems OK. ( I use a DSLR for my camera). Text wouldn't send pics , something about to large of a file. Went to play store and got the Android messenger, works perfect.  Fingerprint stuff works good. Online data, is Great, way faster than my old phone. Been surfing heavily for around 6 hours and still 60% battery life left. And I never charged it when I got home. Annoying metro p, logo on upper left screen. 
So far so good. 
I'll update this post every couple months. 
Got the phone from metro PCs, never tried this company before. 
 this phone was $120.00. 
They took off $100.00 
Because I switched from boost. 
So, for $20 for the phone,  plus monthly plan, $60.00 
What's to complain about? 
All in all I am happy, we shall give it awhile and see how the phone and Carrier work out.



;;;;;I had 3 ZTE BLADE Z MAX and they have been wonderful very fast no issues at all with me so far never had any problems with nothing I even have the ZTE MAX from Boostmobile and theay great phones batterie last almost day and half everything work fantastic. Don't why this people are having problems with them I love the ZTE ;;;;;I've had this phone for about 4 months now and I can not count how many times this phone has freezed on me. I try to open just one app at a time, app freezes, device freezes, wallpaper changes to default and I have to try the process over again. I previously had the Zmax Pro for over a year and I ran into none of these issues. (I only upgraded due to a charger port complication.) This phone was seemingly advertised and brought to me as a well designed phone but the weak components of the phone make it almost unviable for use. I'm usually not one to complain but seriously you would be better off buying a phone such as the Stylo 3 or the J7 instead if this device. The camera takes 3-5 seconds just to register one picture and might crash. App like Snapchat and Instagram have a higher chance of crashing on you. The memory on the phone is so terrible. 3/10. Don't Buy.;;;;;I'm a zte fan but this blade sux. the first phone i bough on christmas lost the charge over the weekend and would never power back on even when charging. I returned it and received another brand new phone. It's now march 1st and the screen has completely gone zombie black on me with flashing colors resembling a rainbow. I never had this issue with the previous zte's. Very very very disappointed;;;;;i bought this phone about 5 months ago. this phone is garbage. it freezes 5 times a week. runs very slow. i have had to do factory reset 4 times. and the wallpaper changes to original default. i am not buying the zte company phone again. i am going back to lg company phones. please do not buy the zte company phone. this phone is very bad. ;;;;;Why so money people are complaining about this phone I just can't believe my phone has been working perfectly better then the Galaxy 800 plus dollars that I used to have ;;;;;The good: long battery and 32 GB.

I do agree that the phone can tend to be a bit laggy. The Bluetooth on mine cuts in and out sometimes, but is fixable. I'll say this, I had every Zmax since the first one. When these phones first come out, they are buggy and a little off centered, but after a few months, ZTE usually sends a software update to address the glitches. I am hopeful they will send one for this model, I have yet to see one, but am hopeful. I do think these are better than some of the new LG's that hit the market. Bottom line, it's a budget full HD smartphone. Expect to see glitches here and there...my phone hasn't really done anything to seriously annoy me, but I do understand the comments too. Write to ZTE with your concerns, if enough people write, ZTE will be forced to update the software. However so far so good! No major issues, except for Bluetooth, the best fix for laggy OS, whatever, power cycle, power cycle, power cycle!!!;;;;;I would like to so far should I purchase this the ZTE Blade Z Max???;;;;;this phone should be recalled and refunds given to everyone and they should be fined;;;;;i hate this phone. read my above comment.. these never should have been released and should be recalled and refunds given!! crazy that they get away with this;;;;;do not, i repeat, do not purchase this phone!! i have owned zte zmax....so i figured id upgrade to this one....its oike throwing $130.00 out yhe window. the phone overheats while charging (i haven't even owned it 2 months) processor lags keyboard lags. videos and audio are the worst this phone never should have been released and shoukd be recalled. 
i wrote bbb, and got an automated redundant response about manufacturer warranty blah blah blah
 
#1 i dont want another zte 
#2 the store wants to charge $15 to exchange and send off, even though its under warranty.
 
no, im not throwing another $15 to replace a phone with same piece of garbage thats going to give me the same problems
 
ridiculous;;;;;You think Android sucks because of your experience with cheap Chinese phones? If you can afford to switch to an iPhone then buy the Samsung Note 8 instead to make a fair comparison and intelligent decision. I really don't understand people like you. ;;;;;Yes I agree umm I bought my phone a month ago and it work great no problems I come out the hospital yesterday and it completely took a shit the screen shut off it won't turn back on I've tried restarting it I've tried charging it so that's that;;;;;Thanks for your comment. I'm a zte user, have been for years. They are really great phones for the price. Going to purchase the blade today. &#128077;&#128077;;;;;;Not a fan of this phone!! I hate it! Can't receive messages. Gives you notifications when IT wants to. It lags, freezes, and stops constantly. Also the screen is not easy to swipe on. You have to continue swiping until it feels like working. I hated the other version too. It was cheap and since I dropped my other phone I had to get this. It's not fast at all. Only pro is the split screen feature and even THAT is restricted. I feel like I wasted money. I'm slowly about to convert to Apple. These Android's absolutely suck!;;;;;my instagram is acid drips if you have questions. but i will explain the pros and cons i have about this phone... first of all, people seem to get nonfunctional phones sometimes but i did not. the bad things about the phone is it does lag depending on what you do, like having 15 apps open or just one. when i try to record a song off my other phone to instagram. this phone messes up the audio really bad. honestly i cant think of anything bad right now but for the most point the phone is good. but the ram might be a problem if your trying to play the most top end 3d games... battery life is the best out of anyphone ive had and it charges very fast... of yeah, i did have a problem wheere the volume would rise but that coulda been my earbuds cause they broke the same day but its fine now;;;;;lmfao maybe lock your screen mister;;;;;youre talking about the blade x max not the z max.;;;;;this phone is awesome so much better then the zmax pro in every way a great upgrade;;;;;This phone absolutely sucks. Before I purchased The blade, I had the ZTE pro max.6.0.0 The phone  Performed great. Unfortunately I dropped it and the screen shattered. Luckily, I had afew bucks to spend on the newer version of the ZTE series. Thinking that the new blade would out performe My previous phone, I bought the blade nougat 7.1.1. keep in mind my old phone was 6.0 marshmallow. Obviously, I was under the impression the more advanced the phone the better the performance. Boy was I ever wrong. The phone lags, buffers like mad, and quite frankly sucks. Wish I had bought my old model instead. Don't waste your money.;;;;;I hate this phone I too loved zmax But after this phone, I'll NEVER BUY ANOTHER bought an SD card and can't even move stuff over to it Slow processor Terrible quality phone and video I'm done!! I threw 180 away;;;;;The phone is good on heavy usage the battery life is phenomenal nice crisp display I haven't encountered heating up after streaming videos  although the phone is huge with a 6 inch display the thin build of the phone makes it easy to hold all in all pretty solid device good job ZTE keel it up the &#129302;;;;;;So I wish I bought the Samsung J7 Prime instead.  This phone gets 4/10.  Maybe a 6/10 on a good day.  My biggest pet peeve... I like to settle down in bed looking at Facebook.  I look at it in landscape mode or where my hands hold the phone at the bottom and top so I look at the phone sideways (horizontal).  When I click on a photo or news story, the phone is forced into portrait mode (vertical) or I have to turn it long ways up and down.  After I leave the photo or news site the phone remains in portrait and does not go back to the original landscape setting.  Without purchasing an app, is there a way to fix this?;;;;;not work gprs 2g network;;;;;I have had the ZTE Blade Zmax for around a week now. I really like the phone! I've had every zmax version since original launch and i can honestly say, their great devices. I first had the original zmax, owned for 3 years, the zmax pro, owned for 1 1/2 years, and now the Blade zmax. Let me just say, for what you're getting for the price point, you can't really beat it. 6.0 inch FHD display, 16mp by 2mp rear camera, 8mp FRONT camera, 4080mAh battery that works well and lasts long, plus quick charge 2.0+android nougat, and not to mention the storage (32GB internal). Its a good phone! Yes the device may not be the fastest and smoothest OS wise, but depending on how you use it, will dictate how it will serve you. As far as concerns for the device read on other posts, i haven't noticed any issues. Battery performs well for the whole day, sometimes 2 depending on your usage. The only time i noticed the phone to heat up is when you play a game, which i find to be pretty standard and normal. Camera is exceptional and has cool dual effects, and a nice bright led light. The phone can tend to get laggy once in a while, a simple power off for 2 minutes and back on will perk it right up, plus this should be done at least once a day for any phone to ensure connectivity. I have yet to find any major issues with this device, i think for $99 at metro PCS is a great deal for this device. For those who have used ZTE in the past, you should have no issues using this device. I recommend it to anyone, its the budget friendly all-in-one device that serves needs at every level...Recommend definitely!  ;;;;;Very true, only at Metro PCS.   Go with the ZTE Pro anyway,  it's a great phone, also has a big battery that will get you through the day,  the glass is more scratch and shatter proof and can still buy it at Metro PC's ;;;;;I agree, this is the worst ZTE I've owned.. I love ZTE due to the large screens, but this Blade Z Max is a killer. It gets stuck often and can not be shut down due to slow processing and the fingerprint button overheating the phone and no battery access to help cool it down. Im a Cricket user (yes Cricket does have this phone) and was given this as a upgrade 3 months ago due to my last zte discontinuing. I will be changing soon....;;;;;Your talking about the wrong phone they only have it at metropcs;;;;;Ported my number from AT&T to Metro and got the zMAXblade (free)had it for about a month give it 8 out of 10 no complaints love the big screen and the resolution I'm a data person don't make a lot of calls this phone works perfect for me;;;;;Get a Google Chromecast. It will tie your TV into the Smart Phone (and other computer devices in your house).;;;;;  Before I owned this phone I had a ZTE zmax pro .  I had that phone for over a year and I accidentally dropped it.  So I decided to buy the same kind of phone.  The first three months was just what I expected and about 6 months in my battery started going bad.  By the 7th month I needed a new phone and I was kind of confused of what I should do.  Only because the first one was good and the 2nd one wasn't nothing like my first one.   The day I went into my story they had a new type of phone and in my price range.  I went with the ZTE Blade Z Max.  I've had it for only a week but for now I am completely satisfied with my decision.  I'm hoping I made the right decision..(only cause my son and I have a bet) he says his iPhone will last longer than mine..lol;;;;;I got one also. How do you hook it up to your TV?;;;;;I got this phone from Metro PCS store, 100$ + Tax... 32 GB internal memory is pretty enough. Screen is Full HD and 4000 mAh battery is very nice... Screen coat is very slippery, feels good while using in games or surfing on WEB... Pictures are not colorfully, like I phone 7 or 8, so its just 100 bucks phone...  In my opinion best phone in this price range, 100 dollars is nothing for this fast, reliable and tough phone... Charging is really fast, I like it...;;;;;This is the Worst phone I have ever owned. It shuts down, kicks me out of apps and worse after owning it for 4 months ( note past the 90 warranty)  the screen started separating fromn the phone. ( No I didn't drop it) It is crap! Do not own a ZTE.. worse I am upset at Cricket for telling me it was such a great deal.. I miss my LG.. and will be going back soon. I will NEVER own one again and will encourage others to not own one  It should be called the ZTE Blade POS;;;;;It's definitely Japanese glass, not Chinese;;;;;Yeah does that to mine too I don't know why;;;;;Best phone i've ever received (free) for switching carriers. No problems with phone.;;;;;I'm very very disappointed n the zte blade phone..I've had it a lil over a week n cannot get my widgets the pull up...I went to send pics with my messages no place for attachments or to add a file..I play rpg games alot n it gets really hot while playing them..M y heart is really broke over this phone.. I had a boost zte max plus n was best phone ever..so with that I figured the next phone they came out with would be at least as good..I would not recommend this phone to anyone...;;;;;The phone itself being used for one single task isn't bad at all. ANY and I mean ANY multitasking kills the phone due to idle RAM at 1.7 of 1.9 available. Facebook messenger cannot be used. It will force close without giving you an error. Also screen sensitivity is very low due to the Chinese glass.;;;;;My boyfriend and I have been five year customers of straight talk and paid the $45 plan for each phone. The phones were cheap and limited.   We went to MetroPCS and bought two ZTE Max Blade phones and bundled them onto an unlimited everything plan and only pay $80. And I also pic the due date of my bill.   After 3 months I'm still loving it! I use it for everything! I hooked it up to my TV and watch videos from it, I also teather it and we run our laptop's all day!     The cameras are so clear and the sound quality is perfect.    I love mine so much I bought one for my daughter and put hers on my plan which made it $10. Cheaper!  Now I pay $70. For 3 phones all unlimited everything and never lost signal.  The screen is alot bigger and takes some getting used to and it's hard to find holders for car use ohh and the charging port is a different size from my old phone. But it charges fast and lasts so much longer than my old phone. I put a 32 SD card in it and store videos and pics like crazy with no problems.    I love my phone and think it will las me for a long time without needing to upgrade.   ;;;;;Have had it lest than a month. Sometimes it recognizes my memory card, sometimes it dosen't.  Having repeated issues with Camera, Play Store, Music Folder, File Manager, plus various other apps not opening/working at all.  Just get black screen and eventually after about 5 minutes or so will get the message that that specific app has stopped working.  Restarting the phone does not solve the problem nor does shutting down the individual apps. Would be a good phone if it actually worked consistently. I've been staring at a black screen again now for the past 5 minutes where it should be running my camera. ;;;;;Just got this phone on the MetroPCS Unlimited Data Plan and it's the best phone I've ever purchased at a $100 price point, it's great. The performance, battery, camera (even in low light) are all great.. only real limitation is the 2GB of ram, but that's not bad either. It's one of the cheapest phones with Gyro (for 360 video and Phone VR), Good GPS.. and it has excellent build quality. I would recommend. One correction to the moderator however: the phone does have an FM Radio built-in and comes with a radio app... I disabled all networks (Cellular & WiFi) and it works great on the phone. Just food for thought GSMArena and I would put in an update or recommendation but I don't know how. To all those not on MetroPCS, it be a great time to get 4 lines at unlimited data rates for $100 a month ($25 per line) and with their current special get up-to 4 free phones (I'd recommend this one, it's the best one they carry). It's not a plug, just a crazy good deal.. and they will also unlock a phone for any other service after 3 months.. Thanks;;;;;Having problems !!! I canÂt download apps even video camera work !!! Can someone help? W this ? ;;;;;To use it properly with Straight Talk you'd need to have it unlocked and then buy a Straight Talk SIM that uses the T-Mobile network. ;;;;;I LOVE IT>>> My husband bought me one as well for himself and ive had it for a day now and  have no issues. its all in how you use it if you start down loading bunch of crap of course the cell or any cell will have less memory or if you don't delete texts or calls , refresh your cell once in awhile take CARE OF IT LIKE YOU WOULD A CAR but I am loving it  why spend godly amounts of cash for an iPhone or galaxy unless your rich but I am content   thanks for reading ;;;;;Got my grandaughter one two months ago the turn on button wood not work so it useless not happy about it at all ;;;;;I put my memory card in it had to be formatted to be used as extra internal storage which wasn't an issue I had nothing on the card anyways ..i have been able to set some of my apps to my card.. Hope that helps.. ;;;;;Yes most phones you can use a memory card as your internal memory as long as the apps you download are transferrable. Some apps can not be transferred;;;;;Yes it is fast charge 2.0 and it does stand it's ground. Very decent phone for the price;;;;;Good phone. I had mine for 2 weeks now. It does everything I need it to do and more. snappy speed. Streams videos flawlessly. Excellent battery life. I have had no issues with apps closing. The only thing I can knock it for is the low load speaker on the back but I use a bluetooth speaker most time anyway. Totally worth the price! ;;;;;Very rarely, like once or twice a week, an app may close by itself. IMHO totally acceptable for the price and considering the hardware; this is not a flagship but aspires to be a substitute in many areas.;;;;;does anyone have any issues with this phone?  some people have issues with frozen screens and apps force closing on there own. ;;;;;Have had this phone for a month now. Excellent battery life and quick charge (better than other QC2 phones I've had in the past), good screen quality, mediocre camera (especially in less than perfect lighting), terribly weak loudspeaker in the back (almost unusable outdoors), low Ram(closes most apps instantly when app switching, especially annoying with chrome and Maps) but I can live with it;;;;;Can you use this phone with straight talk?;;;;;I absolutely LOVE this ZTE phone. It's big, it's powerful, fast charging and slow draining. I can use my phone ALL day and still have 30% left. The camera is what sold me. I can take photography grade pics with this amazing phone. It's definitely a great phone that's a budget buy . ;;;;;i bought my ZTE Blade Z Max almost a month ago. I am very please with it. For the price you can't beat it. Wondering if you put a 32 Gig. memory card in it. Can it be used as an internal card and can you transfer apps on the memory card. Love the phone.;;;;;It says quick charge 2.0;;;;;The phone doesn't drain fast at all;;;;;Yes it has fast charging. I just bought one for my son a few days ago and I have to say IÂm fully impressed with this phone. He loves it. Great phone especially for the price ;;;;;i bought the new ZTE Blade Max on metro pcs less than 7 days ago , i very surprise of so fast the battery drain in 4 / 6 h if you heavy used  even if you call the battery drain ,  the volume of phone  is very low i need set at max volume for  watch movie or took with some one  the only positive  thing is the HD big screen  and  take only 2h full charge the battery  , but i can't charge at battery twice at day  i use it for work and personal  i will suggest to purchase at different brand  like samsung  , lg , nokia  , iphone   all phone except the ZTE . ;;;;;It's ;;;;;Does anyone know if this is a fast charging phone ?;;;;;Fabulous replacement for note 4.  What phones are lighter, have a bigger battery, or bigger screen?  Bright and colorful-$40 vs $840?   Apple guys always us the same adjectives, amazing and incredible.  But this phone REALLY is!;;;;;this mobile available in pak?;;;;;Can y'all make one for Verizon Wireless?;;;;;I bought one on Tuesday the 29th of August at a local MetroPCS store. I like it very much. 4080 mAH battery, has a microSD card slot, USB-C FAST 9V CHARGING, beautiful display, fingerprint reader, WiFi calling (HD calls), Android 7.1.1  almost pure Google Android experience,  virtually ZERO bloatware on this MetroPCS handset.  2 Gig of 4G LTE data and unlimited calling / SMS for $30 a month, no hidden fees or taxes, no contracts. What's not to like?;;;;;No. One SIM slot only.;;;;;One more benefit the Blade has over the Pro is that the Blade has Android 7.1.1 N  where the Pro is still on Android version 6.;;;;;I think an octacore processor is good the 435 is better than the 617 because its 8  cores at 1.4 ghz where the 617 has 4 1.5 and 4 1.2 so 435 sc wins;;;;;Oh, also the dual cameras on the back are a step forward.;;;;;Yes, an octa core processor is the best but they went a step backwards with this phone. It has a slightly slower processor. The only improvements are a bigger battery and quick charge 2.0. Other than that it's a cheaper version of the Zmax Pro (spec wise).;;;;;Anyone know when this is actually getting released?;;;;;An Octa-core is the best processor.;;;;;No. Operators in USA hate dual sims.;;;;;Is this phone with dual sim?;;;;;Why not a better prossecr;;;;;Nice cheap dual cam phone with bokeh effect feature.","[datetime.date(2018, 3, 21), datetime.date(2018, 3, 19), datetime.date(2018, 3, 18), datetime.date(2018, 3, 17), datetime.date(2018, 3, 16), datetime.date(2018, 3, 16), datetime.date(2018, 3, 14), datetime.date(2018, 3, 12), datetime.date(2018, 3, 10), datetime.date(2018, 3, 6), datetime.date(2018, 3, 6), datetime.date(2018, 3, 3), datetime.date(2018, 3, 1), datetime.date(2018, 3, 1), datetime.date(2018, 2, 25), datetime.date(2018, 2, 19), datetime.date(2018, 2, 19), datetime.date(2018, 2, 16), datetime.date(2018, 2, 13), datetime.date(2018, 2, 13), datetime.date(2018, 2, 13), datetime.date(2018, 2, 13), datetime.date(2018, 2, 12), datetime.date(2018, 2, 9), datetime.date(2018, 2, 9), datetime.date(2018, 2, 9), datetime.date(2018, 2, 5), datetime.date(2018, 2, 4), datetime.date(2018, 2, 2), datetime.date(2018, 2, 1), datetime.date(2018, 2, 1), datetime.date(2018, 1, 31), datetime.date(2018, 1, 31), datetime.date(2018, 1, 28), datetime.date(2018, 1, 25), datetime.date(2018, 1, 18), datetime.date(2018, 1, 17), datetime.date(2018, 1, 6), datetime.date(2018, 1, 5), datetime.date(2018, 1, 3), datetime.date(2017, 12, 29), datetime.date(2017, 12, 27), datetime.date(2017, 12, 23), datetime.date(2017, 12, 22), datetime.date(2017, 12, 13), datetime.date(2017, 12, 11), datetime.date(2017, 12, 10), datetime.date(2017, 12, 9), datetime.date(2017, 12, 7), datetime.date(2017, 12, 3), datetime.date(2017, 12, 1), datetime.date(2017, 11, 30), datetime.date(2017, 11, 27), datetime.date(2017, 11, 26), datetime.date(2017, 11, 24), datetime.date(2017, 11, 19), datetime.date(2017, 11, 15), datetime.date(2017, 11, 10), datetime.date(2017, 11, 9), datetime.date(2017, 11, 6), datetime.date(2017, 11, 5), datetime.date(2017, 11, 1), datetime.date(2017, 10, 31), datetime.date(2017, 10, 29), datetime.date(2017, 10, 20), datetime.date(2017, 10, 16), datetime.date(2017, 10, 11), datetime.date(2017, 10, 10), datetime.date(2017, 10, 9), datetime.date(2017, 10, 5), datetime.date(2017, 10, 3), datetime.date(2017, 10, 2), datetime.date(2017, 10, 1), datetime.date(2017, 9, 30), datetime.date(2017, 9, 28), datetime.date(2017, 9, 27), datetime.date(2017, 9, 26), datetime.date(2017, 9, 25), datetime.date(2017, 9, 24), datetime.date(2017, 9, 13), datetime.date(2017, 9, 4), datetime.date(2017, 9, 4), datetime.date(2017, 9, 4), datetime.date(2017, 9, 4), datetime.date(2017, 9, 2), datetime.date(2017, 9, 2), datetime.date(2017, 8, 27), datetime.date(2017, 8, 25), datetime.date(2017, 8, 23), datetime.date(2017, 8, 23), datetime.date(2017, 8, 23), datetime.date(2017, 8, 22)]"

Check official website before you post dummy.;;;;;It's not bad at all. It's actually very good for the price.;;;;;Not OTA update or not even OTA menu option?;;;;;I think the reason it's being discounted is that there isn't going to be an update to Nougat or Oreo, it's stuck on Android 6.0. There are a few problems with it as I mentioned in my review but can't complain too much at the price. It also doesn't have NFC which is being dropped in many Chinese phones but still quite useful in Europe.;;;;;i want to buy the m2  due to its amoled screen 4gb+64gb  and great price. BUT im been hearing pleanty of software and hardware problems for this phone here in Greece. thus the sudden price drop to around 120 euros. Can anyone share any malfunction problems? thanks;;;;;Also there is an update on the Nubia India site but it is still Android 6 and version 4.0 of the Nubia software and I can't see any difference so probably not worth updating. ;;;;;OK I've worked this out now, the ""home"" button doesn't illuminate on this phone, the ""breath light"", actually lights, are the lights for the ""back"" button and ""open windows"" buttons either side of the ""home"" button and it is these that work as the notification lights, but they have to be activated for each app in ""notifications"".  Took some working out but there is no manual, not even online.;;;;;Also bad, but I don't know if this is a fault or not, the red light on the start button is not coming on for notifications. You can set the breath lights to light up when you have a notification instead but then they seem to take a while to stop lighting up after you've read the notifications. Obviously some downsides with Chinese software.;;;;;Review time: Good: Slim, good battery life, excellent OLED screen, excellent amount of storage. Bad: Poor camera, poor speaker, not very loud even on maximum, poor call quality. So both a step up and step down from my previous phone, there's probably better chinese budget phones.;;;;;I think you have to get the Z17 Lite to get Android 7.1.;;;;;Ui 5.0 and its android 6.0.1.;;;;;Chinese only;;;;;hello there, it is applicable to global ROM or this is just for Chinese ROM?;;;;;So the Chinese nougat from doesn't have English language? The M2 needs Nougat/5.0 badddd;;;;;How about this one's camera quality.;;;;;Its ZTE update politics. You will not get updates on this phone unless you learn chinese and port the chinese rom your self.;;;;;It is a beta for chinese version of the m2. I guess chinese ppl will be very happy.;;;;;Got this one from Geekbuying, global version. No OTA updat;;;;;has 4g+??;;;;;there is a update for it. the latest version is on the Chinese website. ;;;;;Born with android 6 and will get burried with android 6. There will be never an update for android 7.1;;;;;now 130Â;;;;;Do you know the sar value of this phone ? European price  Thanks for your answer;;;;;You know if it goes update?? Thanks ;;;;;Good phone n good price. But iÂm not the fan of gold, so i donÂt buy it;;;;;it supports volte or not;;;;;Good phone for the price and has one of the best designs I've seen so far, i bought the black with gold version, with the gold line going all around the phone's side, gives it a luxurious and stylish look, using the phone for more than a month and no problems so far,  just waiting for Android nougat.;;;;;where can i get it in south Africa ;;;;;were can I get this phone @ south Africa ;;;;;Black and Gold looks elite.

ZTE,nubia Z17,";;;;;Will this get Oreo?;;;;;according to this:   ..it supports volte;;;;;It doesn't support volte;;;;;Zte nubia z17  launch date in INDIA ;;;;;Very nice phone.

It's very nice using nubia. When will it be available in india??? When it is available, can i exchange nubia z17 with nubia z11 + additional cash?? If not, please can you make it happen??;;;;;Yes. IP67.;;;;;Not AMOLED, but they use the 3 subpixel for every pixel tech. At the end the black level is good.;;;;;Yes, but with lower performance in low light situations. ;;;;;The OP5 and Z17 camera are just ok, same level of quality. You can check using the compare of gsmarena. Honest enough for a hi-end phone but not at top 5. ;;;;;You will not find the traditional LED multicolor dot on top of screen for notifications. The home button works as a LED notification when the phone is locked, but only with the standard red color. Works for any notification and to inform of battery fully charged. ;;;;;You have to root and use Mokee firmware with OpenGapps or any other firmware with OpenGapps. I tried to root and install OpenGapps with stock firmware (Chinese and international) with no success. With Mokee+OpenGapps you will only loose edge gestures and Nubia camera software, replaced for the Pixel camera software, but you will win battery life, more software updates, all translations and the clean Google layout.;;;;;no OIS.;;;;;IP67;;;;;I tryed the chinese and international firmware. Trash and trash. If you want this model you will need to use Mokee firmware.;;;;;The software is a pure trash. Bad translations, notifications with text out of the box (layout design problems) and to finish no Google Play native support. I was saved by an alt ROM from Mokee team. Now he is clean, with the standard Google design, super fast, good in battery performance (after the first week of learning, I have now from 1.5 to 2 days) and very stable.;;;;;when will these phones are available in pakistan any idea;;;;;The Nubia phone development team has excellent designers and engineers. But this team has a huge problem. The producer thinks the buyers are idiots. Therefore, the manufacturer cannot hire two developers to update the firmware. As a result, my phone z11, which was recently the flagship, still works on Android 6.0. Although Google has already released Android 8.0. Don't expect to get this firmware on z17. I'll remind you that the new firmwares is an opportunity to close the vulnerability. But the producer seems to think that their customers are willing to tolerate vulnerabilities and hacker attacks. For example, with the recent vulnerability in the WPA2 Protocol, which especially affected devices on Anroid 6.0. Is it possible with this approach to recommend the use of the Nubia phones for business? I doubt very much. It's a shame.;;;;;How was the software for this device? I know the hardware is almost unbeatable if you compare to other phone. How the Android OS for this device if you upgrade the OS? Will it have bugged like most china phone? ;;;;;It does not support Band 28 (700 MHz) unfortunately.;;;;;I wonder why, why Nubia you remove sd card and 3.5 mm jack? If this is an upgrade to z11 which i have...you should not remove the basic of the phones!!! Why did't you use the same high sim slot???;;;;;No 3.5 jack No radio rds No sd card slot (my Z7max dual sim + dedicated micro sd) No 2560x1440p (2014 Z7 had it!) So it is using the same screen as my Z7max from 2014 and have none of the above this is a no go. People get things for granted, unless they drop the phone's price to half they're not going to sell as many.;;;;;I made a purchase of the waterproof model and would like to know if it is IP67 or IP68. I do not find on the manufacturer's website the specifications of the Z17 waterproof. I had a Sony Z2 waterproof and liked it so much because I walked in with it in the pool, out in the sea and never happened problem.;;;;;Best Snapdragon 835 device , camera superb , only we need international firmware ,;;;;;Does the Nubia Z17 have an OIS / EIS camera?;;;;;Its not all about the RAM. No phone still doesnt even utilize 4GB, so calm down;;;;;No;;;;;Not overpriced but, that price you said is only for 6GB of RAM. 629.99 is for 8GB RAM.

Hello, can any one please let me know the launch date in India.;;;;;Lol do u know that current high end flagships do not have FM Radio because they disabled the feature? And u call that overpriced junk? Lol dude. I have Sony Samsung XIAOMI and HUAWEI smartphones. Z series and X series from Sony, S and Note series from Samsung, all high end flagships from XIAOMI including MI MIX and finally the current HUAWEI P10 and HUAWEI HONOR 9 flagships. Ok, lets go to the ""overpriced"" topic. Look at the Sony and Samsung smartphones especially. They cost around 700 euro. Bruh the specs are a bit off especially the RAM and this give u 8GB of RAM with high end specs. U should appreciate man, if u don't have to money like me u can at least get this smartphone right?. Dude...;;;;;Oneplus 5 has very high sar values, I was thinking buy a op5 but now I am searching zte's values;;;;;One plus 5 has a better camera but it is more expensive, the only downside of one plus 5 is that it's an iPhone clone. ;;;;;3.5 mm jack Memory card slot Decent camera Decent screen resolution  Excellent battery life  These are the three things 80% of the market expects. Why u keep putting crappy features to sacrifice essential parts?;;;;;Low light photos are better than samsung. Design is not simple with colours.(look like cheap one);;;;;No memory card slot, no FM radio, no 3.5 mm jack. Overpriced junk made with cost saving in mind. Disappointed. ;;;;;which is better nubia z17 or oneplus 5 and what is the camera specs of this mobile ?;;;;;No MicroSD slot, no FM Radio (as always :( ) no 3.5mm jack and bluetooth 4.1 looks a little bit outdated but the rest looks great! ;;;;;Yes , the one with 23 MP is for daylight photos ( for great detail ) and the 12 MP one is for indoor and low light photos .;;;;;Last year Z11 is much better than this one with its card slot and 3.5mm.;;;;;Primary	Dual 12 MP, f/1.8 + 23 MP, f/2.0, The phone have dual primary camera.;;;;;The secondary camera has more pixels than the principal?;;;;;this phone from ZTE like its Axion model was designed for one reason and one reason only, to be the BEST audio device ever, the S8 may have the higher audio resolution but this phone will trounce the s8 in the antutu benchmark as its ppl resolution is just above the 400 threshold flagship territory meaning it has more CPU power generally but it's audio is where it will shine depending on the headphones used ;;;;;ZTE is always bad at these.....their company is already going down. A life and death of a company, lol;;;;;No 3.5mm headphone jack? No party... What a ""smart"" decision to sacrifice the 3.5mm jack port for cheaper waterproofing. I wanted to buy this phone. Happily i read all the description. Good luck ZTE, you're on the best way to lose your customers.;;;;;AFAIK you can still have 24-bit/192kHz audio (analog) carried over USB Type-C using the Audio Adapter Accessory Mode as long as the phone itself supports it. ;;;;;no ois? no party..;;;;;+1 Some endurance rating information would be great about these phones :);;;;;ips screens are 1990's tech...;;;;;why no radio???;;;;;Please share a review for z17 and oppo r11 &#10084;;;;;;Review please! ;;;;;Waiting for GSMArena excellent review .;;;;;I believe band 12 and 17 are interoperable on AT&T: .  ;;;;;It would run T Mobile but AT&T relies on band 17 with 2, 4, 5 from my understanding. So I think it wouldn't fully operate on AT&T. TMobile (MetroPCS as well) run on 2, 5, 12.   ;;;;;I heard that last year camera was good. Will this one be better? ;;;;;Please review this phone;;;;;I have one opinion for ZTE's NUBIA lineup. Can they not put the red accents in a smartphone cos it looks like MSI's previous few lineup of motherboards like Z170A and before? Because its just like JayzTwoCents complaining about that ""godly"" red accents on the MSI GAMING X GTX1080Ti lmao;;;;;Yes it is kind of overkill for smartphones because there are only a few smartphones with 8GB RAM currently. But, I suggest they should also focus on the camera more by improving noise in each photo and better in low light rather than focusing putting a high end chipset and putting 8GB of RAM in a phone;;;;;Will this phone work in America? On AT&T?;;;;;Is that phoe is water proof? When its come online marketing in india?;;;;;8 Gb ram is kinda pointless on a phone.I know more is better but 4-6 gb ram seems appropriate.It's better for a company to focus on camera,connections and quick charge rather than more ram and high specs on paper only.;;;;;This is one of the marketing strategies China branded phones use, high specs at affordable price. By the way, if QHD doesn't make 8GB RAM sweat, I believe at FHD the phone shall fly . Shouldn't that be a good news? Furthermore, if the phone doesn't standout from its specs, why bother buying it?;;;;;This is one of the marketing strategies China branded phones use, high specs at affordable price. By the way, if QHD doesn't make 8GB RAM sweat, I believe at FHD the phone shall fly . Shouldn't that be a good news? Furthermore, if the phone doesn't standout from its specs, why bother buying it?;;;;;Since I am on a roll, and I want to pose this question to the ""group"": to prospective buyers of the ZTE Nubia Z17: will you be getting this model with 6 GB of ram or 8?;;;;; I guess I'm on a role. I have been writing about this unit a bit as of late.  EDITOR CORRECTION: previously, I asked whether or not Sony would stop shipping models minus color issues, however I should have typed ""models without color inaccuracies"".;;;;; The more I think and comment about this unit the more tempted I am to get one. Regardless, I'm even more interested in waiting until next years crop of Oreo 8.0 units rear their heads. Will Sony finally stop shipping models  color inaccuracies? Will HTC add a 3.5 mm jack for it's top model next year? Will Samsung greater compete with Qualcomm and other companies in terms of models shipped with their own chipsets? Will Dolby Atmos on handsets become standardized? Will so called midrange model's grain greater market share? Will Qualcomm develop a Snapdragon 846 chipset? ;;;;; I also think the red metallic color is the best option for this unit.;;;;;Ram wise, companies are going to keep adding higher ram options, likely, indefinitely. ZTE doesn't sell as many phones as Apple and Samsung, so I'm hardly surprised that they now offer a model that has more ram then those two, let alone any other manufacturer. Can you say bragging rights? ;;;;; I recently read about this model on the official Qualcomm website. In essence, they were vocal about this unit being their first offering to feature quick charge 4.0 plus.;;;;; I predict that eventually, all units sold globally will have 4K oled displays (or better) with high refresh rates. ;;;;; I'm glad I came to the opinion section for this unit. Often times, people boast about why their favorite brands are king, and, dismiss other brands, hardly making the case for either for either brand. Today however, you guys are asking questions about this Nubia model, and debating it's finer points. Cheers guys.;;;;;All feature's are high but battery(3000mAh) & resolution is not high that is low with another features ratio;;;;;This is one of the marketing strategies China branded phones use, high specs at affordable price.

When can we expect the review for this phone?;;;;;8GB ram is a total overkill...;;;;;Nubiya z17  red fhon is the best;;;;;True, but then why bother with 8GB of Ram? Specs do not make sense. ;;;;;Will this be available in the USA?;;;;;QHD is not always a mandatory option. You gotta understand between the benefits and disadvantages QHD brought to the device, it will somehow burden the processor affecting performances. Hence, 1080p is still the best resolution to be optimized.;;;;;Of course! Looks like you are not an all-time nubia user. It has always been a notification breathing light since nubia phones started.;;;;;That red circle around the home button...would that be a notification LED by any chance?;;;;;No quad hd ? Then no to this phone.;;;;;How i can get this phone*;;;;;I have been using iPhone &#128241; 7 plus 128 GB variant. But I am still android fan specially Samsung &#128242;! As I used to use a8 older version, It was fully satisfied but I lost it and compelled me Buying another so!  But I think I could have another android phone which could be this one or honor 8 plus or mi6! Any suggestions or I could for nite 7R, One+ 5 or Samsung 7edge !;;;;;Awesome specs but I'll probably wait for the axon 8, I'm a sucker for front facing stereo  speakers ;;;;;when your grammar improves :);;;;;That isn't a 3.5 jack... it's a IR blaster;;;;;Good Idea.;;;;;Interesting point. I prefer more than one speaker... however, I own a single firing handset that is louder and fuller than many dual firing models. I'd like to see websites (e.g. GSM Arena) properly compare handset speakers in ways similar to how they compare built-in cameras. It'll be interesting to hear the ZTE Nubia Z17. 8 GB ram is welcomed. The more the merrier I say.;;;;;How will i got this Phone ;;;;;I realy Need this Phone ;;;;;Awesome specs but I'll probably wait for the axon 8, I'm a sucker for front facing stereo  speakers ;;;;;always endup  seing zte's in web do they exist in real world;;;;;WAIT WAIT WAIT wait..hold up..SD835 but Bluetooth 4.1  that makes no sense since the SD835 comes with bluetooth 4.1 and nothing else;;;;;umm no..not even close but ok..amoled and super amoled are two completely different things the only similarity is that they both gave the same colours..but on super amoled the colous are more pale though;;;;;no 3.5mm jack,What!!!???Is this so thin that it cannot be housed or just another copy-cut from other company removing it?If you say its soooo thin that it cannot be housed,then its a big lie because my z11 is thinner than this yet it has a 3.5mm jack....useless idea at all!!!;;;;;I will crush my piggy bank if this phone have a water resistance so that even if I walking through the rain I can still play hahahahah;;;;;it will work anywhere as long as this phone is unlock.. ;;;;;Wow, bravo, good work ZTE. Now make Axon 8 with same features and front facing stereo speakers.;;;;;Can anyone show a picture displaying the SDcard slot?  There is so much confusion spreading around with false specs!;;;;;No headphone jack? Is this a joke?;;;;;omg, really ;;;;;Super amoled is just how samsung named amoled, same with 1+ optical amoled;;;;;Is how the the ZTE Nubia Z17 Mini got a headphone jack, but the original version dont..hopefully there is a ZTE Nubia Z17 Max with a Headphone jack and at least 3750 maH..at least..and amoled display..not no super amoled display..yes super amoled saves power but Amoled looks wayy better ;;;;;Anyone know if this phone will work in Canada? ;;;;;Battery capacity should be more than 4500 mah;;;;;Bluetooth 4.1, no jack ,  no micro sd...  No wonder it is cheap. A joke;;;;;According to you high quality audio is gimmick. A technology to make your battery have 100 more cycles and protection against fast charging effects are gimmick. Waterproofing to prevent accidents is gimmick. LDAC to keep audio quality while using wireless phone is gimmick. It is funny to see that some people know even deep codes of android, but just care about CPU, GPU and price.  I believe a PS4, DSLR and feature phone is a better choice to you buddy. ;;;;;There is a SD card slot actually, up to 200GB;;;;;its ip man lol! :d;;;;;man look at the last picture her , is not on the bottom of the phone , is on the top , it  looks like the 3.5 jack . ;;;;;No headphone jack, No SD Card, No way.;;;;;It would have been perfect with a jack and sd card slot. This phone should have an expandable memory slot..GRRRRRR ;;;;;Nice try comparing it with a 3 /4 year old model. Heck it doesnt have Jack and SD Card.;;;;;Half of the thing u said the nubia doesn't have, have.  Second i had an xperia z2 with all the x reality display etc, that's a gimmick, all you need to do is to wait for the reviews, don't come upfront and decide the phone is less good than ur dying 1000£ xz premium.. ;;;;;How 'bout XZ Premium?;;;;;ZTE also doesn't have 2000mg of sarcasm.;;;;;IP is Ingress Protection, not International Protection.. ;;;;;Cool.. Did not know this ZTE has:  4K HDR screen, X Reality, Triluminous, Hi Res Audio, LDAC, 960fps HD videos, IP65/68, Battery care, Qnovo Adaptive Charging,  5 axis EIS, Hybrid Predective Autofocus, Front Stereo Speakers.. Nice ZTE offers all this for much less than 400 dollars Thanks for letting me know.. ;;;;;IP68 is 1 min 30 seconds under water (1.5 m) while IP67 means you can have it under water for 1 min 30 seconds under 1 meter only.;;;;;Well, you are probably right. People who loves the average specs (including camera and performance) will probably go for this phone. But those people who think that it's value for money might buy Sony XZs (which has better optimization in performance and better camera with slowmotion);;;;;The adapter would have to have an appropriate DAC to support 24-bit/192kHz out.  That's why the claim of the phone having that audio, without a 3.5mm jack (a DAC built in), is bogus.  The phone would have to rely on an adapter to supply the audio out or the headphones (in the case of USB headphones).  Then by proxy it would also rely on the file's sample rate...as some DACs will upscale to their respective output, and others, won't. However in some pics it looks like it has a 3.5mm jack;;;;;At least its much better than stupid Sony XZ for 750 eur.  This cost 500 and offers same specs apart from some sony crap developed by mad guys with depleted brain from sony. ;;;;;The second digit provides certification for water resistance. A 7 rating ensures Âingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1m of submersion)Â according to the IEC. While a 7 rating guarantees protection for up to 30 minutes, 8 means it can be underwater for 30 minutes at depths of up to 1.5m.;;;;;What about global market?;;;;;Wow, Just wow. I was so amaze with that phone. But the battery :(;;;;;OMGGGG look amazing god job ZTE;;;;;ip68 is more resistant to water and its around 1.5m deep for 30min;;;;;Ip67 : until 1 meter 30 minutes under water Ip68 : until 2 meter 30 minutes under water;;;;;IP Â This stands for the International Protection marking, a standard drawn up by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). 6 Â The first digit stands for its resistance to dust, but also general dirt and sand. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S8 earned a Â6Â rating for ÂNo ingress of dust; complete protection against contact (dust tight)Â following an 8-hour test. The iPhone 7 has the same rating for dust resistance. 7 Â The second digit provides certification for water resistance. For our purposes, this is the important bit. A 7 rating ensures Âingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1m of submersion)Â according to the IEC. While a 7 rating guarantees protection for up to 30 minutes. The Samsung Galaxy S8 received an 8 certification for water resistance, meaning it can be underwater for 30 minutes at depths of up to 1.5m.;;;;;WOW;;;;;is there anyone kind enough to explain to me the difference between ip67 n ip68 ? thanks;;;;;Samsung S8 and Iphone 7 plus killer.;;;;;Its still same 200 mAh difference is nothing maybe a hour or two extra;;;;;No headphone jack... Bye bye....;;;;;Thanks;;;;;Simple answer, U can get the analog line via adaptor, and the 24bits will do the jobs.;;;;;Was going to pre order but no 3.5mm jack is a no go for me. I hope ZTE rethinks this. ;;;;;Camera no OIS?;;;;;What makes it bad? Its got a great hardware and nice design;;;;;It's having quick charge 4+;;;;;just another bad phone without audio jack;;;;;this is my the phone ive been waiting all this while;;;;;No 3.5 mm jack. Man, it seems this is the new trend! The problem with this phone is, that they NOT include any earphones out of the box, such as HTC did with the U11. So you surely need the adaptor.;;;;;Wait... they say it has a 24-bit/192kHz audio but there is no headphone jack. What!?!;;;;;It doesn't matter without headphone cause Bluetooth work on it...;;;;;Quick charge 4.0 is well slow. Dash charge by Oneplus still tops speed :) . Definitely interested in the battery life of this . If its good it may be a worthy purchase . ;;;;;You are so right. If a phone doesn't have the following features I'm simply not interested, no matter what are the rest of the specs or the design.  - SD card slot  - Waterproofing  - 3.5mm jack;;;;;urggh..no headphone jack..srsly..lets hope the external speakers are loud enough..phone so perfect then they gotta kill me with no headphone jack;;;;;No matter what people still sh!t over any new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack;;;;;What about OIS?? Or this has EIS as the Pixel? Does somebody have the correct information regarding this thing?;;;;;Guys i dont know how BUT SD 835 IS LESS POWER HUNGRY THAN 821 i think couse 10nm but battery will lasts at least like S8 U11 etc ... alongside that this design is best seen so far with great camera combo i hope i will be able to get this phone from china and price tag about 500e looks so cheap for this specs and design .... you still complain rly?;;;;;looks interesting but for 8GB of ram only 3200mAh. how about trying 4000mAh :) but over all base on the comment on this phone looks like this phone looks great ..as for now.;;;;;Samsung S8+ with SD835 also clocks the same as Z17.  4×2.35 & 4×1.9...any comments?;;;;;3200mAh it seems ! ;;;;;A powerful Snapdragon 835 but higher cores clocked at 2.35ghz same as Snapdragon 821? Really?;;;;;3200 ma;;;;;anyone knows if ZTE nubia being released on ASIAN MARKET??? SEA specifically????;;;;;here is how a 3.5 port relates to ust port on other phone:  the 3.5 is much bigger than usb. So it is impossible the z17 picture to show 3.5 port. It is a IR port and the smaller one is the noise cancel mic.;;;;;it's the IR port.;;;;;i see it on the picture uploaded by gsmarena.. there is hole like 3.5mm audio port. Just check it;;;;;It has CDMA and some of the USA bands, here you are from the spec above: LTE band 1(2100), 3(1800), 4(1700/2100), 5(850), 7(2600), 8(900), 12(700), 20(800), 34(2000), 38(2600), 39(1900), 40(2300), 41(2500);;;;;no 3.5;;;;;qualcomm confirm this Nubia Z17 the first phone with new Quick Charge 4.0++ ;;;;;can  anyone please confirm 3.5mm jack is available or went for vacation..?;;;;;tons of bloatware..non amoled..non USA carrier..fail;;;;;Love this phone but 1080p screen will surely make other people change their minds about considering other phones;;;;;Is this going to get US GSM LTE bands? ;;;;;secondary camera 16mp!! that's  interesting..;;;;;Will these be usable in the US?  I can't seem to find which bands it has.  ;;;;;OIS and Bluetooth v5.0 ! Overall good job ZTE;;;;;Good job to ZTE (nubia) for this Z17. And hopefully it will include an SD card slot, although if you take the 128GB variant with the 6GB or 8GB RAM, it will be quite fine, in a way at least.;;;;;Faster launch than nokia 9... ;;;;;No CDMA like the Axon 7?  SMH.  That's one of the awesome things about the Axon 7 - it functions beautifully on Verizon's network in the U.S.  ;;;;;The design is killer. It will be my next phone if it comes with OLED display and IP 68 rating for water and dust resistant, ;;;;;yes;;;;;They lack front facing speakers. ;;;;;Why don't you like the nubia series?;;;;;Dear ZTE we don't want a new Nubia device, just give us the new Axon device called Axon 8 with the same specs as this Nubia Z17 along with those powerful stereo speakers that we love on Axon 7.;;;;;how much is the price ZTE nubia Z17;;;;;is it currved screen?;;;;;Not bad, not bad.;;;;;When it will release? ;;;;;Looks great apart from battery which looks ugly. 3000mAh accumulator in this beast is crap.  Its like ferrari with motor from fiat or opel.  Really bad.  ;;;;;Still! Radio: BIGGEST NO in high end snapdragons series also: card slot: up to ×××GB but uses SIM 2 slot why?;;;;;make that under $350 would have been truly flagship killer than

It has 2 gigabytes of RAM! Who needs all that extra memory with the 4 to 6 gigs of RAM? You trying to run Crysis 3 on your phone, hahah! And a 1080p display? That's still hip! 1440p is only for those lame guys who has 20/20 vision. And best of all the best processor of all time, the Snapdragon 435 ARM CPU. I mean, that sounds like it should stay in 2012 but that Adreno 505 GPU is going to make gaming somewhat better as opposed to the Adreno 405 found on the ZTE Zmax Pro. I think the ZTE Zmax Pro is still a superior phone because of the better CPU. The Nougat isn't really a selling point with me because you only get like 3 actual good features like dual multitasking, and better battery optimization.

In India the 4GB/64GB variant of Asus Zenfone 3 ZE552KL costs same as the 4GB/64GB variant of this phone, but it has a better camera with better low-light performance and OIS, better build quality, better screen quality, it has received the Nougat update. And about the Li-Po vs Li-Ion debate you made here, let me inform you that Li-Ion batteries have a higher energy density & longer lifespan than Li-Po, but are thicker, heavier and can explode if the barrier that separates the positive and negative electrode is ever breached.  Li-Po batteries on other hand are more slimmer and lightweight. They use a gel like electrolyte so they're comparatively more safer, however they have lower charge density and low life span. They both have their advantages and disadvantages. Li-Ion batteries last longer, have more life but are heavier, fatter  while Li-Po batteries don't last long, deteriorate faster with each charging cycle but are slimmer. Of course due to their gel electrode the Li-Po are comparatively safer than Li-Ion batteries.;;;;;Xiaomi mi6 is more expensive than Nubia Z17 mini, about 150USD.  and Moto g5 plus is very bad smartphone, you cant compare with Nubia Z17 mini.

Here is my review.  #A bit slippery and not many accessories available online. #Display is very good indoors but sunlight readability is very poor. #Front cam takes decent pics. #Back cam takes amazing pics in daylight and PRO mode is very useful. Has as vast camera modes. Night pics really struggles and has a noise. Pics are not sharp when zoomed in. Edges of the pic are blur in Portrait mode.  #Contrast level is poor when watching videos. #Processing speed is okay #Runs on Marshmallow and I doubt if there will be any os updates near future.  #Battery can last for a 14 hours on normal usage. 
I purchased the device for camera. The cam is good when compared with ViVo and Gionee's at same price point. However, the cam can be better with software updates (fingers crossed). Spending 20K on this, I doubt myself as there is nothing special in this mobile apart from the descent camera.  ;;;;;Who so  ever bought it can confirm its battery life cause power seems ridiculously low  I have never used nubia bak so i am afraid to buy it;;;;;Lol kidooo;;;;;Phone is little overpriced.

They started at different end, but they are slowly merging in the middle. iOS started completely as a lockdown os that is slowly opening up and Android started as a wild wild west but slowly adopting some of the iOS lockdown (although not completely) restriction nature to better handle things.;;;;;Nice looking phone, too bad about the feeble battery.;;;;;For me (If we talk about 68% - 72 % screen-to-body ratio) Nano < 3.5 inches Micro 3.5 - 4.0 inches Mini (> 4.0) - 4.5 inches  Medium (> 4.5) - 5.2 inches Large (> 5.2) - 5.7 inches Huge > 5.7 inches;;;;;battery is the biggest concern for this device, why can't they put atleast 3200 mah battery?;;;;;Why ZTE?

That and the high-end Qualcomm chip  qualifies this for cutting edge flagship status as of 4/2017, so, why Android 6 instead of 7?  Are these preliminary specs?  Also, that's a paltry number of supported LTE bands.  If there are really 2 versions (""standard"" and ""high"") might they have different sets of bands we're not seeing here?  With the bands shown this phone won't work well in North America, but it's got some excellent specs for sure.;;;;;Does the camera support ois? ;;;;;Sounds good ;;;;;for me the design and specification is tolerable, but the battery capacity is too small for now ;;;;;Especially if the second sim card is assigned as 2G connection when first sim card is 3G or 4G connection.  This is the default setting of many phones and even huawei mate 8,9 has this setting.  Worse is that some countries have stopped 2G services and what is the point of this extra sim slot??  I think the trend of telcos worldwide is upgrading the phone services to get ready for 5G by 2020 or later.  Thus 2G is on the sunset soon to free up the airwaves.;;;;;ZTE nubia numbering of smartphone, imho, is following the Intel CPU method of numbering.  Its previous model is Z7- mini, max or just Z7; then this new phone is Z17 - mini, max or Z17. Next new series could be Z27 and so on. The specs are excellent except for H264 video.;;;;;Great phone but too small for my huge hands.  I rather go for something 5,5-6,5 inches also something i can carry in my pocket. Also battery should be better.  Anyway looking great for someone other. ;;;;;He was a bit sarcastic.

I mean, normally the company's play around with the sensor position so that nobody notices. ZTE was pretty bad for me before, but now it died.;;;;;didnt get your point could u plz elaborate!!!;;;;;2nd Disappoint is sim+memory card, there should be a slot on other side for memory card, worst part, else make it a single sim pphone, whats the needd to make it dual sim.;;;;;Its a lot new phone, iam great fan of Nubia series phone, i own nubia Z11 but this phone doesnt have much changes done to it, OS should be Nougat7.0, rear cam should have been 23/24MP, 6GB RAM is excellent, PPI is less it should be more than 441,final conclusion-Good for Nothing, better buy Nubia Z11 Mini S. All same features.;;;;;Disappointed with SOC & main camera sensor. Waiting for device with SD660 SOC, 4GB RAM, 64GB ROM, decent single camera with OIS, 5 to 5.2"" screen, 3500mAh battery & slime bazles design etc.;;;;;if 5.2"" is mini then 5"" is micro and (iPhone 7) 4.7"" is nano!!!;;;;;Its great camera.. But the software is ;;;;;should've 4100 mAh battery;;;;;Nope, Huawei uses inferior Kirins. Xiaomi has subpar quality in things like the camera;;;;;Means mini battery in the chuncky chasis. Decent specs phone but out of sight from what Huawei and Xiaomi offers..;;;;;5.2"" is mini? oh my god.... minis should be below 5"";;;;;Even the Slamsuck A3 isn't 130mm and it's very expensive, about Â150 more than other phones with same or better specs. ;;;;;galaxy a3 has remained under 5"" 3yrs in a row i hop it stays tht way;;;;;Does the battery last long? If so it is an excellent phone. ;;;;;It really isn't a 'small' upgrade over the axon 7 mini. The snapdragon 617 in the axon is a couple of years old now, is pretty slow and hasn't got a small manufacturing proces, so that made it need more battery power to run. I'll give you that they're released close to eachother, but this comes way closer to the ZTE nubia Z11 mini S.;;;;;Switching from S617 to S653 is a small improvement? Rather a big one. But still - why use such an old SoC? Should've used S660.;;;;;They are going to have to start calling them micro, nano or piko soon, if anything will ever be under 5"" screen, ever again. :-/;;;;;5.2 is mini ? how about z17 tiny ?

Despite being a small battery, it seems that ZTE optimizes the operating system well, since it lasts two days the battery, listening to music and receiving some calls, and playing video games.

ZTE,Blade V8 Pro,";;;;;ZTE doesn't even say the screen is IPS, only Full HD and TFT.

Bye.;;;;;I love this phone IÂm not a heavy phone user and this phone does everything I need and more itÂs fun and ez to use the only thing I donÂt like is the only hard case I can find is the one zte makes and sells I would like more choices but am vary happy over all I would recommend this phone to anyone looking to get a new phone but does not want or can not get an expensive phone ;;;;;Thanks a lot DV.  I loved seeing those photos.  It gives me new ideas of what I can do with my Blade V8 Pro camera now.;;;;;I press the button with one of the fingers that I use to read my fingerprint. I press it down and it clicks on and immediately unlocks.  The only extra effort is pushing down until you feel it click.  You can start the phone with the side power button also and then unlock it with the reader without having to make the front button click.  It's really not a problem.;;;;;I'm using mine on AT&T and I'm getting 4G LTE.;;;;;Mine actually works great on Facebook.  It's really fast. When I tap the icon, it's ready to go in about 3 seconds.  Practically instantly if you have it running in the background.  I've never had a problem with Facebook on this phone.;;;;;Not true, at least now. I got mine a week ago, home button can act as screen on and fingerprint scanner at same time. Also no issues with Facebook;;;;;Great price from Amazon. Feels good, solid, stylish. Fingerprint sensor works very well as long as you set it up right. I LOVE having a home button- an actual button. Those ""stereo speaks"" you see in the photos ain't stereo. It's one speaker only, not stereo. That's a disappointment. Would it kill mobile companies to put those speakers in the front? I guess so. I know other ZTE models have it, not this one. 14nm CPU though- very fast, low power, long battery life. I wanted a better camera stereo speakers but for the money, I got a lot.;;;;;good thing I dont use facebook :P ;;;;;Handset is not supported to 4G services ...any solution;;;;;This phone is not worth it.

ZTE,Blade V8,";;;;;Does it support both capturing devices and peripheral card readers via Serial Port Profile (SPP)?;;;;;This actually has 2 rear facing identical color cameras. You could use it for 3D photography. Even many of the other dual camera phone models have 1 color and 1 monochrome, so this phone has a slight advantage for that feature alone. You can't even find a 3D camera for less than $200. Let alone one that does 13MP! Not bad. And with a Sanpdragon 435 core, it doesn't completely suck as a personal computing device either. ;;;;;why?;;;;;Bought it for 149Â, it´s pretty good for that price and replaces my - back in the day - way too expensive S7 Edge.  It´s biggest strength is, that it doesn´t have any real weaknesses.  Good screen, good battery run time, good calling quality, great fingerprint scanner, very decent camera and audio via Bluetooth and AUX. It also has Dual SIM (shared), wich is a viable option with 32GB internal memory. The only real downsides are the lack of 5GHz WLAN and the weak main speaker. The Mifavor UI does, despite the not very potent Snapdragon 435 (it´s sufficient for almost all 3D games though), work more fluently and stable than my S7 Edge ever did. I like it, good phone if you get it cheap. ;;;;;zte is really bad ;;;;;blade v8  7.0 frp? help me;;;;;It says that this phone is dual sim, but however in the manual for the phone is doesn't mention anything about dual sim.

Soon after that, the company realized that this phone is too good be given out like that and downgraded the offer to phones with 1GB RAM and 8GB ROM and 5MP camera. The major issue with this phone is that the 16G isn't nearly enough storage, because is the operating system takes up like 9G (for what? can't imagine) and you can't move the apps to the SD card.

Overall my impression is very good. And the phone is definitely worth the 250$ and it even outperforms some flagship phones! There are only a few minor issues you should be aware of: 1. Battery charging is not very fast (as mentioned by others) (it takes ~6 hours to charge from 0% to 100%) Battery itself is average, same as all the other flagship phones - it lasts 3 days with normal daily usage. 2. There is no optical image stabilization (but that isn't really a problem since you can use apps like openCamera, which have incredible digital stabilization) But the video/photo quality is really nice. That's it! I can't think of any more drawbacks!  I was afraid that it won't be able to connect to my local GSM network (i live in a small 3rd world country: Latvia) but so far everything is working nicely.

It should have at least 512RAM same as the ROM as with the new release HTC's and Co.... unless you wanted it to be a dated fone B4 it is released! especially when there is no other internal other than the memory card. ;;;;;Yes!!QWERTY!!Wooo!!;;;;;Live shots:   ""You get the same snappy 1GHz inside the K01, plus this time the huge 4.1"" screen is AMOLED rather than LCD."";;;;;Battery life could be limited - only 1000mAh? Limited available internal memory compare to some coming phones, and Camera - only 3MP? Nothing better than VGA video? Could be better...;;;;;Dear Toshiba  The only touch screen with full physical qwerty keyboard that is NOT a brick....you got a winner, we can now forget about the Xperia and HTC's! Get the weight right and you will kill the market, I for one will buy on it's release but only if the weight is no more than 130gm NO PORKY Please!!!;;;;;Toshiba you are AWESOME, please see my comment! :) And please put Led flash on your AWESOME phones, and all will be perfect.;;;;;Is it the same AMOLED like Samsung Wave (Super AMOLED)?

Hope that a new TG in window phone 7 is on the way. Being thin is not the most important, performance is.;;;;;as a user of TG01 I can say that: 1. 1000mAh battery is not enough!!! (only keeps charge for 2 days) 2. no 3.5 mm jack is painfull, but you can listen music through uUSB jack  3. uUSB jack on the side of the phone is not very comfortable 4. when you make a uUSB jack on the side, why not provide a L-shaped uUSB headphone?! 5. 1000mAh battery is not enough!!! 6. no answer/reject hardware buttons :( 7. screen is awesome (especially on the TG02 model I guess) 8. but 1000mAh battery is not enough!;;;;;Toshiba is really trying its best to shoot itself in the leg. Maybe they have too much profit and they are trying to loose some. Why can they not just try and let this phone be near perfect. What will it cost to put a 1500Mah battery and 5 mp camera?;;;;;4.1 inches screen with 1000 mAh battery. i'm wondering how many hours could this phone run after every full charge.;;;;;what the F?! SBP mobile shell runs this phone only...noo wayy for 1gb ram;;;;;Lol @ SPB mobile shell;;;;;We need to get this guy shorten! TG03 will be W7 ;;;;; ;;;;;No it won't. WP7S needs a 5.0 mp camera with flash. This does not have that. ;;;;;This might be able to get WP7, it has necessary buttons, matching resolution and necessary RAM/ROM!;;;;;i think it will have a better luck   with wp7  than hd2;;;;;Sad to read touch CAPACITIVE screen, one thing I have learned through using the TG01 is you NEED a stylus, and not just for the keypad which seems to be upgraded to keyboard. The other specs look almost identical, hey you can get the TG01 at 129 quid at Orange UK stores, bargain of the century! I think the TG01 should have been modified in cosmetic design had proximity sensor added, to enable screen to be centrally positioned, and a radio added. Better speaker/s would have been nice, preferably side or front mounted. Get rid of the flimsy annoying flap on mini usb port too.;;;;;wtf only 1000mAh????;;;;;Well I don't know this exactly, I know only rumors said it is waterproof!;;;;;This phone is waterproof or splash resistant officially?maybe just a rumor...Toshiba...;;;;;Its just a TG01 with a capacative TFT......nothing more or less..... Toshiba sucks in my opinion, they give out the goodies very slow so they can get more money from you! I can tell TG03 would be capacative AMOLED screen lol...;;;;;Wider release for this phone, Toshiba...;;;;;Looks like a remake of TG01, which is very good to a degree. But surely this phone is just a cosmetic makeover. What would be better is if they had improved the form factor, still a small screen for such large body, height wise that is. Better camera, able to video I hope beyond the ten min's of TG01. Still the ugly status led present, lets hope this is not the final version to hit the shops. I actually believe the TG01 under winmo 6.5 is fantastic, it should have been better marketed. Any V2 should be upgraded in the spec's dept.;;;;;I think it is a good, phone, how many phones has 4.1 inch OLEd WVGA screen with 1GHZ CPU??? If you don't like it, you can leave the forum. Japan is more advanced then any others in the world. :);;;;;Terrible Specs according to what would be expected. At least 5mpx camera. 500MB of RAM or near that. That's just to survive. To thrive: AMOLED Screen, Internal Storage, FM Radio...;;;;;i think it will get the wp7 series   the wp7 series will  be released  only after 4 monthes  if not less  after the release of  tgo2  so what ;;;;;LOL compare it to the TG01...any real noticable differences? Why no 5mp camera? Come on Toshiba!!!;;;;;Stand-by 5h and Talk time 275 h ??? :P This is the first phone with better talk time then stand-by :D;;;;;And Toshiba can make fingerprint sensor phones, so you want to tell me they are not good?? Og please, don't make me laugh. :);;;;;I don't cry man, just I know Japan is Japan, and Europe is Europe! There are VERY BIG differences between Europe and Japan! Japan has waterproof phones, they have wallet phones, they have phones with extreme cameras, they have phones with big screens like we have. :) They(Sharp) has XGA screen phones for example. :) What do you think?? Oh and I forget to tell Japan will enter in global markets, Sharp will attack Samsung and LG too! And Nokia ofcourse. They will lead the screen technology and camera technology!;;;;;You don't believe me right? If you have 1500 Euro to spend, tell Toshiba do you want an 1GHZ CPU phone with at least 8mP camera, 4.1 inch OLED screen, any OS(NOT MAC OS or Blackberry OS ofcourse), 16GB internal memory, waterproof... and they will make it for you! :) And they has a 14.6 MP sensor!! WOW! :);;;;;toshiba is a good company, hell even apple buys stuff from them to put in the iphone, toshiba should really make a phone thats not to long, the tgo1 ws too long, make a smaller phone, not too long, and not to wide, then youll have a kick ass phone, ;;;;;Beautiful phone but hopefully this time the availabities can be at reach world wide;;;;;Well, you must agree that it's awsome the +250h talk time at least!;;;;;dont cry man, toshiba will do something 4u. lolz;;;;;is that so?who said so?this phone doesnt suits me..LOL..i still proud of my iphone n BB..hahaha..;;;;;Why would they release the same cellphone again with another name???;;;;;Its interesting to hear that. I thought they should market the phone that way. Upgradeable to series 7. Just like HTC HD2. But there are some rumours that WinPho 7 requires atleast 512 MB RAM, atleast 5 MP camera and the camera should have flash. I don't believe the camera part but probably the RAM part is the reason that Toshiba is not confirming the upgrade to WinPho 7. Its sad, who'd buy it then. Probably that'll leave the space for TG03... WTF!!!!;;;;;haha 5 hour standby;;;;;Toshiba you are a GOOD company, but PLEASE put better cameras on your phones, and put LED flash too, and you will be perfect. This phone has all the things I need, and many others need.;;;;;put android in and i'll buy it.;;;;;I spoke to a guy on the Toshiba stand today and asked if the TG-02 was upgradable to Windows 7 Mobile. He just smiled and said 'no comment', read between the lines! The phone does look nice, but then so did the TG-01. For me it's a choice between this running the new Windows OS and the HTC Desire for my next handset, was going to upgrade to a 3GS but iPhones are looking VERY dated now!;;;;;lol 275 h talking time xD;;;;;275h of talk time???;;;;;this model has Exactly the same specifications of the previous one. The only difference is that the windows mobile version is different and that gave the c**ts a reason to change the model no. Toshiba actually pays employees to change model names/ no. ???? without changing the features ???? that must be the best job in the world !;;;;;3.15 MP is totally outdated... grow up Toshiba BTW... I'm the first;;;;;Hmmm.... Capacitive Screen.... Toshiba already aiming for WinMo 7 which is nice. It'll be only the second phone after HTC HD2 with capacitive (I guess). I like the fact that its 3.15 MP camera. Hope performance is what it delivers and please don't even bother about the mindless Mega Pixel race. But it'll only be worthy if it has a wider release than TG01. Bring it to India Toshiba...;;;;;looks good........this time only model touch screen ;;;;;So it's a tg01 with a capacitive screen?

That price only suits 4 veteran flagships,such as nokia E90. N for current flagships,such as galaxy nexus,iphone 4s,etc Too many drawbacks,tooo many!;;;;;the  main drawbacks about this phone are  having lack of capacitive screen, less battery capacity,less responsive motion sensor, problems of gps, otherwise   the phone  is excellent its  hardware  and steardy scratch proof body is  beyond compare,only nokia hardware can be compared, no effect of minor jerks shocks. my phone felled hundred of times but no damage done. it also got drenched twice but still working. responsive touch, excellent graphics are advantages.  the wm 6.5 was only os at that time we can also change it to android, wp7  other problem can be solved by flashing better clean rom by  visiting different forums like xda.;;;;;those who have bought this phone should get a refund. its rubbish terrable and unreliable. it restarts for no apparent reason and when u want to close a programme u have to go to task manager... and theres no other way. buy this phone if its very cheap and your desperate to HAVE a phone but if u have a choice leave this one last!;;;;;You can use Microsoft marketplace and Freewarepocketpc.net have one.;;;;;Does it have an market/ app store?;;;;;The Best Phone;;;;;The Best Phone;;;;;found solution for  ""network massages"" problem it is because of cell broadcast,  disable or delete the settings from  start menu> setting> personal> phone> channel  after pressing  channel button it will show different channels, from menu button below opt for delete all and press ok now restart the phone. you will no longer receive  ""network massages"" from different cell towers. after doing this i observed that i got rid of unwanted broadcast cell tower massages, and my battery life is  doubled i am satisfied with this phone now  rj;;;;;using for 1 and half years  still could not find solution for problems in this tg01 - poor battery backup  9 to 10 hours only even with   power saving settings & without using internet multimedia etc -unwanted network massages which always pop up causing trouble using interface  -unfriendly finger controls especially small scroll bars -frequent connectivity problems with pc very difficult to connect with pc -very small title bar -while calling we cannot brouse the phone    hope all these problems will be solved in wp7 rom for  this phone;;;;;I have had this phone for an average time period and i have to say it is the WORST phone i have EVER had. The Windows is great yes and its upgrade-able to 2011 because i have upgraded it to that but its battery life is appalling, honestly it doesn't last 6 hours for me, and when i charge it i have problems turning it on and in the end it manages to turn on with no battery. Also  you can only have the background shown on the picture as any others you choose cause significant battery loss. This phone is not efficient in any way but when it does work it is very technical and is a wondrous piece of tech, it's just a shame it can't be like that the whole of the time, then it would be a model phone. Also the camera quality is shit at times but brilliant at others although the slightest movements will blur your image, amazingly the action shots that it actually has a very good, it takes them very well and they look great but its not very good at stills (and yes i have got my camera settings right) overall, its a brilliant phone WHEN IT WILL TURN ON!!!!

From there, you will be guided through the whole process (be careful that you will be asked on phone side to allow the install of the program - just say yes and let it to do the job). Also, pay attention: if the *.exe file was not made as a *.cab install, you won't be able to install it on your phone! It will give you the usual error: ""the file is not a 32/64 bit"", usually for a normal windows install.

Looking forward to end of contract.;;;;;This is an absolute beauty! No phone will ever be this thin with a giant snapdragon within! It's speed and size amazes me - big, but sleek! Those who are moaning about it not being good - it is because you don't have any know-how of windows phones. You have never tweaked anything! If that is the case stick to Nokia or baby iPhone - those are the phones for girls. Windows is a man's phone. If you are a man you can take risks and is ready to spend couple of hours to make the phone customized, go for TG01, you won't regret. I own 3 of them alreadya and can't get enough! Watching movies, listening, browsing, edit word documents, making presentations, excel spreadsheets, remote desktop sharing - EVERYTHING IS SO WONDERFULLY FAST. Flash a new rom - ORANGE HAS MESSED up the software by editing it. Just remove the rom - flash it. Go visit XDA website- for very easy manual on how to flash and also to choose a ROM that will suit you!! I hope you will love this phone soon :) BUY IT - IT'S WORTH ALL THE PENCE YOU PUT IN!;;;;;It is a great phone with more advanced options, but it is not for user with low level knowledge of WM.

Toshiba help care "" totally careless.  i really cant be bothered to go on about this so called phone i had spent months going on about it to tosh !  just save yourself some serious hassle walk away no matter what they offer you to take it out of there shop. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ;;;;;Why cant the phone read chinese??;;;;;Came here to ask about the phone. The few pages here explain everything quite well though. :D Thanks for saving others guys ! God bless you and good luck.;;;;;If u don't know to use phone then use something simpler. Touch works fine.U can find many possibilities in this phone....;;;;;Worst phone I've used for a long while, the specs look great but the unresponsive resistive touch screen, the awful windows operating system make it a chore to use.  I had a chance to play with the Desire and an iphone recently and this phone isnt even in the same ball park as those phones in terms of useability.  There is some efforts being made in porting Android to it over at xda developers which may make it a worthwhile second hand purchase one day, but it is still in its infancy and will take a long time to be fully functional. Resale value of this phone - thanks in large to the Orange shops in the uk selling them off at £150 at christmas is less than £100 - I paid nearly £300 for this a year ago so that is really poor!  Avoid like the plague I say. There are miles better phones out there, especially the Android phones. Toshiba's loyalty to Windows Mobile is a mystery!;;;;;how did you do it;;;;;hi there, just saw your post. can you please share how you got Android on your TG01? you can come to TG01 forum on xda-developers to guide us if you prefer..   thanks;;;;;My native is Thiruvannamalai NOW CAMP at Pondicherry ,I wish to buy this mobile were can i get this phone in pondicherry. please guide me to buy this mobile with waranty.Help me This is my mail id (ganesh.polur@gmail.com)....... .........THANKS FOR YOUR HELPING HAND..........;;;;;Yes,much better.;;;;;is it better than nokia 5800§;;;;;I have just returned my iPhone 4, got a refund and replaced it with the TG01. The original ROM (6.1) was awfull. Then i updated to the official Toshiba/Orange 6.5 and it was a little better. And finally i loaded a XDA Cooked Win Mo 6.5.5 ROM and now it's really great ! 6.5.5 is really finger-friendly, and this ROM is more stable, faster, more reactive; has a better sound.;;;;;Best phone for this money.Simply perfect for me.;;;;;Best phone for this money.Simply perfect for me.;;;;;Best phone for this money.;;;;;I have the Windows Mobile 6.5 Version of TG01 for 4 Months and I think it is a GREAT PHONE. The display is huge and very responsive. It is one the fastest Phone whit WM 6.5 on the market today. It works well with Navigation software and surfing on the Internet is a preasure.  I dont like the short battery life - only 1 day and the fakt that it sometimes hangs up when I thy to use Opera or Googlemaps. I think that all modern Smartphones have such issues but only a few have such advantages (1GHz CPU; 4,1"" Display, nice desing)  so I think TG01 is a really nice phone. And dont forget - It is the first Handy EVER to have 1GHz CPU - so it already has a place in the history books. ;;;;;I too gained the phone as a replacement.  I would rather have been sent a homing pigeon, a pen and paper or a Nokia 3210. I want to destroy it, so I can send it back.  Livid.;;;;;I was given this phone by orange,as a replacement and I have not had it for more than a day yet!! It is the worst phone I have ever had. It constantly connects up to the internet. The back is difficult to put on. It's too big. It does not have a stylus attached to it. AWFUL phone DO NOT BUY!!!! I would rather have an old fashioned brick phone!!  ;;;;;up date it as option with samsung i9000 galaxy s,Htc Hd2,sony ericsson experia 10, not its design nice designed phone ever i seen.;;;;;Today my fifth phone turned up. It's not even coming out of the box. I don't know how to cook ROM's and should not have to anyway. Battery life is appalling. Its like watching the fuel gauge on a V8 car suck the contents out of a fuel tank at speed. For me all the listed issues on this thread are real. I have suffered them all. I want my money back. Come Monday morning I am cancelling my direct debit and Orange will then have to wake up to the fact I mean what I say. 
I am a very unhappy Orange customer.
 
Anyone got Vodafone's number?
;;;;;  I got this phone a few months ago from orange uk(a very good price)First impression?Very BAD,slow ,not very responsive,average camera,very unreliable motion sensor.crashed a lot.But I unlocked it and changed the rom(cooked one)and it made a huge difference!I'm using it on 3 uk and when using Opera on good signal area it is amazingly fast!!!The motion sensor is responsive now and after installing a little piece of free software I can use Igo8 (which in my opinion is better than tom tom) .Spb shell looks and performs very well and the quality of calls has improved a lot.It looks like  the tg01 is a reliable piece of hardware but the ORANGE ROM makes it useless,so if you  buy one,better change the rom !;;;;;As a pocket computer it lives up to the specs, although it is completely hobbled by the utterly useless Windows Mobile. Even with SPB Mobile Shell running on it, which was the only way I could find to make it remotely user-friendly, the cruddy little interface, designed for styluses, not fingers, is always lurking to get in your way just when it is most inconvenient.  If you have experience of using a multi-touch capacitive screen the TG01 will infuriate you. Granted, the massive real estate and high resolution are fantastic for movies, the internet and email but it is grimly unresponsive; especially so with a screen protector fitted.  Answering calls can be a joke, with the user reduced to frantically swiping at the screen to answer while Windows tries to wake up. When you finally do manage to get it to respond (or, more usually, have to call back) the call quality tends to start off more or less acceptable and then deteriorate rapidly. Calls are frequently dropped and with every one of the four replacement handsets which Orange have foisted upon me, the person at the other end starts complaining within a minute or so that my speech is being cut up so badly they cannot make out what I am saying. I have resorted to using a five-year old Motorola which is clear as a bell, so go figure.  Conclusion: Great as a pocket-sized internet tablet but in twenty-five years of mobile phone use I have never had such a dog, such a lemon, such a massive pile of excrescence as this phone.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS AND *DO NOT* ALLOW ORANGE TO REPLACE ANY PHONE WITH THIS ONE. I have heard from the fellow delivering my many replacement phones that this is what they are attempting to do with all their unused and justifiably unloved TG01's. You have been warned.;;;;;very good phone if you know what you are doing, i got mine in the post yesterday and withing 3 hours i cooked me own rom to debrand and fix some common bugs, lets face it with all phones they all have issues which are man made, so man can fix them simply!!!   akatrojan@hotmail.com;;;;;DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE - You have been warned. I am on my third from Orange and all phones have suffered from static noises every minute or so which makes me inaudible and winds up my customers no end! Nothing wrong with WM6.5 it is a vast improvement over 6.1 and works well, unfortunately the actual phone doesn't! In addition to the static noises I have just lost all sounds from my phone like one of the other posts mentions. Do yourself a favour and avoid hours on the phone with your operator complaining and battling to get a new replacmeent model that is of similar spec - buy a different phone! Richard;;;;;I am on my THIRD body since Feb 2010.  All 3 have come up with the same faults. The phone gets a fault and will no longer make any sounds or vibrate even though these features are enabled.  Result - missed calls and out of date texts.  The only way to resolve the issue is to fully re-boot the phone, battery off is best. The other really irritating thing is the time it takes to answer the phone - 8-10 seconds before it sorts itself out enough for the screen swipe function to work - result more missed calls. Orange (my provider) will only replace the phone like for like untill I have logged the same fault at least three times !!!!!!!!! Am waiting for my fourth handset as I write. Advice - DON'T GET A TG01
;;;;;you can not compare this phone with HD2 because they are different generations of smartphones the tg01 is more than OK - windows ROM is a terrible choice for it, some guys are cooking custom roms just to get rid off the wm 6.5 and i'm using 6.5.5 for 2 weeks now with no problems - voice clarity much better - gps - flawless - internet over wifi or mobile excellent - battery life improved 24 hours flat - much faster touch response  etc.  ;;;;;I am on my second body of the Toshiba TG01. Its the worst phone I have ever owned. I had it as an upgrade since February. People I talk to can't hear me, They always sound crackly. The replacement will now not sync with the PC, so all my contacts are locked on the pc. The Bluetooth on the PC cannot find the phone.  The battery life is abysmal. I have to charge the thing up twice a day. The internet connection is ok, but the adobe flash player cannot open some sites as its not compatible. Trying to download a better version does not work. Very very dissapointed.
 
Wanted a HTC HD2 but was talked into taking this by Orange as the spec seemed the same.
 
I think its time I went to Vodaphone.;;;;;this is an amazing phone.  i have attached my usb keyboard and mouse to it.. and they work perfectly well. you can also connect your usb mem stick to it.. and it will read and transfer the files no problem from your usb stick to the phone and visa versa..  i have also installed a software that can use the GPS without using the data packets from the provider.. all i do is go to google maps, find where i want to go, and write down the co-ordinates of the destination... then input it in the phone and it tells me which direction to go and how far and how long with the present speed.. unfortunately i dont have any maps.. but for my purposes with my bicycle .. it is perfect..  i totally recommend this phone. ;;;;;cool stuff..can i promoted this product and your site on my blog (Indonesia)? thx ;;;;;Awful - would be brilliant if it all worked, I mean I want people to be able to hear me it is  a phone.   Its windows mobile so it would be nice if the usb - activesync or Mobile device ctr worked , and I could transfer files.  Crashes - try running Google maps twice without resetting in between, sometimes notice it rebooting when sitting on the desk and the splash screen comes up.  Battery life, dont make me laugh.  It wont work with tomtom. somthing disabled - check forums im on my 5th one now & stuck in contract.
 
Orange have withdrawn this phone for some reason ;;;;;I have this phone and I am absolutly satisfied with it. Super fast, Super thin. And with the price range there's no other to compare with! The only downside I see it's the camera and the lack of flash but, seriously, is anybody using its's phone as a real camera for taking vacations shots? Don't believe it.. If you need the camera to upload pics to social networks, the 3.2 mpx is more than enough;;;;;i own the phone - i'm using it every day  tried an usb mouse on it and an usb mem stick, i don't have a usb keyboard but i think it might work as well. despite it's 4 inch screen is much pocket friendly that i expected.;;;;;It has a virtual d-pad, you can bring it to life by a vertical stroke on screen, also doubles as a virtual mouse pad. For a resistive screen, it's VERY sensitive. Can anybody tell me if you can use a USB keyboard using the USB adapter provided?;;;;;Do you actually own this phone?  A lot of people comment upon speculation. This phone as a multi-media device is excellent. Ok not too hot as a phone as call quality and speaker loudness are a little below par, but it's very slim  despite it's overall size it's not bulky. The visual quality is fantastic, it's a darn fast phone too, try need for speed underground and throw your psp away!  The audio quality through headphones could send you deaf with audible pleasure. Core player as standard ditto office. And for those within the uk only 129  pounds on prepay. It's a must have, the snapdragon processor is superb. Buy buy buy!;;;;;i have this ppc for 6 months now and i can say that is a good piece of hardware - is good on the internet, Gps works like a charm, big display for vdeos and browsing, smooth touch with spb mobile, only if the battery was bigger;;;;;hey people,,i want to go and buy this phone,,can someone please tell me what unique fancy applications this phone has other that gps,camera,bluetooth and wifi..please i need your cooperation;;;;;Unfortunately it doesn't. Mine came with Windows Mobile 6.5 installed in and doesn't support Arabic neither.;;;;;Horrible piece of hardware.  Incredibly slow.  Overcomplicated.  Doesn't work.  Stay clear of this horrible piece of tech if you value your sanity.;;;;;ohmygawd, i have crush on this phone since the 1st time.;;;;;does this phone support Arabic language;;;;;evrr since i had this phone, i can say dat its d most common toys i have ever had.its a product u can be proud of.i advice everyone to have it,and u ll enjoy it...;;;;;Hi, got toshiba tg01, but unfortunatly m unable to use it here in pakistan, cz stil the country code hasnt been opend, i received code of 8digits from company whil giving them IME no. bt stil its un-acceptable, wana help, would be so thankful in this regard. ;;;;;This is the best phone that i have ever had. TG01 + SPB and Windows Mobile 6.5 i should recomend it to everybody.;;;;;Got this as it had a great spec. Then it arrived. Need to use the stylus as I have big fingers - no port. USB Micro socket at the side. Reset button under the rear cover - given how much this phone crashes, that is a real pain. Very soft, hard to hear, crackle and static on a call. Random freezes. Crashes during a call. Runs windows mobile 6.5 which I like, but should have gone for a mature phone manufacturer (read HTC) On my 3rd handset, negotiating to get a phone that will *actually* make a phone call. So dissapointed...;;;;;I bought my TG01 on Ebay, it's GREAT, everything works as it should. It has a lot of SPB software on it, and also Navmii Sat. Nav. I don't think the previous owner was happy with it, or why sell? But I am. I also love Windows 6.5, and all the Windows knockers (be it mobile or normal), can go take a running jump. Before this I had a HP Ipaq HW 6915 with Windows 5, which was also great, but it was time for an update.;;;;;The specs for this one could do with being updated, the UI is much better now than the one on the original release. However, as with any windows phone the only way to get a good user experience is to install SPB Mobile Shell which removes the standard (always flawed) software and replaces it with a much smoother, easier to use UI;;;;;This is a great phone, (when it works properly). I on my third one now, it keeps freezing up and you have to remove the battery to re-boot it. and when you try to connect to the internet, it keeps sending error reports back. and the battery life is rubbish.;;;;;it is also avail in white lol;;;;;just a suggestion it will be so cool if it has different colours dont u think it will make it more attractive;;;;;HAd this phone for about 3 weeks now after previously using the iphone 3gs. Yes its bigger than said iphone but my god is it better :). Love the fact that I can plug my pen drive into it and watch AVI's straight away with Core Player and also I CAN actualy bluetooth files too and from the device. Good work (for a change) Toshiba.;;;;;Are you sure this phone doesn't have any call dropping issues and muffled voice for the listeners who you call?;;;;;Hello peeps, is this phone upgradable to win7??? thank you ;;;;;too big, navigation around the device is difficult becuase of no Dpad, plus resistive touch screen, no hole to place stylus, texting is not easy....gave up!;;;;;Looks good;;;;;Looks like a good GPS app.  I would be interested to see how well it worked: ;;;;;I think your right, it might get the 6.5.3/6.6 upgrade.  It looks like MS have really decided to get away from 'windows mobile 6.x', which is reflected in the PR spin of the new trade mark 'Windows Phone x'. The mobile phone market is so damn competitive at the moment; iPhone, Android, Symbian, Windows Phone, MeeGo.. I don't actually have a TG01, but I was very tempted because of the hardware relative to value.  It would be great if Android could be hacked to work, but I'm not going to play the waiting game :-);;;;;@Peter It will not come as a upgrade. Windows 7 Mobile is a brand new bulid from the ground up. It would be like having to put a new OS on the phone. I just don't think that they are going to mess with it. They have already said that they are not making a windows mobile 7. (notice I switched the 7, that is very important.) If i am correct, starting now, give microsoft about one more year of support for winmo6.5 and they will just give up on it. But that is my two cents. Take it or leave it.;;;;;this phone is huuuuggggeeeee!!!!!;;;;;No joy with Android, maybe it will happen in the future! Will Windows Phone (Windows Mobile 7) be a free upgrage? ... Bloody should be :-)  Incredible hardware, the Height/Width aren't much of an issue the main this is it's slim.;;;;;Resistive touchscreen... another failed telephone.;;;;;i paid 9euros at orange.fr htc is beeter;;;;;Mate go on their website and update the new software.;;;;;i felt in love with toshiba tg01,becouse the big screen,and the 1 ghz processor,and wi-fi.but... when i try to connect to wireless,there is no way to do this.. when i want to send a pic wia bluetoth no way,i mean ..send-wia sms,mms.but no bluetoth.. some times(many times)is not answering to my touch.. so what can i do?? i want to give it back today,cz is useless for me..sorry;;;;;Hi v57,  Could you please share with us where and how did you changed the OS to Android. Would really appreciate that. Thanks for your help in advance.;;;;;Hi all , i have this phone, some say its good some that is great and some say its rubbish , but as i am using it i can say its a great device , with no problems at all. I would like to ask people that know , how is it possible to go on android and where can it be done? Thank you;;;;;Battery poor,no trade in value,phone keypad locking cant delete it.I wish hadn't purchased it.Lumbered now!!!;;;;;this phone is garbage... the UI that toshiba made its not stable.. lag very bad with a 1ghz processor... waste of money....would not recommend to anyone....;;;;;Sounds interesting Android working on TG01, but surely the Tosh has no built in digital compass? Android apps take advantage of that. Surely, an HTC Android phone would be better. I think TG01 is good (well with winmo 6.5) as it stands. Cupcake 1.5 looks nice on Android, but windows has it's own advantages too. I think Toshiba have made a first rate phone, very much a first for them. It needs a makeover cosmetically, maybe other colours and perhaps other networks within the UK a chance (apart from Orange) to retail it, 3 would be great (as Orange are famous giving 2.5g sims on payg YOU HAVE TO ASK for a 3g sim, how daft!).;;;;; 1 GHz processor...wow...compliments!!!;;;;;Hi V57, Pls help us by posting your TG01 Android ROM to a space which we can download. Thanks.;;;;;Congragulations the wonderful toshiba tg01 is the gps mobile device of the year 2009. Alongside non gps Lg viewty;;;;;Hi mate, where did you get android on TG01?;;;;;hi guys .i got this phone 1 mounth ago .u bilive it or not  but i change os to android. and afterthat u can see how  its work its awsome. briliant.now this is a monster. only 1 disapointmet and that is camera. so evrybudy try this  os and see how is work.;;;;;I have not noticed any problems with pieces coming off back cover of TG01. However, i have experienced problems in the past, Nokia 5800 for example. Contrary to manufacturer's advice, if you have a plain plastic back, like TG01, you can remove cover and wash in luke warm soapy water and allow to dry at room temperature, it is just plasic and can be cleansed as such. To remove scratches, believe it or not (however, do NOT recommend with touch screen phones), one trick that seems to work is Brasso the metal polish, is has very fine abrasives, and the chemical does not seem to cause any major damage to either plastic or mineral glass. I am sure the manufacturer's would not advise, but it seems to work.;;;;;Totally agree, I've had mine for a few weeks now and love it! Will post a full review soon.;;;;;£149 from Orange, why complain? Mega deal or what, let's see it now comes with WM 6.5 as standard, Office and Core Player. Have you seen the games? Snapdragon at 1Ghz and Open GL in your hand, where is the bin for that chunky PSP (only joking!). This is not a phone it's a technical marvel for the price. It is NOT Huge in your pocket actually, see it's so slim you hardly notice it unlike say a Nokia 5800. My only complaint is the mini USB port as sole connectivity with fiddly plastic cover, better to have had power headphone and USB power ports like Nokia. Compared to the T-mobile Pulse, the only other similar payg phone in the UK, well your not stuck with only as many apps fit into your phone memory, I give 11 out of 10 for this phone, if you can track one down go for it!;;;;;no orange only have the black model . but you can find the white one on amazon and it,s unlocked .. i have just had my tg01 unlocked at a massive £30 but worth it to be on three. works fine put my sim card in and it works great;;;;;love the phone, very good phone,i have had it for 2 months no problems. Good phone toshiba, but will need to improve  wmb 6.5 with the microsoft guys.;;;;;love this phone the best ive had;;;;;can someone tell me the online banking performance for this phone. thanks;;;;;I've been using this phone for about 2 weeks now and I've found some more problems with this phone. I was trying to wipe grease/sweat marks off the back of the phone and I started to notice little tiny bits coming off and it was the phones back itself being rubbed off. Now when i look at the back in light and at certain angles, I can notice all the marks where its been rubbed off. This phone also seems to get quite warm, mainly with Wifi use. Also, every once in a while, when I get a text and try to view it, the phone freezes and requires a reset/battery removal. Im finding that my disappointment is growing with this phone and Im beginning to think that maybe that I shouldnt have give orange £149 for it...;;;;;i have seen this phone in the orange shop.it may be a good phone but if your looking for a phone you can fit in your pocket this is not it.Its HUGEE!;;;;;Not much info or interest in this fone since its had an upgrade to 6.5 ..Weird how other mobiles get an announcement if an upgrade is done or a second chance???;;;;;Finally a phone better than iphone htc and blackberry;;;;;ty for the info brynn checked that site and they do a monster 3000+mah battery for tg01 on that mugen site epic so if 1000mah standard battery lasts 1 day average the mugen battery will last 3-4 days woop YOU LOSE IPHONE :);;;;;I cant find out what colour either..;;;;;The site says the 1300 milliamp will fit normally but the other 2 sizes have a new back for tg01..My e52/e72 have 1500milliamp batterys and the mugen one is 1800milliamp and fits fine in both devices but the larger batterys come with new covers...I have got bigger batterys for n95-1 and n96 and both had new back covers and none interfered with camera lens..;;;;;another lazy question do orange uk sell tg01 in white? or just black?;;;;;veryyy loww not buy  wm6 slow;;;;;sorry brynn for a stupid question but the extended batterys for the tg01 are they the same size as the 1000mah default battery as the case would have to be altered if larger?;;;;;Well in my last post I said I would hate for the screen to get scratched, and its happened. Don't know how, as I was as careful as possible. I've ordered some screen protectors and a rubber/leather case for it. I checked back on some reviews and they say that the screen is ""scratch prone"". The scratch isn't really noticeable unless I tilt it into the light. I'm quite disappointed that it got scratched so easily. I've read about some polish called Displex, does anyone know if it will work on this phone?;;;;;I've had the TG01 for about 2 months and must say it's a great device. The initial experience with Windows Mobile 6.1 and the Toshiba UI was certainly not impressive: there's not a single trace of usability in Toshiba's home screen. Fortunately, a few weeks ago I got a notice from Orange Romania, telling me I can upgrade to Windows Mobile 6.5 for free. And that changed everything! The new OS is absolutely lovely and, with a few customization apps (I recommend Home Screen Customizer from the Windows Marketplace) , I got exactly what I was expecting: a responsive and customizable phone. Oh, and something really annoying: the camera has no flash and I didn't find a way to turn the shutter sound off.  All in all: great job, Toshiba (and Microsoft for delivering a more than decent mobile OS - at last!);;;;;There seems to be a renewed interest in Tg01 & i am glad,too many wrote it off without giving it a chance of updates like they do with nokia etc..;;;;;Sorry taht was me last post,,thanks Carrick..;;;;;Ive used a few windows 6:1 smartfones and kept the app (cabs) will they work on tg01,,i think they should but what about windows 6:5 will the apps (cabs) work just the same..Thanks that would be great help.;;;;;I have just bought a mugen extended battery for my e72 it was for my e90 but sold it..They offer free shipping and come with good instructions on charging etc,,it was first used by AAS forum and decided on their reccommendation to use them..Very nice quality battery..heres link to toshiba tg01 batterys ;;;;;Going to buy this friday orange prepay,, i will give it a go and see how good it is.;;;;;Got this phone on Friday from the orange shop for £149 incl £10 credit. For this price its a real bargain. Everything works great; WiFi, GPS, Accelerometer, all of the windows programs... The only bad thing is that the battery lasts about 2 days at the most. An 8GB Toshiba brand MicroSDHC is included, so this phone really is a bargain! I think it would of been nice if Toshiba had given a pouch/case with the phone because I would hate for the beautiful 4.1"" screen to get scratched/damaged.;;;;;Can i unlock it from orange like using nemesis software suite,,would like to try the fone but hate orange.;;;;;The phone is excellent except for the part that battery life sucks... If you are too lucky it will last for a single day..

They reduce the price because it's not selling well. And it's not selling well because it's not very good!;;;;;I get 5000 yen;;;;;Happy with the phone, got the upgraded unit with win 6.5 installed (nice) with the much improved front end, came with office mobile editor, orange maps, and a good set of apps, but navigation takes some getting used to but stick with it.  Dislikes:              	Battery life. Standby time at best is around 24 hours, talk time around 1 hour,( I set my phone to power saving).                 	Manual is on a CD and is for win 6.1 so the navigation/functions do not match Ive complain to Orange about the phones microphone, when talking to someone they complain that they cannot hear me, that included the support chap, it was so bad he rang me back on the land line.  Orange sending out a new unit, so Ill see if the battery life (or lack off) and the microphone are just a flukes. Ill let u know......       ;;;;;Hi. I have had a TG-01 for 3 weeks and after 2 weeks i put it up for sale. But, i came across a software upgrade to 6.5 and i honestly tell you... it feels like a different phone. It changes everything: poor sound, crashes, restarts, everything. I love it now, i really do.;;;;;When I bought this phone it was shipped with Windows mobile 6.1. This appears to be the cause of lots of crashing and freeze ups and frequent self re-booting, as the upgrade to 6.5 solves all these at a stroke.;;;;;I use this phone But this is bigger I drop it frequently;;;;;Just bought this phone on orange 2 days ago, bec. I lost my iphone on new years eve and i thought at £149.00 its quite a bargain..but man i was wrong...it crashes a lot..the interface is stupid...I am not an iphone fan.. but this wont go close in terms of being user friendly...;;;;;Orange have just reduced the pay as you go price from £399 to £149  so it must be selling badly.;;;;;ok this is my third tgii phone ta i have to had exchange bcz of sond and freezingproblems and more  and i cancel the  contract;;;;;Its a great phone, using it for a week and no problems, a few lags but trust me most phones are way worse if u are looking for something great looking, and fast, this is for u, if u want a 12 meg cam, search elsewhere, the windows works smooth and i have no complaints;;;;;can you help me upgrade my romanian tg01 to winmo6.5?

Make it the first thing you check out of the box.;;;;;I am get this phone 5000yen;;;;;j couldn't install 6.5, how did prevarant manage to install. prevarant pls explain...bgd;;;;;Me again, 2nd replacement has same fault thats 3 phones from orange. The most important thing here is to test the phone by listening to the call quality for 2 or 3 minutes as soon as you get it. Must be from the other phone in the call not the tg01 which will sound ok. That way you can send it back within the 7 day return clause and you won't have the same wonderful experience as me. You'll never know how much grief I just saved you if you're in the market for a phone with a big screen.;;;;;The banging is present on the replacement too, Orange please test the goods before you dispatch them for the same fault as you are aiming at resolving.;;;;;How many people have had the problem with weird banging noises on the line heard only by the person on the other end? I currently have this issue and am waiting for a replacement from Orange. Can I be so bold as to speculate that it may be an issue with the mike circuit picking up spurious signals. Its not audible to the TG01 user. Have you had comments like ""Have you got the builders in?"". Threads of similar cases in forums have not been resolved at time of writing this. Is it just my phone or is it a more popular fault? Big screen good, UI not that good, plug in a usb keyboard good,plug in a usb 4 port hub with a mouse good,call quality ok/banging noise bad, camera unable to take photos unless in bright light bad, processor good, screen response not as good as iphone, delay for camera start bad. The other 5 orange phones at the same location do not register the noise of carpenters in the background. I would like this to be a settings tweak solution easily fixing it because I really like the big screen. Could have been really good. Nothe 6.5 upgrade didn't fix the banging issue unless a later release addresses it.;;;;;great phone,update to 6.5,install srs wow hd,end it is what should it be;;;;;Seems to be Euro 350, comes out around INR 22,000. But it is probably not available in India.;;;;;hello everybody; i live in germany, and i wanna buy toshiba tg01. according to my search toshiba tg01 has some problems about virus and software,is it true or not? do you suggest this pda to me? i am looking forward to your replying. thanks a lot.;;;;;l0l, watch this, it's an extended version =)))) ;;;;;can wait to get 1;;;;;exotic ui ;;;;;resistive screen?? c'mon... no way. when they change it to capacitive I will think about it...;;;;;I have this phone for quite some time now (bought from Orange RO), and I still find it very impressive and usefull. With it's big screen, good touchscreen and fast processor even some iPhone users get impressed by this one. I didn't like the menu and for that I've installed SPB Shell 3.5 - now it looks more 'business' type, and it's also more practical. If you want some sound improvements install SRS WOW HD (you can find a special version for it on google). I heard that some larger batteries (from 1500 to 3500 mAh) will be available soon and with these some larger back covers where you can store the stylus. Overall it's a very good phone with good quality-price ratio.;;;;;Ive had the Toshiba TG01 (UK) since August now and i was very impressed by the looks and functions. It started to go operate really slow after a few months but i've upgraded to Windows 6.5 and its amazing, youtube is soooo smooth. it looks/operates more business like and im just amazed in general. I have got it in black with a black case. If you guys know anywhere where i can get a white case from pleaseeeee let me know, it would make my phone complete i think. Thank you p.s. its better than the iphone;;;;;I just want to know if i can use this phone unlocked here in america. I live in Indiana. I want to buy this phone and I have the money. I hate my iphone. But i don't want to buy this if it is not going to work;;;;;one day. but i love it.;;;;;hi green victor,  in tokyo you can get TG01 (aka T-01A)for around 45,000 yen unused..this is from they call shirom online shop or actual shop in akihabara.. unfortunately, T-01A is not unlockable as of now.. Only docomo sim will work..;;;;;with updated version Windows mobile 6.5, TG01 is a sure winner.. I am using unlocked France Orange TG01 and with WinMo 6.5, very fast, very responsive, multifuntional, multitasking, and watching video including youtube is a  great pleasure.. I do also have iphone 3GS, and samsung omnia HD, but each one of them is a winner. Want to keep them all.. ;;;;;the postings re battery life are far from good 1000mah hours now that's worse than the 3gsiphone i wont be getting one ...i would have except as i would have to be recharging the phone more than using the damed phone as for the iphone3gs oh igot one and its equally usless  needs charging every day & night totally a dead weight is there nobody with a brain making these products as if then device needs extra power ..ie extra mahr""s  put a stronger battery in the devices the best iphone battery is the 2g iphone which my partner gets 5 days of actual use of iphone;;;;;how come this phone come with German language? can somebody please show me how to change it back to English thank you ;;;;;Does it have voice recognition for bluetooth??;;;;;4 hour max;;;;;4 hour max;;;;;i'd would like to know, if when you use the phone with all this features, how long the battery holds?;;;;;I want to Unlock Toshiba TG01.It is locked to Orange UK. Can you please suggest me a good website where I can get the code??;;;;;I which country this phone had manufacture thank you ;;;;;I commented about this phone previously and mentioned the HTC Leo now HTC HD2. Now that is what a phone should be like. HTC has the Sense UI, form the review you would never know its a WinMo phone becos of the Customisation. HTC completely gutted the WinMo OS.If Toshiba are serious about competing we would know from TG02 rumoured to be on the way by yearend. Making a phone isn't all aboutthe processor like Toshiba positioned the TG01, its about your ability to personalise any gadget you have and tthe gadget being intuitive. The only reason why iphone and the ipod are so popular is down to that.So if you are making aphone with a scrap OS as WinMo you have to put in a extra effort to make it apealing. If not you are kidding. From having a look at reviews of HTC HD2 you can see that HTC put in a lot of effort into modifying the OS. I am due for an upgrade in January, so HTC hd2 is looking like my next phone. ;;;;;When 4.5 screen size ?;;;;;Hi Chris, Where did u buy the phone and whats the price? i want to buy one. Thanks;;;;;god speed;;;;;had phone for a week now and it is good, a small computer (lge mobile). Well worth it, no problems yet, easy to use, looks good, screen impresses everyone.;;;;;Toshiba need to do more about this phone. Thank God Competition is coming with other large screen phones most running on 1Ghz CPU. HTC Leo, Archos Android phone & LG BL40. HT are the best at customising the WinMo OS.I hope Toshiba would wkae up with improvement to TG02 ie 3.5 mm audio jack, better customised UI not the appalling STRIPES,better battery power.;;;;;too fast and too good for a WinMo device, throw in a 5MB camera with xenon flash / Maemo OS software (or similar linux based (way faster) get a battery of about 1500-2000 mA and you have a winner. Due large screen/fast processor combo, battery will need some heavy backup In rest kudos for use of snapdragon processor .;;;;;He is very Big! compared with Iphone!;;;;;The iphone 3GS battery life is also appalling. I had the N97 before that, this also has terrible battery life especially if you use the online widget features. Before that I had the Xperia which had brilliant battery life and is an all round brilliant handset. The only problem with that is the terrible Windows OS. I doubt that Bill Gates uses a device running Windows OS otherwise he would have sorted it out by now. So many great devices let down by this terrible software. I love the iphone as it is very fast and looks great and stuff. But the battery life is the only real complaint that I have about it. ;;;;;review please;;;;;Whoa!!! 4.1 inch screen? I'm gonna get one.;;;;;Can anybody tell me what is the price?;;;;;very Big Dislay.....(4.1 inch) very Good & Fast CPU...(1 GHz) very Good os............( w - 6.1 & 6.5) but....but.....but.....but....but....but... The Battery is a shame.....realy a shame..for Toshiba. only 1000 mAh....only what a joke.....;;;;;Baaler set, chater set............;;;;;Fortunately you can turn it off because standard main screen is hopeless. It looks nice on photos but it's unusable.;;;;;minuses: - battery (2-3h when watching films; ~8 on wifi; normally it works 2-3 days for me) - lack of standard buttons (""cross"", ""ok"") ;/ (honestly...it's problem only if you really need them - ex for games) - nearly all phones have power button on top - it has on left side; stupid for me - camera without ""flash"" (in htc it was usable sometimes) pluses: - very fast (comparing to htc touch pro; I can watch movie in full resolution from sd card; menu works without delays, etc) - very good screen - great colors, fully readable in sun; great resolution - despite big screen it's thin and comfortable to carry - everything I forget to write here ;p
 
btw 
google maps looks fantastic on it :);;;;;strange interface;;;;;nice device. even with their virtual pad i miss having a real one.. hope the add-on of a keybord or mouse would take of that.  isnt much faster booting up but once in it,....u feel the difference. and hopefully with the new winmo 6.5 will get a bit better. HATE  the interface. changed it to spb shell. and no battery life. 2-3 hrs max. need a bigger one. some guys are making a 2000mah....which should cure that. didnt manage yet to install a fully gps softare that runs.overall nice little device.with the right software will really shine. (try rrince of persia? hd) and by the way...u can zoom in and out by using the buttons as the strip isnt all that responsive ;;;;;whoa big screen batery life sucks ;;;;;I was really going to go for this phone but changed my mind. There is no 3.5mm audio jack, battery is crap at 1000mAH even my Nokia E71 has a 1500mAH with the same thickness.The major problem with this phone is the minimal effort at customising the User Interface. The phone was positioned to compete with the Iphone but if this what Toshiba have to compete in that segment then they must be a JOKE. For the records I am not an iphone freak but I think the guys at Apple have raised the bar in the cell phone sector as you can see Microsoft are 'TYRING' to wake up from their slumber ie their archaic OS WinMo 6.1 & numerous delays to updates. I really want a widescreen phone minimum of 4 inches so there are some coming to the market soon - LG BL40 & HTC Leo.I am really looking forward to the Leo as HTC are the best at customising the UI with TouchFlo followed by Samsung. ;;;;;Toshiba ?   Only G900  With wm6.5;;;;;just wanna warm you guys about this mobile the battery life sucks sooooo Bad it's that Bad really bad bad bad it sucks the life out of the battery within Hours don't use cam don't use the full features it sucks it ;;;;;well its a good looking but the screen is just too big for mobile device. if you get bored just hang it on wall doubles up as 32inch widescreen tv. not slagging it off. but too big for a pocket. more a briefcase phone. going back to old days with brick phones. shame. toshiba. ;;;;;Battery is rubbish!!;;;;;They are not really new, look at their oldest devices.;;;;;Lol, what do you want from the first 1GHZ mobile phone, with 4.1 inch WVGA screen??? This phone is nothing compared to their new unannounced devices, the TG02 is waterproof, has the same processor, same screen, 5MP camera, the Tg03 is also a great device, I wrote about these new mobile phones, go to the third page I think there are those infos(If you don't know about them) The problem is why they don't announce them? I am sorry they don't add camera flash. :( ;;;;;I don't now about this handset. But product's price are so high. It's true that every product of Toshiba are so high priced.;;;;;I don't now about this handset. But product's price are so high. It's true that every product of Toshiba are so high priced.;;;;;this phone is amazing 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11;;;;;snap dragon run very good but stripe is slowly software;;;;;toshiba tg01 looking cool :) and beautifull - now windows mobile is best  os >> and  toshiba tg01 1ghz processor >> the faster mobile >>  i like toshiba tg01;;;;; sorry friends it is TFT resistive touchscreen sorry  ;;;;;@@MIR  capacitive touchscreen ?? is resistive !;;;;;it's resistive touch screen;;;;;They should have put a 12MP camera with hd video recording and android,radio and that would be the best phone ever.;;;;;I'm so happy that I got Toshiba TG01 Windows Mobile... I love my capacitive touchscreen on Toshiba TG01  I love even more. more Microsoft! Toshiba TG01;;;;;Toshiba TG01 it is very great for this mobile.I would be say this  functions this mobile very easily.that is very good looking handset.,,;;;;;Toshiba's phone section sucks! Like HD-DVD!;;;;;WinMo 6.1? Small battery? No OLED? What a joke!;;;;;I go to buy it, I have many reasons one of them its taht is 2times powerfull than the other top10 phones whih its 1Ghz its fastter than enyone, and it have all the new twcnology in conectivity and perfotmance, it only have 2 things that i don't like: the camera and the plasticks colors of the phone;;;;;still waiting for nVidia Tegra based PDA... got built-in HDMI... ;;;;;WM6.1? Go to waste;;;;;Kurt toshiba is better then samsung and htc  , when you use this phone,  you will know about toshiba  TG01  :) and toshiba mobiles is new in market  ;;;;;Hoping to get this 'phone'? Think again. * Uncomfortable to hold, I also had problems using the blasted thing. * Windows Mobile, it's unresponsive, 1GHz processor? Big whoop, processor isn't everything, it's about the god, damn, RAM. GET IT RIGHT MANUFACTURERS * It's big, try putting it in your pocket, it's uncomfortable and fragile, I almost broke the demo version I was shown. If I can't put a phone in a place that's convenient then there's something wrong. I'm not using a bag just to put my phone in. As I said, think again.;;;;;i want to know how u installed d tf3d.... And does d fone hav a secondary camera?????;;;;;I was really looking forward to this devise but that expectation is dampened now. There are quiet some 1GHz processor smartphones coming to the market soon. The Sony Ericson Xperia 2 ( 4'screen, android os, capacitive screen & 3.5mm audio jack), rumoured HTC Leo ( 4.3'screen, WinMo 6.5,capacitive screen & 3.5mm jack), LG BL40 & Archos andriod phone ( 5' screen). Toshiba didn't do anything about customising the UI, take a look at HTC & Samsung WinMo phone , you would hardly know they are WinMo phones because the the good job done at customizing the UI. I presently use a Nokia E71 and it has a 1500mAH battery but alaso tg01 with a far bigger size has a 1000mAH battery, what crap, and then the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack messes up everything. Rumours say TG02 is scheduled for Q4 2009 maybe Toshiba would have learnt by then. Apple have definitely set the standards high with the Iphone and annual updates.;;;;;would be interesting to get HTC hero interface on :);;;;;Samsung OmniaPRO is agreat choice too...;;;;;this phone is nonsense, so what if it got 1 GHz processor? According to reviews its no difference plus its big & ugly so Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO, here i come baby cause right now your the best windows mobile coming out (well not counting some HTC devices)!!! YIPPY!!!;;;;;Had a look and a demo of the phone at the weekend and i must say what a load of rubbish its HUGE and uncomfortable to hold and ugly aswell. Not only that but the OS is slow and at times unresponsive. Stay away from it trust me;;;;;very nice phone with 1 ghz CPU...wow;;;;;I was hoping that this type of power would settle speed arguments about lag but every report ive read so far says its bad ..I was going to get g910 as its good looker with good spec and had high hopes but its terrible in use..Maybe toshiba need a third party to help them??? Just because you put a big engine in a car it does not make it the best,,its all the other components that come together to make it a good car..;;;;;Got mine today, toshiba UI sucks balls. Ditched it and installed HTC TF3D, and an SPB alternative. Phone is fast and responsive. Battery life seems good. GPS reception is amazing, 7 sats in view indoors, my touch diamond couldn't get 1. Orientation transition isn't fast but more like 2s than 4s. Screen looks great. If you can live with the size (i can, and quite like it) i would recomend this phone. One down side is nowhere to put the included stylus, though finger operation is ok, even with large hands.;;;;;I have been looking forward to the phone since Feb when it was announced but I also knew it was a dissapointment not disaster waiting to happen as i think Toshiba can fix the problems. The first thing was the battery, only toshiba beleived that was ok was a device with 1 gHZ processor, it was as if the processor would solve all  problems. You can hardly know the device has a processor that huge with its reacion time - the accerlerometer takes 4 sec to reorientate, IPHONE 3GSS with 600MHZ takes 1 sec. The 2nd problem is the lack of a 3.5mm jack , the adapter is just rubbish. From all the reviews I have seen so far, its not to encouraging, i pity the people who have bought this device now. I wonder why people rush and purchase devices before even hearing what the review is ????. I am due to get a new phone but i will wait until the right one is out . I want somethng with a large screen & Windows Mobile, so I guess I would wait until WinMo 6.5 is out in Sept, Samsung Omnia II is looking good, so if Toshiba can't fix TG01 by January then I am a Samsung phone user. I have seen WinMo 6.5 demo on Youtube and it looks impressive. Seroiusly Toshiba get your acts together, the hype for this phone was too much compared to what it can deliver.;;;;;You need help if you can't read that post. You go and use Google.;;;;;It was a friend, and we had a good chat. I also gave a technical talk to a couple of his colleagues on how to pitch the device better and divert customers away from the niggles. They appreciated my time with them.  However Orange HQ had asked the store to give detailed feedback on the popularity of the device and how many people enquired and ordered the device. Since Monday of that week only one person had phoned to ask about the TG01. Most consumers ignored it. Nobody had asked for a demo all week. ;;;;;I work at orange and it must have been annoying having a customer demo a phone for an hour and not buy it!;;;;;It's Interesting that the Toshiba TG01 only has two buttons on the front - the home and the back buttons - and they look capacitative at that. The dial and hang-up buttons are implemented within the soft key area which is new in a WM device. Share your views at   the site is only for TG01 users.;;;;;Used this in an orange store comprehensively for 1hour. Borrowed 3GS to compare. Still to try HTC touch pro2.  The TG01 was not as tight an experience as 3GS. but battery life despite 1100mah battery was more robust to use.the interface does not hide WM6.1 well and is rather slow and laggy. You must do gestures slowly. The 3GS was nippier in use and more responsive and the screen was superior for typing. The TG01 required more effort and I was far less accurate. Landscape is perfect on the 3GS for typing messages. Portrait is necessary for the TG01 due to the space bar disappearing into a small button in landscape.  This however is a far superior multimedia device for vid watching. In-app performance is stellar and battery lasts longer than 3GS and the screen is beautiful. However as a business phone the 3GS will be better as an emailer due to a more responsive and accurate keyboard.  Navigation is handled equally well on both devices.  It is also highly pocketable due to its thickness.  In short - 3GS crippled by battery life. TG01 just feels sluggish with its UI (like xperia1), but in-app performance is great and battery stronger than 3GS. Hoping HTC touch pro2 or omniaII will be better...all the devices are sadly flawed.  ;;;;;im sure this wont get much credit, from its battery info, i think it will not give much satisfaction to the end user, there will always be battery problem.;;;;;Dude your english is worse that the phone. No one can understand what you have written. Get help from Google;;;;;i'm gonna wait for a couple months to see what actual users have to say about it, as far as cameras go my Xperia X1 only has 3.2MP cam but quality is awsome better than some 5MP phones, mega pixels aint all that make a quality picture they just make the size of it! when are people gonna learn, lol;;;;;it was to me the phone to wait for but in toshibas email. it all was good but the down side for me was the camera only 3.15. but it has today been launched to orange . contact only. thats no good it needs to be sim free i will have to wait yet again alanf biringham uk;;;;;thing is i noticed the poor response times etc... with my x1 until i customised the UI and now it's super sweet, same problem with most winmo devices;;;;;Great looking phone with a terrible UI, in terms of responsiveness. It is slugging and the real 1-3 seconds pauses when thumping on icons makes one think there is a 320mhz chip rather than mighty 1000mhz snapdragon. I though the handset I tried might be a dud, so I tried another - sadly the same. A real shame. ;;;;;where can you buy this device sim-free at the moment, and have orange got it in stock for contracts?;;;;;Its a speed demon: SNAPDRAGON: 1GHZ = 2100 MIPS Samsung Omnia: 624﻿ MHZ = 800 MIPS Iphone 3GS: 600 MHZ = 1200+ MIPS INTEL ATOM: 1.6 GHZ = 3800+ MIPS for more info check out toshiba TG01 forums at tg01.

Hahaha;;;;;I hope that Toshiba learns from the imminent and inevitable failure of this device, and the successor will be a more pocketable device with capacitive touchscreen...;;;;;Well it would be best choice for me... But i'm driving car quite often. Do you know is there any acessories for the car like charger or holder. Thanks.;;;;;unless this device is very battery efficient with only a 1000mah battery.;;;;;That's Absolultely correct. I Totally Agree With You.;;;;;what an absolute bunch of whiners.... those of you that are all moaning about this phone having a WM OS should just get a flipping grip.  You don't like the phone, dont buy it.  Most people love Windows Mobile purely for the fact that they are comfortable with it and know their around it.  Everyone has their own tastes and each OS has its pros and cons but listening to some of you guys, makes me think that the majority here are just complete babies who like throwing their teddies out of the pram if they dont get their way. You want Android, there's plenty of phones that offer an Android OS, same goes for Symbian.  You want an iPhone, go and get one... ;;;;;I want this phone!  Can you say Android? Please Toshiba make a similar phone with the amazing android OS!;;;;;How large/serious software will be possible to install on TG01?;;;;;Impressive specification. Toshiba should launch with Windows 6.5.;;;;;This phone has a 1ghz snapdragon processor. In terms of power, it should put every other phone in the shade when released-can't wait!;;;;;ok! it doesn't have any stylus slot!!!!!!!! but it's a touchscreen phone and should have stylus. but where should i put the stylus????? in my pocket? like samsung omnia with no stylus slot... and it's a shame that it doesn""t have flash for camera. means that no chance for a good photo or film in the dark places.;;;;;No stylus slot (not needed in most circumstances due to large screen), no flash for camera.;;;;;i like it look so nice ;;;;;does this phone have any stylus slot? does it contain any flash for camera/;;;;;Any danger of someone either writing a comment in English? (grammatically correct would also be a huge plus...)   Looking forward to seeing this device to see if it's any real challenge to my HTC Touch HD - I am surprised that it's not going to ship with WM6.5 though - still, I'm assuming that it'll be a free upgrade within a very few months. Anyway...back to the illiterate childrens incredibly informed, articulate and razor sharp 'opinions';;;;;battery life sucks there;;;;;Look good with window mobile ...that mean outlook and skype can anyone tell me can TG01 could support Skype like my laptop? B berry could only up to Iskoot mora than that no good enough ...can anyone share your experince thanksss ;;;;;coz it's WinMo, sorry...;;;;;The CPU's speed of this cellphone is very interesting, but the size of the phone is too big.  It is so wide and it won't fit in the pocket.  I would rather like it with the smaller screen size such as 3.5 inch.;;;;;Battery looks like a problem. No radio, who cares? I dont. Hopefully will be good as it sounds.;;;;;Looking forward to the TG02 if the rumors are true.. . Water resistant - will look sweet on my MTB with memory map. But will buy this anyhow and upgrade later... .need a new one for work....bored of my blackberry now going back to winmo.;;;;;Weak multimedia side. 3,2Mpix??? No radio??? Windows lol It is obvious that Toshiba is unexperienced...;;;;;I have great news for Toshiba fans!!!!! I saw the next smartphones, the TG-02, TG-03, K1, K2 and L01 smartphones! The TG-02 has 4.1 inch WVGA screen, is waterproof, has 1 GHZ Procesor, 3.2 MP camera, Windows Mobile 6.5 The TG-03 will have Windows Mobile 6.5, 4.1 inch screen, 1 GHZ Processor, the camera will be 5 Megapixel(is true). The K1 will have QWERTY keypad, 1GHZ Procesor, 4.1 inch screen, Windows Mobile 6.5, 3.2 Megapixel camera. The K2 model will have 3.5 inch screen, 1 GHZ Procesor, 3.2 Megapixel cam.Windows Mobile 6.5. And the L01 is the most interesting phone, coz will have 7 inch screen, 1 GHZ Procesor, Windows Mobile 6.5!;;;;;I read from the makers of the snapdragon chip used in the TG01 is conpatible with both windows and linux OS which means you can install the Android OS on it if you don't like windows Mobile Pro 6.1 that comes with it. ;;;;;this fhone is super cooler than the samsung fg500;;;;;Hmm. Multimedia oriented and No RDS Radio? And only 1000 mAh to feed 1 GHz? Maybe even not a 3.5mm jack? Nice but it will probably be overpriced. I'm still going to get the small and fugly but feature packed Nokia E55/E52 instead. ;;;;;That may happen when they stop churning out handset after handset..They should concentrate on what public ask for and bring out handsets bugless as possible,,i think what your saying is you want good old style PDA functions with fone attached to send/recive info..I like the whole package but only nokia smartfones do that plus big video recording but far off from perfect.;;;;;You still have to keep in mind that windows mobile is more of a business type OS and not a media type OS with an eye candy GUI. However, I do agree with your opinion 100%. It seems as they make phones suited for their liking and not the consumers, but I guess they'll never take consumers' opinions and wants.;;;;;Yep, Windows Mobile is totally substandard. I dont know what bill gates is playing at. I think they all use Android at Windows so they havent figured out the problems with the software they create. Toshiba TG01, HTC Touch Pro 2 are all ruined by Windows. Nokia N97 is already looking dated as they are always behind the pack in these things. Samsung Omina HD is the most exciting phone out there but without the qwerty keyboard it is hard to beleive it will really suit the hardcore email/texters and users of office mobile, which includes me. I never really use my phone for calling, only for texts, emails, and internet browsing and mobile word for printing market notes. Therefore my options for a decent mobile to fulfill all these requirements is pretty limited. N97 or HTC Touch Pro really but I hate the Windows OS. Always hangs. So slow. So dull looking. I also find the resistive touchscreen sluggish. These mobile manufacturers really are not bringing any innovations to the market place now and more focussing on multimedia sets. Whereas there is a huge business mobile market. But it seems you cant have it all, style, substance, build quality, ease of use and full feature pack. When will they make a phone that does. And when will they make a touchscren phone that is really useable for texters and emailers and typers???;;;;;never;;;;;Agree 100%!!!!!;;;;;WinMo has got to be the most sluggish defunct piece of OS out there, just like their PC software, buggy and unreliable. It is a true shame to see all these beautiful and innovative phones going to waste because of such a terrible OS...;;;;;This phone just goes to show that even with a whopping 1ghz processor windows mobile can still ruin a device! WinMo=Failure;;;;;how much is this right now? waiting for response...;;;;;you can always count on a cab to be floating around ;);;;;;why dosen't have opera browseer :((((((;;;;;To me the phone looks beautiful but the user interface looks horrible.;;;;;Yea, it's wider but not thicker. Maybe it's wider because of the 4.1"" screen?;;;;;please can anybody tell me when it will be released in India. And what would be the prize. Please answer thanks in advance.;;;;;Dun u guys think it is kinda thick? Its slim but its going wider tho...;;;;;I would buy this today if it were available with network bands supporting the USA.;;;;;Be smart people. Rather than using Word, Excel and other Windows applications in to your laptop, you can use them in Windows OS phones. Be innovative, sleek and reliable. And to think of it, Toshiba TG01 had advantages: large 4.1"" screen, 1ghz processor and Windows OS. MobileMaster is right (see his message), Toshiba will release top-of-the-line devices.;;;;;good job Toshiba runs Window Mobile .Symbian OS is horrendouse;;;;;People be smart. Windows OS is recommended because of its Office applications. Rather than making documents or presentations using Word and PowerPoint, phones with Windows OS basically had it. By the way, this phone had 1 gigahertz of processor and 4.1"" LCD display, an advantage for Office transactions.;;;;;People be smart. Windows OS is recommended because of  its Office applications. By the way, this phone had 1 gigahertz of processor and 4.1"" LCD display, an advantage for Office transactions.;;;;;Have you ever tried any other OS besides Symbian? WinMo is undeniably one of the best OS on a touch-based mobile device. I think I know why you like Symbian so much. It's because it's simple, just like your mind. Here's an idea as to how you choose phones: ""Oh look, a Symbian OS phone, i'll get it, oh look 16 million color res. screen, i'll grab that too and oh look, this phone has so many ""good"" features which i will never learn to use but i like the sound of it so i'll get it too."" It's absolutely absurd to say that a WinMo device has BAD features, unless of course, you never manage to get your hands on one, or you did but you didn't know how to operate one. Your comment makes you look like a guy without brains. I feel sorry for you,sad little guy..;;;;;yeah WinMo is SUCK!! toshiba need open eyes on Symbian OS or they will waste much money because their smartphone is failed. Good Hardware but use Expensive OS with BAD Features [WinMo] LoL. Hope toshiba change WinMo to Symbian before release this Smartphone;;;;;and i think Google Android will be killed by Symbian Open Source :);;;;;Actually, it DOES record video and it DOES have a speakerphone. GSMarena should really update the specs, it's a little silly they leave it like this.;;;;;Hey Guys  No ,16 M Colors.:(  But good Processing Speed...1 Ghz ...oh my god...Like 1st Gen Comp/... Win Mo....Not happening...Would Prefer Android or Linux or atleast Symbian.....;;;;;could someone tell me how much does it download and upload cause it doesn t write and i don t know where ito find . pls tell me. thank you very much;;;;;NO VIDEO? NO SPEAKERPHONE? wtf!! 3.15 megapixels and no video?;;;;;Yes it will be dead by 2012 because it's the year of the apocalypse, so therefore everyone will be dead by then.  Do you realize how st**d this sounds? Windows mobile will be killed by google android OS by 2012? Same as linux killed windows OMG ROFL;;;;;Bro, this is a rumour, maybe is a lie, I don't know exactly!I like Windows Mobile too. I am a Sony Ericsson fan, and Sharp, coz is the most advanced on earth.;;;;;What cell phone service will this work on... i heard on any service. is that correct?;;;;;Guys is there any games for that ;;;;;Windows Mobile ending in 2012!?!?!? I dont think so... Win Mo is FAR superior to any other mobile OS on the market at present. I heard rumours that the entire world is going to end in 2012 but i dont think that is going to happen either.;;;;;pls pls tell me how much is hsdpa and hsupa. Pls tell me because i want to buy it. Thank you.;;;;;Does anybody know if it will be possible to install on TG01 such software as Mathematica or Maple?;;;;;Windows Mobile is good, but the Google Android is better, I heard rumours, that the Windows Mobile will be dead by 2012, but you can be sure of this thing. The Google Android OS is a new OS, the Windows Mobile is popular.;;;;;Hi my friends i want to know the problems of windows mobile because i have read some one proposing that the phone would be good if it would run android OS. I want your advices.;;;;;I have great news for Toshiba fans!!!!! I saw the next smartphones, the TG-02, TG-03, K1, K2 and L01 smartphones! The TG-02 has 4.1 inch WVGA screen, is waterproof, has 1 GHZ Procesor, 3.2 MP camera, Windows Mobile 6.5 The TG-03 will have Windows Mobile 6.5, 4.1 inch screen, 1 GHZ Processor, the camera will be 5 Megapixel(is true).

And the L01 is the most interesting phone, coz will have 7 inch screen, 1 GHZ Procesor, Windows Mobile 6.5! ;;;;;I'm glad you agree with the mega pixel statement, I agree with it too... everybody keeps complaining that cameras on phones are stuck at around the 3 mega pixel mark.. they think that somehow means a useless photo.. when what it really means is size of photo.. and a photo taken with a 3.5mp camera is all the size you are ever going to need or want really on a phone.. If you want more, but a dedicated camera becuase you are pbviously a professional photographer :) Cannot wait for this phone, very excited.. those sites doing a VS iphone against this make me laugh so loud.. how can you compare?? this is a Ferrari and an iphone is a mini cooper, there is nothing to compare, this beats it hands down, not even a contest to be had.. quit with the iphone comparisons.. it's getting very pathetic now.;;;;;Actually I agree with this about 2-3 mega pixels vs. 8 mega pixels few comments before. Anyway waiting for this phone a lot!;;;;;Toshiba should run Google Android OS on this device instead of Microsoft Windows CE.;;;;;what are you going to do with a camera on a phone that is say 8 mega pixels? for a start.. that would be images 2000x4000 in size.. far too big to view on a mobile screen or a monitor really.. far too big to be sending in a message or an email.. plus it takes up a massive amount of space on your phone.. most people take 1600x1200 which is a good size photo and that is about 2-3 mega pixels.. it can't be more than that, that's what it is.. people just don't understand what they are talking about. What some people don't understand is this.. they have a 12mp camera.. they take a photo with it that is 1600x1200.. that is not a 12mp photo.. that is only using 2-3 mega pixels.. ;;;;;The best mobile hardware so far, but how about making it in Android flavor? I have had very disheartening experience with Windows Mobile, and cannot wait to lose it for good. If this thing does not ship with Android or an option to install it, I will have to look elsewhere.;;;;;Didn't you hear? the TG01 won the BlackDot Compact design category award... lol!!! Lmao!!!!;;;;;It seems to be fantastic,the best ever constructed in the world of mobiles.Any way I'd like to know when will be in shops of greece and which will be the price.In order to estimate between object and price.;;;;;I'm so loving it, I'll buy it right after it's released;;;;;Lets no forget that most manufacturer still prefer to use resistive touchscreen because you can use hand writing recognition feature which will not work on capacitive touch screen since you cant use a stylus. In China they still prefer hand writing recognition.;;;;;my toshiba 911t with 3'' wvga screen and only 780mah battery keeps 3-4days and yes,it has video recording;;;;;good phone pity it does not have internal gps chipset and fm transmitter and a decent camera. otherwise i would buy it.;;;;;great phone with boring features;;;;;Will this phone be available in the Philippines?;;;;;1 GHz this guy is spanking hot FAST~ but I can't probably get one here XD, and I can't imagine the price~;;;;;the hardware is awesome but i cant say i feel good about the software features!!;;;;;no video,no second camera for videocall???? NO PHONE!!!;;;;;this has got to be the most sexiest fone i have ever seen;;;;;When it will be available in Dhaka, Bangladesh;;;;;When it will be available in Dhaka, Bangladesh;;;;;is anyone not annoyed that Toshiba hasn't tried to cover up the windows interface indeptly??? like the htc touch pro 2 etc, the 3 strip menu really isn't good enough cover if when you click on any application eg contacts it takes you back to old windows style!!!;;;;;Because you can't put it in your pocket?;;;;;Why don't you get a netbook instead. They are 8.9"". Way bigger this this 4.1.;;;;;where is da speaker???:(;;;;;Great fone, u will feel so pirty if u no have it ! I LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTT;;;;;Wow so who cares if it had a 4.1 screen but its a resistive touchscreen witch is nothing compared to a capacitive touch screen...capacitive screens are wayyyyy better i think alot of mobile phone brands should start making all their touch screen phones with a capacitive screen...then it would be worth spending ur money...and am sick of using styles's ;;;;;It's a monster phone, I like it, I hope that in the near future we will get Regza clamshell phones from Toshiba, like in JAPAN!!!;;;;;Doesn't anyone think that for this phone having such a big screen, on the demo videos, the guy found it hard to click on the tiny icon for the calender, time etc, whats the point of the big screen if you are gonna have hard to click icons!!!;;;;;Yeah, and this phone has video option too.(I think there is a mistake in specifications);;;;;even today's digital cams got video option;;;;;I dont understand why some people r complaining abt its 4.1' big Screen size... Only because it's not easy to operate single handedly? I got Nokia E90 with 4.0' Internal Screen...but with less width size...(wish the width is little more big too) I use surfing a lot...so for Me the Big Screen Size is more Important to watch the web-sites comfortably. I think Big Screen with High Resolution is always a Plus Point  If U r using Ur Phone for Mulimedia and Internet pUrpose. Ya the major minus points of this phone are no video 
Only 1000Mah Battery  
(it will be drained soon due to its Big Screen size);;;;;No matter all the noise made about a product most people wouldnot buy until they have read previews on websites like GSMARENA. Let us see if the battery power is sufficient, I have a Nokia e71 with excellent battery power and though this phone is going to combine a lo of functions, if the battery power isn't good it wouldn't be worth it. I think phone manufacturers should think more deeply and test their products before relaese and too much noise;;;;;think how many people buy i-phone when there better phones out this phone will take away i-pone sales cos it looks pretty simular.;;;;;Hi , This is very goooooood.;;;;;Whoa! Impressive specs! \ I don't mind if it's 2-3 mm thicker to accommodate 2000 mAH battery, 8 MP camera, 3D stereo speaker and  3.5"" jack. TV receiver/recorder, 3d gaming will also be nice.  I mean, 4.1"" display for standard winmo apps is just a waste. It should be a multimedia & gaming center with phone features not otherwise. I will consider buying this if they put above specs in the TG01.;;;;;there is no 3.5 mm earphone jack?!!;;;;;i think the spec on this site is not up to date as  Toshiba TG01 does have video and Secondary-Digital-Camera;;;;;Can anyone tell me what is so great about this device? Aside from the big screen (which btw makes the device to big for one handed operation)and the snapdragon processor, what are the other jaw-dropping specs? there are none!! On the other hand... -No video -No secondary camera  -Lame battery... I'm glad I got my Touch HD!!!;;;;;Resistive touch screen?  Why?;;;;;none of you guys ever take photos?;;;;;toshiba,upgrade the camera to 5mp and the battery to 2000mah;;;;;@ B_E_N um yes this supports video wtf. and how small are your hands exactly... this phone is beast besides camera basically;;;;;I read all specifications..and dude its awesome gadeget ever i seen .. i m dieing to get one in my hands...man its top opponent of Iphone..;;;;;Weaknesses: MS Operating Sys, Battery life inadequate (WHY only 1000?) and poor mega camera. OTHERWISE; nice!;;;;;""Fantastic"" ? It doesen't support video ( What !? ) , and only one cam. Great display, though - perhaps too great ? Really, do you want a thingie you can't hold with one hand beacause it's simply too large to be comfortable ? Might as well go for a netbook then. Seems like the Omnia HD will blow this one away...;;;;;no radio rds????;;;;;pl. tell some one price & availabilty of Toshiba TG01;;;;;Win OS is a disappointment.  The batter is not powerful enough by a long way. The camera at 3.1, is.... ok but given others coming on strong at 5,8 and 12, 3 seems pretty ho hum. On the plus side, I really like the size of the screen and thickness.  It has appeal but would be better if the above short comings were fixed.;;;;;fantastic...;;;;;It's very good but either pocket music software or graphic equalizer hopefuly for music lover;;;;;It looks ok but it's not quite as good as it should have been, compared to the Iphone i will still go for the Iphone, it should have atleast come with a flash for the camera, fm radio, but it's not a bad start, Toshiba should try harder if they want an Iphone killer, they should look at the samsung omnia for example.;;;;;i dont think its good idea, if toshiba make good laptop its dont mean the mobile phone is good.;;;;;ya i think itd nice but not good.;;;;;Can Toshiba make miracles? I mean... the TG01 has nice specs (not great, but nice) but how long will the 1000mAh battery last? Will you have to charge it once, twice or more times a day?? how much usage time can you pull out of such a weak battery???;;;;;I like that...............hummmm;;;;;TOSHIBA make great Laptop, Im sure they can make great phone and should be more of it. Imagine, every laptop sold come with mobile phone, that's great!;;;;;phone size is very big,battery life time is short,camera is not good,and 1 gig prossesor is very high for windows mobile 6.1!!!i like big LCD but i think my Touch HD is beter and user friendly than this phone.;;;;;good hardware, but no flash and the battery sucks for a smart phone;;;;;WOW, this phone is amazing, i cant wait to get my hands on one of these, not only is the screen bigger than my iPhone 3G but is also faster with a nice user interface!!! and touch screen navigation! The display looks pretty clear as well;;;;;Does anyone know if this phonne will be available on O2 in the UK or which networks will be supplying it?;;;;;1GHz ! now that's what i'm talking;;;;;Now this is sweet...want to see a snapdragon with android, 8mp+ cam with flash, 720p vid and this 4.1inch of lovelyness...;;;;;This phone is awesome..... 1 GHz.... 4.1"" screen.... 16 GB memory card.... Its like a Desktop computer of the 90's.... hehehhehe..... but with a battery of 1000mAh???????? hmmmmmm......... Anyhow.... Toshiba products is good... I mean very good... my LCD TV is toshiba, my ref. is toshiba even my current PDA phone is TOSHIBA G810 portege.... I love the features of the phone..... and I like it.... only thing.... the battery..... it dosnt last long... If I open all the features like wifi, blutooth, music and a couple of calls it will last only for 5 hours.... and the battery is already 1530mAh My only point is that they should must consider the battery life of this new model to attract more gaget maniacs out there to buy this phone....;;;;;1 GHz CPU in a telephon now the`s cool!!!;;;;;Good one!! Couln´t have said it better myself... In addition, for a device with such a big size, it should be loaded-crazy with stuff... I still think the Touch and Samsung Omnia HDs are better...;;;;;Only 3 MP camera? How bad, WinMo is a piece of crap, the UI from Toshiba is not industry standard, does it have PC sychronisation or any cool service or easy set up e.g. eMail that IPhone / Nokia / Samsung has? The price point of 599 Euro drives are you nuts? While you can get a 280 Euro for an excellent touch from Nokia or LG? Toshiba, nice technology demonstrator for the screen, slimness, but it is too wide, to badly spec'ed simply irrelevant. Sit down and do it again..;;;;;I know its slim and light...but it's still long and wide...I can't imagine putting this up against my face during a phone call...might as well be putting a laptop against my face...;;;;;this phone's interface is made around WinMo 6.1...wonder if it will still work on the new WinMo version?;;;;;I wonder how much time the battery lasts.A 1 GHz processor,4.1 TFT touchscreen and other things that drains the battery,only 1000 mAh???;;;;;Alex, you are not the only one... 1 Ghz is really good, both for the device and in terms of the market standards :)));;;;;I found some online prices, probably fake, but could give you a idea of what your in for.  = $999  = $1049  = $799;;;;;this model can erase the Sonyericsson Xperia X1 from the track good jop TOSHIBA ;;;;;Might as well just put a sim card in a laptop!;;;;;Why this phone is comming into the list of GSMArena when I am searching for a phone without camera? Is this model have a business version, which have no camera? If anyone have any idea then plz let me know..;;;;;can someone post a review of this phone or a link ? i am serious , i want to buy it :);;;;;Nice to finally see a PDA phone that has a screen as large as 4.1 inches. I presently own a hp ipaq with a 4 inches screen and have been looking forward to a phone that would have a wide screen as my present device. This toshiba product looks promising the only surprise was what i read that it doesn't come with a 3.5 mm earphone jack ?? I want to believe that is untrue because if it is actually true then toshiba would be the greatest fool of them all, please Gsnarena guys please confirm it is not true ??????;;;;;They havent invented pockets big enough for this...;;;;;This phone does record videos.;;;;;This is a big step in the mobile phone industry... A 1ghz processor on a phone wooow...  My netbook currently runs at 400mhz. CONGRETULATION TOSHIBA!!!;;;;;It's just another Windows Mobile device in disguise...;;;;;Its a good device but lack of video recording is a big minus.;;;;;This is what companies should be doing instead of sacrificing the features of the phone and making the os slimmer they should be upping the specs.;;;;;I think that the deciding factor for high-end phones like this is, the price.;;;;;cant wait for it to be released;;;;;1 GHz and a screen that big ... what about battery ? This will eat a lot of battery even in standby mode + winmo is one of worst solutions (even the new Symbian s60v5 that lacks some stuff is way better) ... At this specifications they could put Windows XP (you could play games like GTA or NFS :)  );;;;;where is 2nd camera? RAM? HTC touch hd is much better;;;;;I have followed closely all the comments about phones mostly the smartphone.  Come to think of it, we still have some computers that have 450Mhz in our homes.  That Toshiba is 1Ghz with huge screen. Really there may not be a perfect phone out there but we are seeing a great trend in the market.  However, there is a phone for everyone,  There are people still having a black and white TV set in their homes.  What about that. 

;;;;;with only 256K colors,a traditional LCD display, and a 3.2 MP camera this phone adds no real value to the arena--the only specification that might save it from being obsolete before hitting the shelves would be a very long battery life(>7hrs video playback)   --the OQO2+ offers more computing power, larger and better screen--technically however it is a mini-computer;;;;;battery is very important... hope it'd have a powerful battery.;;;;;Really like the look of this phone, hope it comes to t-mobile USA;;;;;nice looking phones chaps;;;;;Why is it I am the only one that is exited about the first 1 GHz processor in a handheld ?!?;;;;;just because u dont take pictures dont mean others dont. u hav 2 consider overall not just yourself. for your phone, its fine but people ask for more and more. nokia's processor speed is ok for day to day running as well. im not talking about first generation of n series or whatever, im talkin about n95 8gb etc.;;;;;Ive got an iphone and ive got video recording on mine, very high quality too. Im glad apple didnt make video recording for it because no doubt it would have been terrible quality. The video recording I have pretty much takes photos very rapidly at the iphones cam resolution, making the quality good. It doesnt compress the files either so it doesnt turn out like a crappy 3gp file. Ahh how i love the jailbreak. As for the iphone speed, mines slow because of all the crap ive got on it and jailbreaking with themes etc. Once i restore it and rejailbreak its great. This phone will completely kill it though, the iphone is no match to it processor wise, to use it as a proper phone every day and i think the iphone wins. Its a good achievment though, well done to toshiba;;;;;This is a big step in the mobile phone industry..a 1ghz processor on a phone wow.. my netbook currently runs at 1.6ghz (though i overclock to 2ghz). The phone itself..not so great, I couldnt see myself lugging around a brick that wont fit in my pocket. Sure its thin, but i would much rather had a thicker phone than a wide and tall phone that wont fit in a pocket. Its a great step in the right direction though, this should mean that other big companies can start producing something like this with a better phone. Until then im happy with my iphone;;;;; i like it buy it will  ;;;;;If you spend so much money for this, the co. should add FM, Video recording.  Also it can provide DUAL SIM technology.;;;;;at least the camera is better than iphone n iphone doesnt hav video so wht r u talkin about? iphone users bragging on about the cpu speed but nw this one is way faster n u call it suck? ;;;;;y cant ppl take user opinions and put them to use ... WinMo sux .. get that and UI isnt that great ... and battery life .. 1 day !!! seriously ... wake up;;;;;no fm radio?;;;;;toshiba is making a simliar phone like th Iphone. suck ass camera and no video!!! wtfff;;;;;winmo *snore* already lost me UI is also ugly as heck;;;;;i want to know how long the battery life will last.. .why isn't it listed? ;;;;;cont. Id rather prefer ;;;;;Nice try esp the screen but i guess its too big, i mean 3.5inch was bulky enough, this wouldnt really fit in a jeans front pocket. Id rather prefer ;;;;;this is one of the most awesome gadget....I love to have one guess lot more better than iphone....;;;;;wheres the 3.5mm Audio Jack ???? :(;;;;;i like this phone a lot. the processing power is outstanding. the design is v appealing (kinda like ipod touch). the resolution is fantastic. however there r a few reasons y u shudnt buy this phone: -no video recording. (y? 1st iphone, then htc g1, then palm pre and now tg01. do manufacturers think that video recording is no longer needed on smartphones?) -no 3.5mm jack (wud hv been nice cos this wud hv made a nice video and music player) -65k effective colors (yes winmo doesnt support more bcos they say they need a faster processor.   more color wud hv been much better cos it has a nice screen size and gud resolution - especially for watching videos) -pressure sensitive touchscreen (used on almost every winmo device. this was rly a bad choice by toshiba tho. pressure sensitive touchscreen need to hv a flexible layer of plastic which means u dont get a v durable screen. it is not as responsive as capacitive touchscreen (eg: iphone, g1, palm pre) or optical touchscreen (neonode). also pressure sensitive uses several layers which make the image quality of the screen worse.);;;;;this phone is almost perfect... amazing...;;;;;great device, but dimensions... definitelly too big for me.  we call it ""brick"" here in Poland :D;;;;;poor of you,my PC is 3 GHZ and still havin lagging problems! XD;;;;;Yes,its resistive touchscreen,maybe ship with one as Toshiba says!;;;;;256 mb of RAM and 512 mb of ROM;;;;;To those of you who make negative judgements, didn't your parents ever teach you not to judge the book by its cover? You don't even have the phone yet in your hands, and besides, its not going to be released until the 2nd quarter of 2009, and you make nasty judgements about this phone? This phone has not even been released yet...Man you guys should know better than to judge a phone that has not even been officially released. Why don't you guys sit back, relax, enjoy what you have right now, and, make judgements if and when you already have tested this phone, ayt...Chill out.;;;;;Wow!!!! This is awesome!!! 1GHz!!! But tooooo big!!! Any way, Toshiba has done a great job, this beats Touch HD in everything(except camera). Well done Toshiba!!!!;;;;;sucks!!! very difficult to carry its to wide!!;;;;;waw, 1 GHz !!!  My Computer is 933 MHz.;;;;;Does it have a stylus?;;;;;What about RAM memory ? It is 128 RAM or 256 RAM ?;;;;;The display theme is soooo poor.......comparing wiv Iphone 3g & HTC TouchHD;;;;;You don't prefer a phone to another for just its colors..;;;;;Wow!!!this is the great phone,WinMo OS 6.1 and 1 GH processer, wide screen size 4.1 inch, I am waiting to buy when it is available Cambodia but the price should be less than $350. I am the owner O2 Atom Exec it is great too, but the sreen size only 2.7 inch not big enought for mobile internet browser reading.;;;;;i like big display 4.1 inch , bad camera 3.2 mpix why no video recording ;;;;;This device were awesome..within this short 2 years time, mobile world change drastically. Device maker push themself hard for this.Especially who came up with touch screen UI technology... =);;;;;well its ture that more processing power means higher power consumption but i think ur forgetting the fact that the highest processing might be only required at times when ur doing some thing like watching a video at D1 resolution and that too will require around half of the processing this beast has to offer.last but not the least the normal processing required(like basic stuff) for a divice powered by wince is very low.....;;;;;the bad thing about slim phone is that the speaker and vibration are weak weak!!!!!!!!! PDA phones have sucky camera!!!;;;;;winmo is smart os. if u r not smart enough, u can't be amused when using it . so go for easy-to-use UIs . thats all. ;;;;;maybe they'll put a lithium polimer battery in it so that it lasts longer;;;;;1 Ghz prosseser holy crap this thing is making the iphone look like a t-mobile phone...exept for no video...and i guess moderate camera..... :-(;;;;;It's too big .... almost like carrying around a small netbook.;;;;;isnt is 480x 800 pixels cause u said 800x400?;;;;;I bought a G900 when it came out to the market. Like this one, it was the best. Sold it before the first month, TOSHIBA never again. They not even test the phones before launch. Thats why they always ara first.;;;;;The battery can't last long due to 1 GHz processor (higher frequency, higher power consumption, high heat). The screen and size of phone is too big to be kept comfortably in hand, strange and embarrassing for a cell phone used daily. The success of screen stands in its sensitivity to finger touch, that may be a success just with a capacitive screen as iPhone has versus most of WinMo equipped with plastic flexible screens, with low prediction to get the input and owing to flexible screen from plastic have a dull, opaque image.;;;;;1ghz processor!!!! omfg thats a lot;;;;;T-Mobile should carry this phone to up it's game and it is a serious Iphone contender;;;;;This phone only has 256K Colors, (iPhone 16 Million) which makes me not want to buy it.;;;;;I notice that one thing that people are concerned about is making movies with the camera. That can be handled at the software level. Another is Win Mo. I look at WM this way, most of the problems inherent with this OS can be fixed with the Extended Rom overlay from either the manufacturer or the carrier. By far Toshiba is showing that this is the case. The demo vids that I have seen have shown what Win Mo is capable of and so much more. What they add to the WM interface will determine how good this phone will be....;;;;;heavy battery eating monster. names as mini-netbook!!!!!;;;;;if you read carefully, here's a fun fact: one day battery life! enjoy!;;;;;wow! this fone looks good! i like the interface! Not a huge fan of WinMo. but i can deal with it. plus this is my answer to texting because i thought the iphone had a small screen... 4.1 should be more then enought for me to type on...ahaha  You Go Toshiba!;;;;;No, it doesn't kill the N97, the N97 is smaller in size (even if with smaller display, the mobile phone is intended to be small) has a 5MP camera with dual LED flash and autofocus, has a video call second camera, 32GB on board memory, 3.5mm headset connector..etc. So it doesn't kill the N97, it's just another solution besides the N97.;;;;;It's something like HTC that's all!;;;;;Great job Toshiba! I hope the price will be good.;;;;;it should be WM 6.5;;;;;ow my god,this one kills the N97!!!!!;;;;;awesome phone..  but no video recording?? and no flash?? not good...;;;;;awesome phone, but it seems a little large dont you think? i mean its thin and thats good but the height seems a little to long (and im judging this from the picture when its next to the iphone);;;;;No, that thing in the top is not the secondary camera, see here   No secondary camera, 3MP with no flash, really big size, not sure if this would work against its 1GHz processor & display. But at least, for sure, these would reduce its chance to be a flagship.;;;;;Size: 130 x 71 x 9.9 mm I wonder what they thought of when making a testing platform into an actual product... Its simply huge. For 4.1"" screen you need 1280x720p resolution, not 800x480. My humble opinion.;;;;;it seems to have a secondary camera and handwrite recognition (it should use a stylus)!;;;;;At last a GHZ phone and 3d UI !!!!! I'm so glad right now !                     :-))));;;;;Seems like an impressive device...yet there are a few things missing... no proximity sensor (auto turn-off), no handwriting recognition, no radio, no 5MP cam and no secondary video camera, no 3.5mm output jack... and IE?? Right...I´m sticking to Opera. So all in all it may be fast and have a large screen, but I´m sticking to the Touch HD. Just compare them and you´ll see...;;;;;nice. all i'm happy about is the 1gz processor. other than that. its okay. the screen is nice n big. but only 265k... eh. and trust me n97. rocks it out of its world. ;;;;;This phone is tooll!!! The whole 1 GHz the man, this phone only needs to four things, video recording, flash, 3g that can work in the U.S.A. and a instant messenger, Other than that this phone is tool.;;;;;really cool gadget .. perfect year start up .. only concern is UI .. let see .. :);;;;;I Ghz proccessor waoooooooooo!!!!!!!1;;;;;This is sweet.  Definitely a MID to watch out for.  Competition is getting stiffer and stiffer between these touchscreen phones.  The only thing that is sort of a turn off about this phone is winmo.  Android, Symbian, OSX, and lately Palm OS are the ones getting impressive attention, but we'll see how this one fares with all of them.  Nice, really nice.;;;;;If it was a tri-band WCDMA (3G) then this could kill the iPhone. As it is, it'll be on even footing.;;;;;HSUPA (L) waiting that feature in a nice-design HTC WVGA (L);;;;;Pity they left out a FM radio!!;;;;;Finally a phone to kill the junk iPhone. ;;;;;battery can barely last 24hours, however 1ghz processor is a huge compared to all other mobiles. I would still prefer touch hd;;;;;Toshiba please keep price reasonable acceptable to many in the world. Then u wil rock n beat HTC idiots who r unjustly keeping high price for their devices. Thanks in advance to one who convey this message to toshiba.;;;;;Looks like a funky little phone but it only has a 3mp camera!? with no flash. damn;;;;;really new years gift from toshiba.setting new standards in win mobile. thanks toshiba. i will do purchase one.;;;;;The battery can't last long due to 1 GHz processor (higher frequency, higher power consumption, high heat). The screen and size of phone is too big to be kept comfortably in hand, strange and embarrassing for a cell phone used daily. The success of screen stands in its sensitivity to finger touch, that may be a success just with a capacitive screen as iPhone has versus most of WinMo equipped with plastic flexible screens, with low prediction to get the input and owing to flexible screen from plastic have a dull, opaque image.;;;;;this is just awesome....out of the world...big time iphone killer... apple must b feeling shy now...infact nokia(5800,n97) n sony x1 too must b feeling shy haha..hope the price is good...rock on toshiba.;;;;;OMFG...!!! That's Lot!!;;;;;if this unit has 16M colors PLUS developers for iphone apps will also make apps for this phone.. Then this is definitely the iPhone killer. samsung, nokia and HTC killer as well =D;;;;;no not imperfect but important ...........  imperfect for nokia n96 260 mhz but toshiba 1000mhz....where nokia and where toshiba;;;;;very very impressive!;;;;;And no TV-Out ?!?!;;;;;oh no. wat marvelous specification. is this the n97 n X1 buster? It sure sounds attractive. I can't wait to see full specification n get my hands on it. (ADDITIONAL INFO: fone is really huge on the hands n pocket. one point down.);;;;;Who cares about camera on a phone.....i barely use that feature.....man this phone its a beast it might make the iphone run into cover....i agree though it should be android, but i think HTC have most of it;;;;;Awesome!;;;;;check this website ppl for the photos...njoy ;;;;;  Hands-on photos with more takes on the GUI of the OS!;;;;;Looks interesting, 1ghz proc, 4.1 "" screen :) .The camera looks like it will be only a 2-3 mpx fixed focus camera but I could live with it if it has a great interface :) , as great as it can get using WM.;;;;;camera?????????????;;;;;With a proper memory and battery... this thing would the best phone by far... it looks very big, not only the screen is freaking 4.1 !!! but there is a lot of not used space...;;;;;wondering how much will the battery last with that 1GHz....;;;;;ssaaawwwweeeeeeetttttt;;;;;OMG is very good but would be better with androyd;;;;;wow... an absolute beast... in regards to specs buh size hmmm... likin it very much tho ;-);;;;;wow great phone;;;;;why was this introduction so imperfect????;;;;;Great 1ghz .for you 100%.very good toshiba .but camera 3mp or 5mp;;;;;oh my god !;;;;;2nd! camera????;;;;;FIRST! omg,it looks rly gd :)","[datetime.date(2016, 2, 26), datetime.date(2014, 12, 7), datetime.date(2014, 5, 20), datetime.date(2014, 5,

A similar one , from another model because this is too old for a original one?;;;;;I want to change the language to English please.;;;;;How can i change d language to english?;;;;;before i bought this phone read some really nasty reviews about on here. but honestly after using it for a while its not bad at all. sure there's some things that could be better like the operating software, but honestly most windows mobile phones are complicated. the camera is really good, and even though the battery life isnt spectacular it still does the job.  it has some really amazing features though, if you connect it to the pc its so easy to copy any files that you need. it comes with microsoft office aswell and the media player is exceptional. the touchscreen is really trendy aswell. all in all it isnt a perfect phone, i dont think there is a perfect one out there. but you have to give it a 7.5/10 atleast and that for me means its a very good phone.;;;;;Radio sucks!!Too LOW!!!!;;;;;bopols!!!!!! just read the manual of your phone. ;;;;;how can i change the language of the phone into english..;;;;;nice;;;;;i agree with that.

The touch screen is not very responsive and the rubbish windows operating system is not only slow but also crashes very frequently.

I'm not technician but I have some ideas to you. First ensure that all buttons are in good condition : not pressed, especially on/off button. Secondly, it can be a moisture problem, in that cas you must turn off your mobile and dry it with hair dryer (in a cold position!). If it is not the case it could be a software problem, you should see a repairman.

I realized that the problem is not actually the installation, it installs correctly but the problem is that does not start. Someone told me that would be dedicated to work only with NAVILUX, but I have seen users on various forums that say they iGO works perfectly. It was like someone here on this site wrote that installed iGO and it works perfectly. If you know something about this problem please help me!!!;;;;;Hello Crys. What I can tell you is that I got original card with maps when I bought this phone. In manual (from iGO), it says that (backup reasons) it is neccessery to copy all files from original memory card to hard disc drive. But, when I copied that files (from hdd) to another memory card and put it inside phone I could not start NAVILUX (IGO) software. Maybe you should write to them at: ­  Greetings. Dusko;;;;;I tried to install igo on the device and fail. I copied IGO8 files on the memory card and inserted into the device when it asks me if I want to install i press ""yes"" and start installing. Loading bar installation until end once and this is it, nothing else. IGO icon appears in programs such as installed but when I start nothing happens. I tried different versions of IGO and all the same problem (i tried with miomaps same problem). I tried these versions of GPS on an Asus P320 and goes perfectly. (here, on Asus P320, are several steps installation not only one)  Does anyone know who would be the problem?  Please help!!!;;;;;Well, what can I say. I bought it for a song, half the price of HTC Cruise 09, and it has almost all the functions that I need.  Yah, if you use the phone for five minutes, like wifi, it gets slightly hot. But compared to my Motorola 3Vi, it is not as hot. Just a minor problem with slim phones. The touch screen is a bit less sensitive, so you need to put more pressure with the built in stylus, and you need to be precise as well. Battery life is OK if you are not continuously using 3g. Just imagine, if you were to design a phone that has that many functions, and squeezing it in a slim form like the 810, you will be very lucky to do it right. For Toshiba to make this 'SLIM BEAUTY' work as well as those from HTC and Nokia, they must be highly commended since they have not been a prolific like others. I installed the Garmin map and it worked wonderfully with very fast satellite locking. Maps are quite detailed and for once, GPS does worked as claimed.  I loved the form factor most. Just the right size. Slipping into and out of the pocket gives you a nice feeling, quite unlike those bulky Blackberries. However, the TOS 810 can't handle too many running programs simultaneously, so have unused programs properly closed. Can't blame it as it only has a 400 MHz processor. But then, its battery life is good, even can last 4 days on standby.  Overall, if anyone need a WinMo set on the cheap, this is the set to go for. It has almost everything, and more! Why go for those big branded types that can only go half as far. Get this one before it runs out of stock. You won't regret it!;;;;;Also, it restarts very often:-(.;;;;;do you need a simcard to use this phone? or can you use this even without a sim?;;;;;The 1st day when I used it a lot, it was hot too. But later it will be ok.;;;;;hye yesterday i was just going to buy g810 ..i have try it for a little long time just say one hour and after it i find the cell phone is hot..i asked the shop keeper first he said that is normal with windows mobile but i am a little afraid so if anyone of you can tell me..is it fine or not ?;;;;;Also, have on mind that there is ""cold"" and ""hot"" start at GPS receivers. When you turn on GPS for the first time you need a minute or a few minutes to receive the signal from satellite (be outside, please no obstacles above you toward the sky). This is called ""cold"" start, because for the first time GPS receiver needs much more time to catch the signal. When you turn off GPS and turn it on after (let`s say) 1 hour, it will catch the signal much more faster (this is called  ""hot"" start). P.S. Do not mind. My English is not too good.;;;;;When I bought Toshiba I got iGO maps. It works perfect. Of course, when you use GPS be outside (not in the house or in a closed space). GPS signal can not brake trough walls or similar. It can work near windows (cars, buses...). Also, check in Options is GPS receiver enabled.;;;;;Hello. I managed to install the tomtom, but i can't make it work with the built-in gps. Can one any give me a clue... Thanks in advanced;;;;;It has integrated GPS receiver. Also it has A-GPS.

The only thing I haven't tried is to perform uninstall of spb 2, bu i dont want to mess the device up...is it reall worth upgrading?;;;;;yeah.... just install the spb v3 and it will ask to remove the old version... just select yes... and it will continue to install spb v3...;;;;;The G810 seems to have its whims...When turning the phone on, sometimes it does not prompt for pin and unless you soft reset you may, be called at without hearing anything. System volume is significantly lower than that of an htc device (like tytn II, nonetheless the g810 seem to be fine. Although I am a loyal htc user, I was intrigued to buy it (as a second pda phone, yet I get to use it daily).;;;;;Did you remove the previous spb version, or simply continued to install spb shell 3?

When Im driving I just press my bluetoth call headset and make a command... like making a call... and it is very useful... trust me... espesially when you are driving...... this phone also has copilot live pre installed and licensed when I bought and it is very useful.... it gives you directions while driving although the screen is not big enought though....   But all in all I like it... I just would like to request from toshiba to have a constant upgrade or support on their products.... like ROM upgrades.... software downloads store.... and hope that they will concentrate on windows mobile system only.... not like other brands... that have winddows then sybiam OS.....;;;;;expansys.com Trusted! I've used them alot.  Very, Very good with processing and dispatch.;;;;;Since my last post, the handset's touchscreen has locked up two or three times a day. I found that uninstaling the SPB Mobil Shell seems to have cured the problem as well as prolonged the battery life a lot !! Toshiba have obviously not really tested things enough, so one of the main hyped things about this device has to be uninstalled for it to work properly. A shame, but not too big a deal for me.;;;;;Can any one of you tell me what bluetooth it has? Microsoft or Broadcom? Thanks.;;;;;32gb microsdhc out now? really? can you share the site where we cn buy it legit for the g810;;;;;I bought G810 in mid january, and for about three days the battery wont charge. It worked like a charm before. No matter how long it will charge (AC) it stays at 1% capacity. If I pull out the AC plug, it shuts off imediatly. I tried hard reset, but no luck. I think either the battery or the charging circuits are faulty. I'll just have to wait for the service repairs... ;;;;;First off, just a correction of the specifications. *There is a speakerphone. This handset can take HCSD of at least 8GB. I've had this phone for about a day now and performance wise it's fast ! opening apps takes 1-2 seconds. It has SPB shell. There is no chopiness when playing MP4 movies. One of the most stylish designed Windows Mobile handsets I've seen. Has 3G,HSDPA,HSUPA,EDGE,WIFI. Battery is pretty good. 
Expansys.com has them for £199.;;;;;Do the battery works good? I can see that the stand-by is only 200h but the battery are 1530mAh. On other WinMo phones with the same battery the stanby-time is over 300h.  And another question. Can I change the language to swedish if I buy the phone from Expansys swedish site?;;;;;this phone can play mp4 videos? and how to find free games, software for this phone? anyone know? pls share some knowledge bout this phone.. ;;;;;Well known e-shop  -expansys- sells for this phone gps software: Garmin, TomTom, McGuider, iGO8, Route66 etc. Get the link in greek   and search a litle just after you hear and before you write!!!;;;;;hi all... i need some help here... i'm currently using N95, n everything is good.... but...i'm really interested to buy this Portege G810. how can i compare between G810 vs N95? is it a fair comparison? can someone advise?;;;;;How about GPS? I've heard that it is not possible to install any navigation programms like garmin, tomtom etc. Is it true?;;;;;i have a prebleme whith G810.it is hort service it juste affiching toshiba . please can you hellp me ppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaa lllllllllllsssssssssssee;;;;;yeah the control keys are touch sensitive.... you can assign the controls on the upper controls and at the center. one thing that I dont like the battery life and the accessories... its very hard to find.  The camera in front yes... you can take pictures... you can even put some backgrounds and even edit in your phone.... of course any windows mobile there are lots of add ons and softwares like google maps... even divx player, youtube player, even windows live. But if you have money and you want speed... I'll go for smart phones with cpus 500 to 650 MHz of speed like Blackberry bold, Samsung Omnia, or the toshiba G900 with bio-metrics scanner.... HTC phones also is very popular.... But of course i choose the toshiba because it has a navigation map free of cost... I ask the price of the software it cost around 900 AED. and in HTC it is not free... its a trial version only for 30 days or for3 motnhs but Im not sure on their new version of HTC... Also the style and its unique because you can hardly find any person using toshiba phones.... heheheh   ;;;;;and please tell me can u use the front facing camera to take pictures?;;;;;Hi, how do u describe the control keys? are they touch sensitive or u have to press them?;;;;;I bought this phone last december 28 and it is fine its fast the pre-installed co-pilot navigation software is nice helps a lot when driving. I used 8gb micro SDHC expansion card and it works fine.  Although the tech support told me that it supports only upto 4gb. I downloaded movies like naruto, and lots of music and still system performance is still fine.  Only thing is that battery will last for a day only because Im a heavy user of wifi and gps. also the accessories is not available here UAE. like cover, extra battery.....;;;;;hi, yes it works with 8gb. you can use until 32gb. i work with 32gb. this phone is good.  i have everything accesiries for this if someone needs;;;;;haha... if you want touch flo buy an htc.... the sbp mobile shell of this phone is similar to htc's touch flo and sbp mobile shell was develop first before htc touch flo interface was release... dont comment if you are not using this phone, use it then comment.;;;;;i am using this phone with 8 GB, can u tel me is it compatable for it or not, and where can i get softwares for this.;;;;;The same to HP, Toshiba also manufactures poor technology devices. I think if the screen can be enlarged to 3.5inch, 480x800 resolution, Touch Flo support, 5MP or over camera. ;;;;;may u shall consider to configure buttons option (in Start, Settings, Buttons);;;;;I've found out that this phone Toshiba G810 is not up to my expectation. Design is too old fashion. Bulky too! I better go for Nokia E71. Browsing internet is really fast. Slim. I can say, E71 is heavy but durable.;;;;;I had same prob need to go into today tap programs tap auto and check items the sceens will then download;;;;;i have the same problem, have just got my phone and cant get on the 2 creens either - anyone out there got any clues?;;;;;can anyone help with accessing the home and now screens. my unit wont have it !!!!;;;;;great phone no doubt BEAUTY ;;;;;im currently using this phone..it sux..seriously..the battery sux..i only last max 3 days if u dont talk on it much / barely use wifi..and it couldnt detect my sim contacts..therefore i had to add each contact manually..then the wireless manager button didnt work after 4 days of using this phone..then i had to do a master clear to get it fixed;;;;;In fact it has a full screen QWERTY keyboard and it is really easy to use, just like a hardware keyboard. Very Nice device to buy.  Has sensitive TouchScreen, an easy to use UI, Wi-Fi, GPS, A-GPS, and more and more...  What else can be expected from a PDA?;;;;;The battery of this should be in N95;;;;;what is the difference between windows 5-6 or 6.1????;;;;;do not instal toshiba interface software if your toshiba always hang;;;;;Well...when I read about it on different sites, watched the user guide video, it's features and design really attracted me. It has everything except my lovely QWERTY! Consiquently it was the main reason lead me to sell mine after 4 weeks. But not ony this. Low battery life (i had Nokia N70 and E50 they were superb), touch screen's often errors while typing and though I calibrated it several times it's accuracy didn't advance. And contacts...too complicated! It mixes your hotmail/msn contacts with your outlook contacts i.e normal phone contacts and I couldn't get it resolved. Finally Russian Windows. The English version wasn't yet available in Azerbaijan and it was really annoying me. Conclusion: if you want a smart device but still a good, user-friendly phone and easy typing, G810 is not an appropriate choice!;;;;;i have it set up and working on rogers. perhaps it is your settings. msg me if you want me to send them to you. thanks.   joshua;;;;;Anyone can let me know why Toshiba G810 always hang and performance is unstable.;;;;;the OS is Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional;;;;;Now I learn the Skype problem relate to WM6.1, nothing to do with the phone.

I install Skype and try to echo test, all chop up, no way to hear 1 single word. I find out a grps channel to service provider avaiilable, but the phone show I had 3G (H) connection, so all get screw up ther. If any one can help? How to create a modem entry to use UMTS connection, my other HP 614c create one automatically.;;;;;I am totally agree!!! Expect you want to watch VIDEO or Picture, other wise 640x480 is not good.

So far no major complaint. Speed wise as expected is considered slow by todays standard. However, I was previously using an Eten M600 and in comparison there was no significant difference in performance. Bear in mind this G910 is running on WM6 so that drains performance as well. Overall feature are wonderful. You get almost every features currently available plus fingerprint scanner which is quite cool. You can't get anything else at this price. Screen resolution is wonderful. Now using office application becomes genuinely useable. The clampshell design also suits my usage. Minor complaint is that the speaker volume is a bit too low for both calls and ringer tones emitted. Still, I could live with that. Battery life is just okay but drains dramatically when GPS was used. This is similar to other devices with GPS as well.;;;;;Anyone Know If You Can Use Windows Live Messenger On This?;;;;;Please update the software, all problems will be solved. ;;;;;check www.expansys.com, around 160 british pounds.. if u live outside UK, VAT is waived.. great deal..

I could live without those extruded buttons. I would love a device like this one only slightly improved. Design is too egg shaped. What's wrong with classical pocket address book shape ? The screen is too small. If you're going to make this device useful you need 5 inch screen at least, and you might consider 2:1 ratio. It could be far more useful.;;;;;what the heck is this? visualy it looks like crap.. if they only made it look nicer, people will digg this;;;;;wow its good mobile i use it;;;;;I cannot imagine how would I use the touchscreen. With TyTN you keep the device closed in one hand and use the stylus with the other. When you need keyboard you open it, but then you have little or no use for touch screen.

Working great, battery life 1,5 days on 30 min talking. After you get used with the keyboard and menu is very easy to use. Music player is quite loud for his size. No problems for dialing or answering, hearing volume is high. MP3 can be setup as ring tone, charging fast. I use it as modem on win and mac no problems on both. When is usb connected is charging, on modem mode is running empty in 6-7 hours even if is charging. I keep this phone as a spare one and is better than usb 3G modems. Due to his size, shape, functionality and actual price, G450 is actually more than a regular phone.

I hawe an else charging problem, than ju have dikused. After the battery drained out, I tried to recharge the device, but it would not work. It allways started booting again, ewen if I used USB charger and not the PC. What to do?;;;;;The phone will be charging whenever it is connected through USB, but I believe using 3g/HSDPA speed for internet connection will drain out the battery much faster than it is charging. So far no charging problem using the modem in EDGE mode.;;;;;is this a DDR machine;;;;;why cant charge while is connected through USB as a modem ??;;;;;nice,cool , weirdo , great...;;;;;Yes the battery will drained out after about 2-3 hour of internet browsing at 3g/HSDPA speed. The solution, if you don't need to use full speed 3.5g speed switch to 2g mode. In EDGE mode I found the battery life is not affected with internet browsing or even downloads.;;;;;Has anyone got any problem with the battery? it seems that the battery cuts off everytime i go online with this thing... anyone can rectify the issue?;;;;;No trolling - deliberately antagonizing other brand/model users will get you banned ;;;;;i think this phone is similar to B.Mobile Pike Modem Phone, isn't it???.

I think mine has a softwarwe bug because sometimes after received sms the sms reas as read failed. Then I had to restart to enable  the sms read again . A bit annoying but not very frequent though. Otherwise an excellent modem and acceptable as basic phone ( if you don't mind about small button and eccentric keypad);;;;;that's a nice fone dude;;;;;Just bought the phone for 1 week. Had problem with installing file to the phone memory using u-disk mode. When I want to format the disc we will be asked what is the security code.

Stable connection. - The screen is very-very small but if you want it for modem so use the client soft on your computer. - The ring/sms volume is very LOUD even on the min. It's a soft bug maybe? The ringtones are awful. You can replace them with your mp3. - The mp3 player it's a joke.;;;;;Haha it looks like a turtle shell.. As if any fool would want to buy that!

I'm buying this to go from one extreme to the other.  I wanna keep it simple!;;;;;Obviously this is designed for users who primarily use their phone as an HSDPA modem.

It is in good working order. md;;;;;can someone please sell me this phone?;;;;;i hate my toshiba now,bought it early 2008 n its too old n tired tho its gYnomous size still impresses sum folks,now waitin for the lg optimus 3D,oh yeah i dont care for how much it would go for,folks dont even bother puttin it on ebay,nobody even buys it anymore coz of its popular fucked up battery life.;;;;;Btw, I was reading the comments about the price. It's indeed ""wow-expensive"" but in those days (2007) that was the price for such devices. I remember ""normal"" Samsung slide phones (no OS) having a value of 200-300 euro's. I just checked the receipt for this phone, surprisingly it mentions (don't laugh)  630,00 incl tax.;;;;;You made me laugh @ $200. I'm about to put mines on eBay for a week starting @ 0.01euro (I'm not trolling, my username is start0.01euro). I probably think it will end @ 20-50 euro's because that it is it's value these days. Let me put as example the HTC G1 that is ending @ 50-100 euro's and above the mini-pro @ 100-150euro, etc... etc... However it is a piece of technologie with fingerprint and USB-host capabalities which is quite unique. It's good for geeks/collectors. An Iphone though keeps it's value (even though I think it's overrated, way overrated).;;;;;I would happy to sell mine for $200 + shipping. It is a great phone but I feel it is a bit HUGE :) tell me if you are interested at yuzyin at gmail dot com I used the phone for 8 months and bougth and iphone later. It is still in my drawer :);;;;;For 350 Dollars, this phone was the best for several years given its WVGA Screen and tweekablilties! it was also featured run Windows 7 on such device (Totally servicable).

Finally phonecalls dead. No calls, no answers, no register networks. I wish that they can repair it. By the way, i loved my g900 alltime. It is a great PDA. A great display(even nowadays, after 2 years to released), a fast cpu, large enough memory to run apps, a fast btooth, a great slided keyboard, wireless etc. No GPS, worse cam, biger height, you're right, but price was never as high as its rivals have these even right nowadays, for example htc touch hd. Love your PDA:) About battery life; i used it for a year, up to 1-2 hours minimum in a day to phonecalls and usually for an external gps over bt, charged almost in every nights without fully empty, and still average standby time is 1.5 days in usual use and talk time is 1.5-2 hours.;;;;;This PDA isnt working. when the phone calling you can't answer because phone is freezing. pls. dont buy this phone. Toshiba can't rpair my phone for months.;;;;;how to play the radio?;;;;;This phone can also play the radio even thought it is not mentioned in specifications you just need to learn to work the phone and you have everything on it, its an awesome phone.

There is a option to switch backliht to ""off"" after 10, 30 secs etc.   But this option does not switch off, just keeps the back light at minimum level.  If its makes backlight really off then my problem solved.  ;;;;;your devise meeds reflash. then it will be ok, whre are you from?;;;;;G900, it sleeps and can't wake up. I can't answer the coming calls. Then I have to call them back. Cost me a lot. Toshiba support advised to reset the phone, I did but no difference. When I cancel the energy save option, screen backlite finish the battery in a 4-5 hours.  ANY ONE CAN ADVICE WHAT TO DO ?

This will happen even among the business community, who are compelled to purchase a device compatible with their mainstream desktop  devices in the workplace also powered by an operating system making excessive memory and power consumption demands in comparison with other operating systems. Windows must alter or face serious decline from its current all pervasiveness. As global computing gradually migrates to the mobile environment and away from fixed location platforms such as desktop PCs, the centre of gravity over what operating system will be primarily used for computational purposes could well change from Windows. ;;;;;infact its the OS that hang the system. Go for symbian its the most stable OS or just wait for the android OS google phone.;;;;;What? This phone is ridiculous! It's 20+ millimeters thick, the scrawny 2 MP camera is framed in a bigger glass circle than my N95's 5 MP camera, and it costs more than an N95! I'm sorry to all of you who were hopeful and bought this, but there are better phones out there. Just gotta look harder I guess...;;;;;The answer is NO. Big NO. Unless you need it just to keep it for collection. Everything, I mean everything is working with a huge portion of suck. I am in no need to describe all acpects as it takes a lot of time. Just do not want to waste my time and yours as well. Today I overslept because of this shit. the battery was full but this shit overslept too (what was the reason of mine f...d up). I upgraded software a year ago and still keep re-upgrading but it still self-switch off in many other reasons and you cannot say when and why. UNRELIABLE so much that you can put it in the top of lists of shits. What esle if I miss the calls all the time and do not have the treatment in real or vertual. You do not need perfect screen as it is here if everything else sucks. trust me. You will dream of the simpliest phone for 10 bucks which you can find around.;;;;;pls do not buy it, i own one my mail is adi_1133noy@yahoo.com , it hass manny problems and missing drivers , mail me if you need more information about it.;;;;;Very interesting device , excelent display , good sound (in HeadPhone / Speker) , good finishing , interesting set of features (including USB Host, though i didn't make it to work with a Apacer USB Drive ), the cammera si bad(symilar to the one in 5310 xpress music) , Bluetooth is quite fast , the internal memory (for storing files), is very small and it fills up , and the miniSD memory card format is an unpopular one , the keyboard is very confortable and visible . Th main argument against this device is that is verry slugish even dough it's equiped with a 500 MHZ Processor and 112MB of RAM , and an unconfirmed NVidia GoForce GPU . And the second misshap of this device is the lack of built-in GPS reciever . I only tested the device in an office enviroment , so i don't know how it reacts in direct sunlight (the screen) , and the autonomy of the battery . Anybody with this phone , please say your phone's age and average stand-by/talk times of it . I am waiting sugestions and answers about the battery life .;;;;;i bought this pda 4 month ago.so far it is ok.to set the XT9 off you can go to setting then input method then you choose xt9 then you go to option and disable all the option. your xt9 now is off. Anyone know new firmware pacth for the PDA? cheers.;;;;;Hi again; I bought the phone after all (since noone replied anyway) but I'm *desperately* tyring to disable that T9 option; It's absolutely horrible, everytime I try to type sth sth else comes up and it's absolutely impossible for me to type what I want to type because the damn phone assumes it knows better than me what I want to write. I've tried everywhere to disable that T9 thing but with no luck :(( Not even the salesguy knew how to do it;;;;;Can anyone please give me some advice so as to if I should buy this phone or HTC's S 730? On the one hand I like the fact that Toshiba's screen and keypad sizes are bigger, but I've been reading some bad reviews on how it hangs all the time, you can't read anything on the screen in day light, the camera is bad etc, so I would appreciate it if you could give me some advice too.. thanks :);;;;;Currently im using... SO far no problem, only still not familiar with the phone settings... Just a bit heavy, when using bluetooth headset a bit noisy and ring tone is limited...;;;;;it is amazing!!!;;;;;still waiting for toshiba to send my phone.... really tired of waiting !! they dont even give your money back nor the gsm !;;;;;I have one G900, before I was with a O2 Xda Exec (Jasjar). G900 is a lot better, BUT BECAREFULL, after buying the G900, go to www.myg900.com and update to latest ROM Software, the unit will run realy smooth, I recommend for Business purposes, not for 3D Gamming. Else, is a real 800x480 internet broser, good Exchange mail sync, need freedon? Get one G900.... ;;;;;do not buy this device, it has the goforce 5500 grafix chip but it is lacking drivers from toshiba, because of this and the large display rezolution the device is very slow, it cant be used for browsing, making pictures, waching films at a good rezolution. Do not buy this device , just trying to help people,too bad i didnt know this problems.;;;;;i bought it last year, thought it wa skinda good. after 1 month it just hooked up. i couldnt soft or hardreset it anymore. i gave it back and got a new one this monday. today, thursday, same freaking problem. if the ifone could read and write docs and excel tables i would buy that. ;;;;;i have this phone for 3 months now, here are some of the problems: - hangs every 4 - 5 hrs - hangs when its off (screen off) - install any software, hangs every hour - dead pixel already - internet explorer doesnt work properly after extensive use (after 1 hour) - no screen protector,pouch,extra stylus like the htc products - camera is useless, would have been better if no camera at all - finger print scanner is a gimmick, only used for short cut to open an application (when set) dont know if it works with 3rd party software for security - reset button is inside next to battery, so everytime you have to reset, u have to take off the battery cover, which has become loose already. - goes into silent mode ramdomly 
have sent it back to toshiba, hoping to get my refund ! my adivice DO NOT buy this product. complitely useless. if there was an award for useless product, this one would win hands down !!;;;;;Does it work with normal gps sirf star III receiver? Because their BT standard is SPP... Please answer to me, also to my e-mail;;;;;Question: How about Remote Client to Windows XP/Vista desktop with this phone?;;;;;Hi , let's check out this -> Toshiba G920 ;;;;;great phone.i just think its a pretty heavy phone.its a perfect business phone i guess.  keep it up Toshiba!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;;;;;perfect phone;;;;; its a very special mobile ;;;;; i think that the portege g900 is marvelous. congratullations toshiba;;;;;I own this pocket PC for about 1 and a half months and the experience with it it's just not the most pleasant. For a person that is always on the move and is communication dependent like me it fits perfect. It has the screen with the high resolution, text is clear, very readable and makes web surfing comfortable. Now here are the problems. I think Toshiba released this thing while still in a beta development stage. The early models had a lot of bugs including the standby of death (it goes in to standby and never wakes up). Then came version 2.2 which is the latest and I have it. They fixed many bugs but the standby problem is just half fixed. Now it happens only when data sessions are active, but it still is very annoying because there are apps that connect automatically and then the phone cracks. You will miss a lot of important calls if you are not very careful what apps are running to close them and always check often if the damn thing is deeply sleeping again. Another annoying thing is the battery life. Unless you have a mobile charger with you then a spare battery would be a good idea. Until Toshiba works these bugs out, I suggest that who ever is interested in G900 better look at the offers from the other manufacturers. By the way, support is also very poor. You can read more on myg900.com forum. ;;;;;Well I have the Toshiba M 400 Tablet PC, it was almost the complete PC one can Imagine, except for built in camera, and the connectivity ports (serial and S Video)  Now I see that this G 900 is still a far behind, I wish Toshiba lives up to its slogan of in touch with tomorrow.  I would be ready to buy a Toshiba if it has Quad band, wifi, 512 MB internal SD RAM memory, Multiple memory card slots expandable upto 12 GB, 8 and above Mega pixel camera and  Superb GPS system, even better if it can have double sim card slots.  I belive than they are living up to their slogan of In touch with tomorrow.  This phone lags behind the N95 Nokia 8 GB ;;;;;wow..wow..wow..thats all i can say..zee;;;;;is the phone support by blackberry connected ? ;;;;;WOW! that is one heavy fone;;;;;i just can't get it why they keep making triband phones instead of quadband;;;;;to fiftyone, I am not chef, but I wish to give a help on your question. I am not an owner of this phone, neither the TyTN II Kaiser phone, but I think the TyTN II is more popular because one factor is it has built-in GPS, while this phone doesn't have (according to this site) and another thing is that the brand HTC when it comes to PDA has already established its name. I don't know if my answer was just or has helped your question, but I hope somehow, it did. thanks. :-);;;;;SCENIC: 1. Is the text really readable at 800x480? Does all apps work at this res? Is the screen visible in sunlight?  Not visible at sunlight, the text is readable but really small, and not all programs work at that res (ex, SPB NOW screen) 2. Does it support A2DP? Yes 3. Does the performance lag when 4-5 Apps are running simultaneously? The performance is good. also with lots of apps open. 
4. Can it record video at 640x480@30fps? 
no, only QVGA
 
5. Anybody knows if this handset is available in Malaysia! And what could be the price? 
No idea
 
Thanks in advance.;;;;;To owners: does it have autofocus or macro? Thanks in advance;;;;;is there already a ROM upgrade for G900? Where can i find it? I need it badly. Someone pls help.... ;;;;;oh well.... n95 8gb might win this but n95 lose totally if you talkin about pda phone as n95 don have touch screen, smaller screen, & basically you guys cant compare with this 2 phones as n95 more likely to be a 'phone' meanwhile g900 more likely to be a 'pda phone' juz a piece of my mind no hard feelin;;;;;The_Chef it would be great if you could give us an update on your experiences with the G900. It appears that this phone is not as popular as HTC's TyTN II which seems to be selling well. I wonder why? There must be specific reasons. Toshiba were brave to go for a staggering WVGA res on a three inch screen so they should be commended. Yet it is clear that the present day PPC user craves for and expects fast, dynamic, reliable operation. FDR operation coupled with VGA and WVGA res on small screens  (2.6-3.5 inch screens) is proving to be an Everestian challenge!;;;;;hey jojo, how's the phone's performance so far? also, is it user friendly? hope you can enligthen me more. thanks!;;;;;Happy blackberry user, but got this phone as gift. Wow, this is huge compared to my blackberry pearl, I think I may ebay it;;;;;Future firmware will solve most of the problems.If you care to think back a few years the htc jasjar was released and even though it had a 520mhz cpu it was quite slow,now with an updated ROM the jasjar is very fast indeed.Same deal with the  G900 ;;;;;Well, guys. So far very quick thoughts. I still have it but... try HTC before buying this toy. Memory is not enough to run even small package of programs. Painfull! Believe me. You are not thinking of modern phone. You are thinking of Pocket PC. What them the point if simple phone has sometimes even more power and capability? So this is the main lack of G900. That is why perhaps the camera hang the system. Or sometimes it dies and you have to remove and then set battery again. Maybe this is not a common thing. And resolution! Trust me it is not more important than the other features. So I'd prefer less this stuff rather than limitation in other features. CPU is realy a little slow compared to HTC. And camera is terrible 'cause without auto focus it is pointless.;;;;;Hi all, Great day. Found every thing promising so far with G900. But recently found in myg900.com that this phone is pretty slow compared to others even if it has fast processor. Any real user can share experiences? Also does anyone know if it does have a graphics or 3D chip inside? Anybody know which could be the best alternate of this one (ofcourse WM6)? Best Regards.;;;;;Would appreciate very much if somebody could explain the below concerns: 1. Any real user to share the experience with 800x480 resolution. Are the texts really readable at that res? does all apps work? is the screen visible in sunlight? 2. Does the performance lag when 4-5 Apps are running simultaneously? 3. Can it record video at 640x480@30fps? 4. Anybody knows if this handset is available in Malaysia! And what could be the price? Thanks in advance.;;;;;Zaelo the zealot we would be honoured if you could give us an update on your experiences of the controversial G900.;;;;;The specs are great but in papers everything looks fine. Would appreciate very much if any real user could explain the below concerns: 1. Is the text really readable at 800x480? Does all apps work at this res? Is the screen visible in sunlight? 2. Does it support A2DP? 3. Does the performance lag when 4-5 Apps are running simultaneously? 4. Can it record video at 640x480@30fps? 5. Anybody knows if this handset is available in Malaysia! And what could be the price?
 
Thanks in advance.;;;;;People, i absolutely love this phone for its screen (have a TyTN right now).  Almost went to buy it, but decided to see experiences with it. And they are awful! Take a look for example at myg900.com how many people are complaining... I guess it is not time for replacing my TyTN...;;;;;Hi all,       I am from Singapore. Wonder anyone know where I can get a pcs of this device. Function fit my usage. Thanks.;;;;;To Boi: Ok, fine you don't like 65K? How about 65001? Better? Now shut it.;;;;;Hey the_chef, that was an awesome review. People like you make this site worth using again :);;;;;Hi, The_Chef I've got one of those G900 and a 4gb mini sd is about to arrive..  So it wont work? Or do you think that if you update the firmware it can still works? tnx ;;;;;I have one. In case people are still confused about the specs: It only has 40MB internal memory, so you NEED a mini-SD card (not a problem for me cause I was gonna get one anyway). 128MB RAM - I understand this is very good for a mobile device, I still haven't used it up fully. Of course the #1 selling point is the screen, WVGA (800x480) in just a 3"" screen! I dunno why people are complaining about the size of the screen or the writing being too tiny. You can just zoom in if the writing is too small, and I'm sure the writing will be clearer than a 320x240 screen of similar size.  However I can't comment on the colour depth, I haven't really noticed devices more than 64k colours.  But I do know that for web surfing and image/pdf viewing, you can fit more of the screen on here than on any other device of similar size.  Basically if the writing is too small for you, buy a bigger device with a bigger screen (a proper PDA).
 
Secondly the fingerprint recognition owns, and you can use it as a cursor/trackball (although unfortunately you can't see a cursor, just the links that you highlight). 
Apart from that it is a very new device, so you get almost all the Windows Mobile 6 goodness.  
Supports Wifi b/g, and WPA2 encryption. 
Bluetooth 2.0 EDR, and A2DP (stereo bluetooth) and AVRCP (remote control). 
It's 3G/HSDPA too (which is still not common enough for PDAs). 
Uses mini-SD card, which is cheaper than micro-SD, and hot swappable. 
Keyboard is very good. Decent size keys, and most reviews actually PREFER this keyboard over the HTC devices (e.g. Tytn), cause the keys are raised/rounded here. I prefer it simply because there are more keys, period. 
The unit itself is a bit bulky (a bit bigger than a Tytn), but that's forgivable considering the excellent keyboard and decent sized screen.
 
Now for the bad points.  
Firstly no SDHC support!!! So you can't get more than 2GB reliably at a time (yep I've tried ""4GB non-SDHC mini-SD"" but they aren't reliable). 
And yep shame no internal GPS (although everyone always says an external GPS box is 100x better anyway) 
And I have to admit the 3g and wifi reception is actually quite poor. 
Triband must suck for Americans too (although I assume this won't be a problem in the future). 
Camera (which is 2MP) is decent for a phone 2 years ago, but crap by my standards. As for video I don't mind QVGA, but I really needed 30fps.
 
Lastly the main thing putting this phone's reputation down is the early bugs. True, if you bought one of the early phones, you were in big trouble, with it refusing to come out of standby half the time. This was partially resolved with a patch, but only satisfactorily resolved with newer batches that contained a newer rom.
 
Overall I'm satisfied with the newer more stable version of the G900. Like most others, am willing to forgive the substandard camera and a few other issues for an excellent screen for web browsing, and imo excellent keyboard.
 
It's biggest competitors imo are the Nokia E90 (better camera, but unfortunately no touchscreen, and I would prefer Windows Mobile for apps than Symbian), and the forthcoming HTC Kaiser (which should have everything you need..  except the screen is still 320x240)
;;;;;why still 65k LCD????;;;;;Here a review of the G900 ;;;;;Can anyone tell me if this phone support Blackberry Connect or not. Thanks so much.;;;;;does the camera have auto focus?;;;;;nice features, I should buy it!;;;;;Canadians are great (although I'm not Canadian) and have made important contributions towards mobile communications eg the ubiquitous Blackberry series ----------------------------------- To produce Blackberry with slolen technologies is crime. That's why they were enforced to pay billions. In America they would be imprisoned. In canada they are free because there it is normal such behavior. So there they are heroes. Blackberry has dead end. Again, because its structure and limited improvement possibilities. It was good pager maybe. let it still remaina a good pager, maybe. But customer needs something different. Just wait for a couple of years and tell me if you forget this name ""Blackberry"". :);;;;;All right. Since I have this phone I can share some information with the others about it. Forget sheep-type screaming like ""Oh, what a great phone"". Be reasonable. Firstly, the size of the phone is good. Good for a phone with enhanced features but for a PDA. Because whatever screen gives you pixels it is SMALL for a PDA. SMALL. The excellent quality? Not so excellent with 65K and you can use the largest letter mode only. Why the hell you need microscopic or about it letter modes. To connect to big screen? But it does not a plug so it is pointless at all. And one who worked with it for 30 minutes have lost his sight tremendously. Just get the thickest glasses if you use this device. This device will damage your sight unless you set the letter mode as the largest. So the screen is very small for a PDA. And big for the just phone. In whole the size is great as I said for a featured phone. PHONE not PDA!  Secondly, weak 3G receiving. The way it does synchronization with Outlook better does not have at all. Working with programs is real headache. You cannot minimize. Or if it calls minimizing let it never be such. You cannot minimize for instance media player. Even when you tap quit button it still plays. So you need to start it then stop then quit again. Thirdly camera just naturally sucks. After 5-6 second starting camera you cannot make a snapshot unless you set it onto tripod. The settings are not being saved so you spend minutes to try to set them. No auto focus let it be no camera. Zoom X2 is not working in all modes why then it is digital. You do not see the difference. You really do not need it.  Four. Did you try to record yourself? Yes? Then you probably bought already a voice recorder. The sound is awful in this device. And could you try to connect this recorded notes to anything in this device? Of course not as this note is standalone feature. It does not work with calendar. Then why I need it. To spend minutes to find it and play it back? I do not need it for that. Call recording? None. The simple phone has it why this beauty non. Ok! It is just a very beginning. And you already bored. So do I. I can write volumes of it. Who wants to? To the whole: This is sooo stupid to give a customer the feature which is pointless. And this device just has over your head such ones. It is no like it has all in one. I would prefer to buy this all separately. Then why do I need this toy as a phone when I can spend in at least 5 time less to get more powerful phone?;;;;;Have this phone. The screen is really amazing, never seen this quality before. Exelent features and performance, the only issue is its size and weight, a bit heavy and not so comfortable for pocket carriers persons. Ill need to buy a pouch or something like that. Camera quality is OK, a little washed but tolerable. The fingerprint reader can be used as Mouse Scroll on Internet and Apps in both directions (V and H) thats a really good not mentioned feature. Another Con is that the device is unable to open youtube mobile videos as it is not compatible with RSTP protocol. I heard about some ways to do it touching the registry and installing some apps but thats not for me. I heard ASX streams with out any trouble. Questions?;;;;;How many times are you guys going to compare with Nokia?Don't be so damn ridiculous.Symbian s60 is praised from many sources but use it and see what it's really like.I want a PPC to run full quality programs not some half thought out,made in 25minutes 100kb symbian app.If you think Nokia is so good trot off and buy an E90-Nokia claim it's the best unit for web browser!!sure thing.;;;;;Zaelo, you obviously have a problem with Canadians. I for one believe that Canadians are great (although I'm not Canadian) and have made important contributions towards mobile communications eg the ubiquitous Blackberry series. On the other hand you have made zero contributions apart from your ridiculous self-centred concept about mobile devices. All you talk about is what you personally need or like in a phone. Understand that I am talking about technological advances in all aspects of the multimedia palette. This is beyond the whims and caprices of an individual like you. That means on a high-end phone such as this, you are supposed to have a minimum of 3.2MP stills cam. Why? Because it produces printable photos. Video recording should be VGA at 30fps. Why? Because it produces sharp smooth running videos. The 3.0 inch screen should be able to display 24 bit, 16M colours. Why? Because it gives a more vivid and clearer encounter when working with multimedia. This is not simply a PDA. It is a multimedia business device, therefore the features have to meet contemporary standards. If Toshiba sincerely feel that stills and camcording are unimportant they should not include them, instead of giving us third rate features. When a manufacturer meditates on a feature and decides to implement it on a high-end phone (as opposed to a budget one), they have a duty to give you the best. I am not saying that the features should be as good as dedicated devices but they should meet reasonable standards. If the truth be said, the scientists at Toshiba cut back on quality in certain areas and they should not have done. The fact that it is only tri-band is a further irritant and limits its potential use.;;;;;To Zaelo: Stop bashing the Canadians. We are not interested with your grievances or neither do we want your prejudice on here. If you do not want technological improvements and business apps then why the hell get yourself a PDA in the first place? There are still plenty of telephone booths around every country so why even get yourself a mobile??? About 12-13 years ago before mobiles became mainstream, making calls and receiving them was very patchy due to poor coverage, SMS (text) was only to same network, no cameras, no video recorders, no MP3 players, no web surfing etc, etc...You're as guilty as every other mobile user in wanting bigger, better faster more.  Why should we get fobbed off by manufacturers putting in a great piece off technology next to a sub standard one? Cost cutting? Damn, you can get a decent laptop for the price of some of these PDA's, albeit a lot less portable. He's right, leave out the poor camera etc and cut the costs to consumers.;;;;;Zaelo, you misunderstand the point. Toshiba should give users the choice. If you personally do not need high-end features that is your choice but it is also anti-technology and anti-progress. There is no point in placing substandard stills and camcording in the device. Better for those features not to be there than to impose a lousy experience on the user. We are not machines; we are humans. Business and pleasure go hand in hand. You cannot work to a high standard if you do not rest. People want business and pleasure on the SAME device. Companies such as Nokia have proved time without number that this is possible. The E90 has a high res screen, business apps but still gives you reasonable imaging. Since this phone is high-end it should include reasonable features. Oh yes...Zaelo, don't pretend that this is not a multimedia device (geared towards business). Ask yourself what internet, stills cam, video cam, radio, WLAN, e-mail are doing on the device.;;;;;First, those who wrote against G900 are with canadian syndrome (never have seen but know everything) or real canadian (which automatically have this syndrome since they were born). I had Nokia, I had HTC, I had i-Mate. G900 could have some weak parts but... I do not need super video camera in it, I do not need colors more than 65K for PDA and I do not need super surround sound for PDA. And what I need this G900 has in whole and even more. The other ""writers"" just very seem to be out of ability to read at all because their capability of getting information has a lack. Very big one! Till now this is the most convinient, the most (and more than enough for PDA!!!!) feature holding, comfortable to use PDA phone. Neither Nokia nor HTC have such finger-top featured unit.   ;;;;;Guys, no panic! Toshiba already released the patch to fix the problem for the incoming calls on a blank screen; check   for the update. Let's say the truth, so long it's the best on the market as a screen resolution, processor speed & + WM Professional 6. If doesn't have GPS, it's not a big deal, you can buy a bluetooth one & keep it in you car... the should do the colours just like Nokia's sceens - 16mln...;;;;;I'm glad i did not purchase this PPC. Have you lot heard about the massive problems with this device? Toshiba of all companies should know better! It's not like its a cheap rip-off company somewhere in the depths of China making cheapo knock offs...or is it...I've been waiting for over two years now to replace my MDA Compact with the right PPC but nothing yet. HTC Kaiser looks promising but the screen resolution is still MDA Compact class, what's that all about after 2-3 years? Even Nokia's ""smartphones"" have better resolution and colour depth (N80 etc).;;;;;Hey, my thoughts exactly, you're 100% right. I think we should not get on the ""I want latest gadget"" bandwagon unless it has features worthy of its time in the relevant markets. I think they are cutting corners and saving themselves a bundle of cash. Some new technology with some old technology, ie screen colour depth, camera resolution etc...;;;;;Well what can I say. It sure looks like a worthy contender to Nokia's E90. A few points puzzle me. Why are so many pocket PCs stuck on 65k colours? It makes the screen look washed out. What's the point of great resolution with weak colours? Secondly why do pocket pcs religiously insist on substandard video recording and stills photography? If the manufacturers feel that they are unimportant why not leave them out of the device ?? Lastly where is the wisdom in making the device triband thereby restricting its use???;;;;;omg what a great phone with 520 mhz procesor. i love this phone and its camera and its desing and its features too;;;;;this phone good prodction but iam arabic man and i need  know the phone have arabic vargion only this my proplime plz. send to me on my e-mail thanx;;;;;it is writing above... video= Qvga= 240x320 pixels...;;;;;Does anyone know the video resolution of this phone?thanx;;;;;if you want the best pda phone with gps you need to wait for htc kaiser aka t-mobile vario III... the only drawback of kaiser is the classic qvga screen.;;;;;Has anybody got one of these yet, heard it was out in the UK on Friday. Let us know what it is like.;;;;;very good mob in the markit at ;;;;;Gasp!! This design is a copy of the  cingular8525;;;;;Too thick at 22/23mm, and bad shutter lag according PDA mag review. Also no GPS. Glofiish X800 looks better on most counts - pity the X500+ isn't 3G;;;;;1GB Rom is okay but...256 ram? Are you crazy? Yeah, what else? A battery lasting a lifetime? Some people just ask and ask without real need. How come it has ""only"" 40mb of ram? It has got 128 mb of Ram, are you saying that windows mobile 6 and drivers take up to 78mb or ram? Are you crazy too?;;;;;Got the processor speed : 520MHz. Ok that's fine for now but they really stuffed it by giving it ONLY 40MB of RAM. DAMN, it's going to end up running out of memery if you start loading it up and opening app after app without shutting them down. That's like sending Amir Khan in with Tyson for 12 rounds...I really wanted this PDA for the PDA stuff.;;;;;Can anybody tell me the type and speed of the processor. If it is capable of doing VoIP then does it have to be a pretty quick processor or does it not matter? 1GB ROM and 256MB RAM minimum and GPS would have been pretty much ideal for me for at least a year, but then again it does give us the WVGA screen. No doubt there will be other 'must have' features coming out next year or later this year.;;;;;USB 1.1 does knock me back a bit but it does say you can use USB keys, albeit at snails pace i suppose. Can't have everything, is there any other PPC better specced out there? If there is i'd like to know before i order a Tosh G900.;;;;;usb 1.1  wtf???;;;;;Compared to the TyTN this is a Gozilla spec PPC. Surfing the net on WiFi and reading MS Apps should be a doddle on the Tosh G900.  Hello Tosh, got a TOSHIBA?;;;;;I am waiting for this one to come out. I'll get the Nokia 6500 slider for phone calls when it comes out and a medium end digital camera for pictures. I know that it's a lot of gadgets but this Toshiba has a heck of a screen, 800x480. HTC are you watching??? Beat this on spec and size and you have a customer in me. I lusted after the N95 but then fell out of love with it. Be serious Nokia lovers the N95 has great spec but i hear that the camera isn't true 5MP and battery life ""sux"" besides i have found Pocket PC's easier to live with and for data handling. PS i also have an N80 and MDA Compact (love it, well below spec these days though and need WiFi).;;;;;How does this compare to the Tytn? They seem to have pretty similar specs, except the screen res. Are there any compatibility issue with having a screen this size? Ed.;;;;;The one killer problem with the N95 which puts me right off. is the battery life... anyphone you have to charge up daily or even every other day is pointless!!!!;;;;;N95 beat G900 on GPS, But G900 beat N95 on qwerty keyboard, fingerprint recognition, display resolution.;;;;;N95 kills this fone;;;;;omg! the display has a VGA resolution! beat that nokia! haha;;;;;Opera browser?;;;;;Would like to know if it has a mp4 player or windows media player. I play more than i work!!!;;;;;the best pda i'v seen. wow...! ;;;;;nice ppc, i like it. and price ??? ;;;;;his is A £65;;;;;This phone looks amazing. Really high res display. Nice keyboard layout and windows mobile 6.

Its because, they dun wan to make this phone too heavy and costly. Dun ask more from it..... Its already announced and they will never change anything more;;;;;C'mon Toshy without GPS, Faster CPU, FM Radio, and better Camera... small chances u will win against HTC Kaiser and E-TEN M900.;;;;;4 that wight it should have GPS and radio, without them its a waste, and to hevy 2 attach anything to it.;;;;;I was wondering if anyone knows what the processing speed/power of this phone is?;;;;;This thing is a mini-laptop! Just wish it had GSM 850 for the states...;;;;;With GPS, smaller size and 3mgpxl camera it will be perfect!!;;;;;it has gprs but not gps;;;;;does it have touch screen?;;;;;Great PDA, probably the best coming soon one with keyboard!;;;;;does this have gps? i hope it is capable of that..i been looking for a pda phone that has gps, touch screen, full qwerty, at least 262k color screen,wifi of course, and at least 2mp cam...this would be a great candidate if it has gps...don't really care about tv signal...;;;;;the screen res is 800x480..spectacular;;;;;I think that GPS is more important than HSDPA in a PocketPC.. with 3G speed is enough!!;;;;;It´s a very very good phone! it's quite big, but it has a big screen. I think that 3' screen and slide-out qwerty keyboard are very useful for bussines and for spare time to see mp4, to play with games or to see tv. Its black point is hasn't GPS integrated!! and it can be better with 3mgxl camera, with analog radio and with a smaller size.

Toshiba,G500,";;;;;Does anyone still use this phone?;;;;;subrata ......... very good  phone      sachin you have this ;;;;;nice but annoying;;;;;hello for toshiba company,I want mobile toshiba phone for me,thank you very much;;;;;not easy to use,but i belive its a nice phone,then where can i get the bateries;;;;;the the worst i ever used. i would suggest do not by under any  circumstances. Even dont take if any one gives for free;;;;;it is easy to use but hard to find the battery. where can i buy it;;;;;well, its the second time i bought this phone (since my first one was stolen) and for once more i have to say that its an excellent phone indeed. fast wi-fi, good enough camera for a wm5 se device, many apps to download,but it's only handicap is it's battery limited stamina.....had to buy a second one. but still, it's great!;;;;;me too same problem :(;;;;;i like this model of phone...;;;;;iam interest to use this mobile;;;;;just say this is a wanderful mobile.i love it;;;;;no out going calls ? it shows call ended as soon as i call. only in comming calls . why its so ?;;;;;It lack of features. Selecting of items for copying and cutting such as images, mp3s, text messages, etc. are not improved. Selecting are processed one by one. It's not easy to use. And the GPRS in the Philippines cannot be used in Toshiba G500. It's very poor. I hope Toshiba company will improve this given problems.;;;;;Drop call, switch to silent profile after incoming call, noisy---Toshiba service center said it has good voice pickup. Other problems due to Microsoft, the hardware is OK.  Never use Toshiba again. After one year use of G500, I switch to Nokia E52. My last phone, Ericsson T610, I used it for 3 years until the shell broken down.  G500 has tons advanced functions, none of them work.  1. The profile can switch to silent if the calendar is marked busy. It works, but not switch back after meeting. I disabled this function, it switch to silent profile after each incoming call. So, I have to set the silent profile same as normal profile. Before meeting, I have to modify the normal profile to disable ringer sound. Very annoying. 2. Received lots of complain about voice quality. G500 picks lots of background voice. T610 is better than this high tech. phone.
 
3. I set the wifi, if I entered wrong key, it hard reset the phone. 
 
4. Usually drop call after one ring.
 
I deliver this phone to toshiba serive center. In Hong Kong, Toshiba is selling through Chevalier. The service lady has very good manner.
 
""Soory for lots of background noise. This means this phone has very good reception. For the other problems, they are not a matter of Toshiba. This is due to Microsoft Windows problem. So, we have noway to solve it. I can try to reset."" Then, hundred times of sorry.
 
Not thing improved after reseting.
 
Toshiba never takes responsibility of what it sold.  ;;;;;Hello Dears How i can get my contact nymber from the Sim card;;;;;the phone is not touch screen and the wi-fi is easy to activate it.start>options >connections>wi-fi connection.it might not work if you don't have any internet provider around you.when you connect to a internet connection is asking for wep key.you need to know this except if the internet is free .;;;;;I've got a problem to use the phone like a modem to nagigate in internet, can you help me?thanks a lot.N;;;;;guys please tell me is it touch screen phone or not?;;;;;how to use wi fi and i am not able to operate internet in toshiba g500.please tel me .;;;;;Hey, CPU frequency of G500 is 420 MHz not 312!;;;;;@SHARMA - Leave the useless Pocket Media Player... Install the freeware TCPMP (Google this abbreviation) or the commercial version of the same program named CorePlayer.

There isn't an option to save as ringtone which I would expect, and the manual sheds no light on the matter either!! Thx;;;;;well, i bought it 7 days ago and allthough i used to despise windows mobiles, i love this one! it's very good, has a really fast wi-fi connection,a good interface, not much of a camera of course, but camera is not all that matters on a smartphone.adding the fact that i bought it for only 89euros....it was a real bargain!!!!!!;;;;;I have a chocolate fire guard thats more reliable then this.;;;;;Hi,can anyone tell me from where I can download  the software CD for free? I just bought the phone, it is awesome, but it came without the CD. Thanks;;;;;This phone sucks.  WM5 sucks too.  Was using Symbian S60 3rd, switched to this phone for 1 week.  Big disappointment.  A simple function will require 4-5 clicks.  e.g. In messaging, switching from Inbox to Sent Box requires you to dig into the menu, select folder and pick the folder... Holy not making sense. Immediately switched to Samsung i450 after 1 week of G500.  Loving my Samsung now.;;;;;hi, i am happy wth d mobile;;;;;awsome phone! love it!;;;;;I can't really see Toshiba's Future with mobile phones, they have made some good handsets but their competiton is going nowhere, I mean, what's a G500, why are the copying the likes of Samsung and Sony Ericsson, why are they trying to ashame the big names in the Cellular World? They should just give up and continue making what they normally make like Televisions and DVD Players and stop trying to mock the Mobile Phone World. I rest my case!!!;;;;;fingerprint reader can store 'all' of your finger prints.. all ten! they can be linked for launching applications before going deep down the menu. very useful feature but wont work while eating fried chicken..with advanced usb connectivity we have a little pc-clone here I must add.. cute. On the other hand I noticed that gsm reception indoors is a little weak, could be my gsm operator though.;;;;;fingerprint reader on the back can browse selection bar with the same hands pointing finger. if you wanna lock the phone with that you have to setup a simple pincode too. wifi strong, lacks of good UI. feels solid in general. slider does not answer calls but ends it(?). use with 2gb toshiba miniSD card. camera not that good but if you rely on phone for your next gallery then even toshiba cant help you .) ;;;;;I have it. it's a quite awesome little toy for that price. if you install the starttoolkit freeware it feels like a little simcard-free wifi vista device.. lots of freeware out there.. if you have a toshiba laptop like me .. thats the 'phone' for you.. didnt mind for gps since the price diffrence with gps enabled phones allows you to afford an extra gps device and have a nice evening out.;;;;;I have it. The finger print is useful in case you lose the phone and noone wont be able to access it. Also stops from random ppl accessing it. Quite usefull. The phone works on any GSM network. So, will work in US/Canada;;;;;Can it work in Japan???;;;;;i dont have this phone but curious about the finger print feather that this phone has. is it good, useful....?;;;;;Does it work in Canada and USA?;;;;;I've received a gift (G500) but the language is set to greek, does anyone know how to change it to english or to reset the phone.;;;;;i bought it today and im still happy of it, but ringtone and music from its speaker is so god damn quiet that i doo know how i will live with it;(;;;;;Hi Is dere anyone who cd help me with dese details USB transfer speed from phone mem to PC and vice versa from Memory card to pC n vice verssa similary for Blueetooth device i got this phone but its crashed . i need it for my project details example i need the time in seconds and size of file in KBytes thank you;;;;;Is it a Symbian phone or not guys?

And for the underline, while writing the message, press and hold  the # key. That should bring up all the special symbols (like slash, dot, semicolon etc), so you should be able to choose the underline.;;;;;what about the video specs of this phone?resolution, FPS,format???;;;;;The best phone ever. it's has everything you need...even more.a little slow although. anyway i totaly recomand to buy this smartphone;;;;;I just bought the new Toshiba Portègè G500 and how do you lock your keypad? and when i write am sms,email,etc. i can't find the underline( _ )anyone has the same problem?;;;;;Bluetooth is 2.0v with (A2dP).. 1.2 for miniusb. Looks good, great phone toshiba came out, like there laptops[Got 2 of toshiba dual core n finger print reader] Yes fingerprint reader is very useful. Incase of private things on your phone, you could lock. [The reader is on back of phone when u slide it out] Also if u get the phone stolen no one can get into it unless they know how relfash the firmware. [Most thieves don't know how to do that ] All in All Better than Iphone and Cheaper. [ F700 is also better iphone] Iphone = Brand ;;;;;Im curious about the fingerprint reader does it work? Is it usefull? ;;;;;marina_kodato@hotmail.com i want to buy a cellphone...with a good camera...and maybe wi-fi... this camera is good? or sony's cameras is better??? thanks;;;;;i got this phone & is really a advance phone now avalable in the market. fingerprint reader,wireless,bluetooth etc..i personall think its a all rounder and is packed full of feature. i honestly recomend this phone;;;;;Got one a week ago and gotta say it's hot.

Which speaker is better N95 or Toshiba G500? thank you;;;;;Ergonomically pretty good, functionally excellent.  Downside, it turns off randomly every hour so I have sent it back.  Took a risk going toshiba and proved to be risky.  Would not recommned, it is good and both G500 and G900 will probably be excellent in later versions but I would recommend stearing away from the first versions available or you may suffer the same fate as me... Tony;;;;;On   says that it has Bluetooth V2.0 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate).;;;;;Of course business users need BT v2.0, to use it for a data connection to a laptop.

Toshiba,TS605,";;;;;Nice;;;;;I have one of these phones, very user friendly and the battery as good performance. Not big on standby time but good on real life usage. Unfortunately it was a disaster. Worst buy ever for me and why? Simply because it can't cope with the humidity of the Azores Islands. After only 3 months of usage the keyboard was completely mess up, due to moist.  ;;;;;The main problem with this phone is the very low volume from the speaker. And this is a VERY BIG problem. It is a mobile phone after all and not hearing the phone because you are in the next room it is really bad. There is also NO led or something to indicate that you lost a call. I have gone back to my old Siemens CF62. You can't miss a call with that one. Very loud speaker and so many leds that looks like a Christmas tree if you miss a call.

Toshiba,TX80,";;;;;Still good, like India and Pakistan. Asiatic people mostly use dumb phones, because of no 3g Technology, Mostly they use phone for call and sms, and big talk time, which not possible in Smart phone.;;;;;do u use this cell????????????????;;;;;Hi Toshiba ur's TX80 is a mobile phone or a calculator...such a UGLY phone I ever seen...should take my advise....stop making mobile phone... ;;;;;your right there they have always been stealing idea's;;;;;i bouhgt 904t for my girlfriend and 911t for me,there's nothing better then toshibas and sharps,nokia never again,nokia just stilling ideas from japanese mobile market;;;;;Currently living in Japan, so I bought the Japanese version.  Got it cuz I wanted a good camera and good music player all on one phone, and also one that can type in Japanese for practice as well as will work in the US (have to pay to get it unlocked somewhere). (keep in mind this is the Japanese version, Softbank 811T) Quick overview:  cons- -No bluetooth -Music player only plays mp4 files (it comes with a program for converting but it has trouble installing on non-japanese installs of windows.  i got it to work but it won't recognize japanese/chinese/korean text in song files)--notice: this con may not be applicable to the non-japanese version -Camera has no auto focus, not great flash -I think its kinda ugly pros- 
-3mp camera has great quality most of the time 
-Music player is pretty good, has equalizer and is quite usable (first phone mp3 player i've used so take this for what its worth) 
-Can control music player without opening phone via buttons on outside 
-Easy to press/see buttons (fully backlit too) 
-Good size (not huge, esp considering the wealth of features) 
-Outside lights for notification of new emails etc 
-Supports video call with secondary front-mounted vga camera 
-Quite usable interface 
-Upgradable/removeable memory (mirco sd card, max size as of Oct. 07 = 2gig) 
-3g and quadband gsm support
 
Personally I have always wanted a phone that would be my music player, camera, and phone, and not suck.  With the nice 3mp camera (even with no auto focus and not much of a flash) and the music player (which I find just fine) I am quite happy with this phone.  No bluetooth support is kind of stupid and a big pain for some.. I personally am ok with it.  The Japanese one DOES make a sound when you take a picture, although it's not very loud.  I keep it on vibrate most of the time but I don't feel like the ring is exceptionally loud.  Hope this helps, sry it's the Japanese version.;;;;;Does the 811T have the same mobile charger as the 903SH? I really want to know! I really like  the look of the orange one.;;;;;Just bought TX80 in red color, which is a japanese version with Chinese firmware. Overall, the phone is nice in terms of sound(via headphone), screen, build quality and reception quality. The only drawback is the absence of the bluetooth. With just few japanese phone in the market, we cannot be too demanding for them. I would still recommend this phone to everyone. ;;;;;Does anyone know what the sound is like on this mobile? Is it loud?;;;;;Scary, looks like a baby moniter. Or something you can get in a pound shop;;;;;it looks like an octopus...;;;;;bought it, everythings good cept that no bluetooth kinda sucks when sending stuff and no autofocus makes it kinda hard to take pics.

Well done toshiba, it looks excellent for normal photos and also self shots..you can even use ur phone as a mirror to apply lipstick, haha.

The phone is only good for Japanese users. It's just too complicated. Has many features, but they are only good for people in Japan/Taiwan/China.

I've tried almost everything, and so far .3gp and .mmf are the only file types that work, .mmf being the higher quality of the two.  Today I decided to make a search in Japanese for ""chaku-uta"" files, and I stumbled upon a guide for converting to .mmf files.  The program supplied is a Japanese program, and it is excellent.  You can choose the sampling rate for the .mmf files, and its obviously been designed for making ringtones (you can even make your own vibration/LED pattern for each song).  Make sure to cut your song to around 20 seconds, and convert to .wav.  The resulting .mmf must be 300kb or under to work.  Scroll down to the bottom, all the programs are supplied there (the most important being mmf converter, and SSD-MA3-SMAF, which is required for installation.;;;;;how can i put some mp3 files on my vodafone 903T??email me pls...thanks..;;;;;Design: 8 out of 10 Great looking phone, clean and simple.  I think it could be perhaps be a little thinner or at least lighter, and a little shorter.  Overall its a pretty bulky phone.  Also, the hinge seems a little flimsy.   Features: 7 out of 10 To be honest, if you're using this phone outside of the Vodafone network (like in America), you're missing most of the key features like the GPS and browser.  The GPS wasn't a big deal to me, but not being able to use the browser was kind of a bummer.  The biggest disappointment though is the lack of MP3 support.  Not being able to use my own ringtones is a huge disappointment to me (3GP 's quality is absolutely terrible), and I'm currently trying to figure out how to convert my MP3s to Mpeg-4 aac+, which is the format of the Chaku-Uta ringtones, and I'm not even sure if it'll support that. Everything else program wise is pretty much standard.  The large screen is nice, and the camera seems to perform well also.   Performance: 8 out of 10 As a regular phone it performs well, but theres really nothing too special about it.  The lack of support for 850mhz is also something that American buyers need to remember.  I get decent reception, but definitely not as good as my Cingular 3125, which I usually get full bars everywhere I go.   I bought this phone because I found it for a good price and wanted to have a phone for when I next go to Japan.  If you're only planning on using it in America and were hoping to get a ""super advanced Japanese phone"", you should probably just save your money.  If you're looking for a Japanese phone just because its Japanese, this one is a good choice. ;;;;;if yuo want to experience watchings mtv clips here is the quick guide on activating your mms/grps/streaming.. for 3g settings for smart users only: type in:  set N90   ----send it to 211 go back to the main screen and don't touch anything even if there is a message just don't read it and keep it onto the main screen and never touch anything until you the mms/gprs/streaming settingswill arrive...and if it asks for a pincode just type in 1234....after that just turn off your phone and turn it on again...try to go in vodafone live and it should direct you to smart hmepage..... note:you should have a load at least P15... if you have some few questions just try to text me onm y number 09184219142...if I can't reply onto your message it means got no load :p hehehe...;;;;;Do you think this is like a laptop or something? what's with the 149g!;;;;;hi i download some mp3 to my memory card and i can't play it on my phone  i save it to other files then i save it to sounds and ringtones and now i cannot find it plz help i want to listen to my mp3 ;;;;;it's rocking with music;;;;;somebody have the firmware of this phone for mp3 player or another way???? please im going to suicide!!!!!! u_u..... this cell phone is AMAZING but the mp3 is essencial!!!!!!!! please anyboy that could put mp3 or some audio with the same quality pleaze!!!! greeting from peru ^___^;;;;;if you cannot received call. try to long press the delete button, cause it might be on answerphone mode.;;;;;hey everyone....could u plz help me out in toshiba A5501T that how to change the language in this? plzzzzz;;;;;mm i didnt hear that about the 300kb :S. well that muzt be the size bekause i proove with another formz and that didnt worked. thankz for the info! :D take kare !;;;;;can this model type or read chinese wording??;;;;;I read it can do mp3 ringtones but only under 300k...is this 300kbps quality or 300kb size? as it is pointless for me to buy a phone that does not support mp3 ringtones or ringtones of real music as opposed to polyphonic/midi etc. Thanks;;;;;can anyone help me to open the gprs and mms here in philippines?! i gladly appreciate your response trough email.;;;;;Can I use another GPS software with my phone?;;;;;anyone get the gps of this phone working in malaysia or own country.. email me;;;;;i have 1 toshiba 903t and i can't listen music mp3 someone can help me? how I make to place the musics in mp3 in my 903t? my email:phantomano@hotmail.com or phantomano123@hotmail.com thanks;;;;;yeah boy its a very cool fone! its easy on pc sync mp3 to 3gp ;;;;;Battery time too low have to charge on daily basis, cam is too good design style are just perfect.

Code required will be simply 1234. then, check your network settings. It should give you Smart Internet Smart GPRS Smart MMS
 
These settings can be viewed but cannot be edited.
 
Reboot your phone then try the Vodafone Live! link in your browser...it should lead you to smart's home page.

 
Try other sites such as google and yahoo and it should work. if you have questions text me at 09286570631

DO NOT use the phone to browse the site. it will waste your time and your load as well. lastly, for music stuff, unfortunately, the phone can't read mp3s - only 3gp, amr, midi, and smf. so just bear with its low quality sound or sell the phone if you are not satisfied. anyhow as for me it's still a very nice phone. ^_^;;;;;hi again, i have read the posts from other 902t users, and I think i can help you with some concerns.  in regard to downloading games, try to get them at these sites:  www.getjar.com  wap.getjar.com  uncleallevil.republika.pl  sharp_902.republika.pl do not save them on memory card, use phone memory instead. It won't allow you to save games on memcard for reasons that i don't know. don't worry though, the phone has lots of space good enuff for maybe 10+ games (or even 20 i guess). I only have 5 with me and I enjoy playing them. 
default password of 902t in case you do not know is 9999. you should try these passcode if you need to master rest the phone. please refer on my previous posts on how to setup your 3g to enjoy downloading games and browsing stuff through this mobile phone (NOTE: smart users only - no globe).
 
as for bluetooth, unfortunately u can only use blutooth for sending contacts and notes. but for sending pix and other stuff, you can only use MMS or Infrared. You can receive pix via BT but you won't be able to send using it. 
 
as for USB issues, i do not have a USB cable with me. what I use to transfer stuff is a memcard reader, and OTA - for downloading stuff online.
 
hope this post helped you in someway. my contact 09286570631. i do not answer nos. from TM, globe or sun.

The technician said that it had to be reprogram but unfortunately they still dont have the software to reprogram it until now.;;;;;My inquiry is about my toshiba phone vodafone 902t.. i turned it on tha sreen just displayed th meassage DB_ERR..and now i cant use it anymore.. pls help me...  Althea;;;;;can anyone help me find a software to reprogram my toshiba phone. the technicians says that it needs to be reprogram but still now they dont have the software to reprogram my phone. please help me i really love this phone together with my k800i phone;;;;;I am beginning to love my phone despite of its shortcomings when it comes to playing mp3 files. I had a chance to download lots of games and apps, and the phone works wonders. Imagine playing 3d games on this phone for hours - if you are aware if Fishlab games (awesome 3d java games), and also adventure games from gameloft, and even the old school games like space invaders, atari games, even street fighter of snes...my phone's heating while playing but its fine! its normal. although my current music files has low bitrate, while im using it in my office still the loudspeaker sounds ok and not that distorted unlike if you use earphones on it.  you'll love this phone eventually, just learn its capabilities and go with the flow.;;;;;oh! i forgot. if any 1 can hepl me to convert ma mp3s to wat ever ie is that will allow it to b played, pleez do. ramshandani@hotmail.com;;;;;hey peeps. i got a ts921 that i got from japan but am now in jamaica(the land with black men with stiff dicks) and am abit dissapointd. i wz lookin faword to havin a phone that cud play mp3s only to find out that it cant. i wz readin up on the fone and saw sumtin about convertin from mp3s to ....... to sumtin else, i dont remembr rite now but i really wanna hear music on ma fone. can sum1 help me to go about this. i REALLY need this. RAMISH is in distress!!!;;;;;helle ppl, it's me again. For SMART3G users, to unleash the phone's 3g capabilities, register your phone as N90, and it should work. Vodafone Live! menu will be enabled and it'll lead you to SMART's homepage. For detailed instructions: - SET 3G N90 (send to 211) - GPRS ON (send to 333) - MMS ON (send to 333) As for everyone's concern regarding playing music files...someone suggested to convert mp3s to 3GPs to play them. I've tried that ImTOO software thingy and sad to say, i am not satisfied with the results. 3GP files have a very low bitrate - PROS: if you have a 1gb sd card, you can store LOTS of music files  CONS: WORST SOUND QUALITY EVER!
 
on the camera, it's fine I have no comments on that. Unfortunately, this phone is not mp3 capable, which is not for me - I browse, i download, i record, i play. that's me as a mobile phone user. 
 
anyone interested on my phone, i've posted it on eBay.ph you might want to look at them. It has been gmasked for a unique look - from matte black to striped red.;;;;;how can i use the internet on this handset? tnx....;;;;;hi dee, i'm from philippines as well.. i just want to ask where did you buy this unit?.. i'd like to have a vodafone as well.. :D thank you!..;;;;;this is a good phone however, i dont know how to play mp3s. it says that files are  invalid.;;;;;I bought this phone recently (it is a vodafone 902t from japan), and I agree that as far as functionality and features are concerned, i had a good deal (I got them at 7k php with 1gb sd card, all the manuals, the cradle, charger, utility tools, tv out, headset, and box all in japanese characters). one thing's missing, usb cable. anyway, what i found out GOOD on this phone is it's cam and vid features.  As I was reading every user's opinion with regard to this phone, I hate the fact that it is not mp3 capable (if you disagree, i'll be happy to take your advice on how to play mp3s on this phone). I tried one of the advice here wherein u need to transfer them to ur SD card, but unfortunately, my fone cant read'em. One thing I would like to ask all of you ppl, ""if i'm going to convert an mp3 to a 3gp file, does the sound quality will be affected also? and is it guaranteed that it'll work fine? if so, where can I get an mp3->3gp/amr converter software? which quality is better, amr or 3gp?"" Another thing i noticed...i love the fact that you can browse internet using its 3g features but, everytime i download stuff it says ""contents error."" why is it so? Does it have to do with its settings? (I am from cavite...Smart line) Google's fine, as of the other sites like yahoo, or even smart's homepage, it says ""contents error.""  so...two things i need help: - mp3to3gp or amr extension - browsing i'll be open for your advices, comments, suggestions, or even reaction if there is.. u can text me 0921 9291183 or email me at hiei_64@yahoo.com

Don't know why this model isn't that popular, it not the greatest looking phone but for the price and for what your getting, it equivelent to the sharp 902 at about half of the price.

V903T looks the same but a lil'bit cooler , also more features;;;;;2 a2yd : sorry 2 disappoint u ... there is noway dat u can flash de firmware, as the fact dat dis isnt a popular model, so nobody wil do it 4 u n u cant really do anything about it now  2 those who wants to put mp3 : if ur ts921 comes wit a cd-rom ""beat-engine"" then u jus simply follow the steps instal dat program n u can add in mp3 2 ur sd card easily , the other way is to use sd adaptor thru usb n connect 2 ur pc n u wil see a new drive , u wd need 2 format it first , then copy n paste the mp3 songs in2 dis folder (PRIVATE / VODAFONE / MyItems /Sounds & Ringtones) ... dis works wit the japanese version so the eu version ts921 shud work as wel;;;;;I have a hacked japanese vodafone version.

Thanks.;;;;;Free Vodafone Toshiba TS803 USB driver download (English version with connectivity software): Link:   Easy way to play MP3: 1. Format your SD card first using your Toshiba TS803 2. Do not use Beat Engine software to transfer music, because itll encrypt your MP3 files and if you change SIM, you will no longer be able to play those songs. Also it'll no longer be in ""MP3"" format so that you won't be able to play it in another device. 3. Now after connecting USB cable, go to the menu Settings >> Connectivity >> USB >> and here select Music transfer mode in your mobile. Now youll see a new drive in My Computer in your PC. 4. Go to that drive, and go to the folder like M:\PRIVATE\VODAFONE\My Items\Sounds & Ringtones. And here is the most important trick that is DO NOT create any folder under a folder in it. That is you can create a folder named John Denver under the folder Sounds & Ringtones but DO NOT create any folder under John Denver folder. Only you can put MP3 files under John Denver folder.
 
5. You can create another folder named George Michel under Sounds & Ringtones folder. Just copy and paste MP3 files in it. Nothing else. And so on. IF YOU PUT ANY MP3 FILES OTHER THAN UNDER THE FOLDER  Sounds & Ringtones, YOU WONT BE ABLE TO PLAY IT. This is the trick. Also make sure your mp3 files bit stream is not more than 192kbps.

Mp3 is clear and loud. Message input is easier after getting used to it.  -------------- I spent a few hours trying to transfer my mp3 files using beatbox. I transferred all my songs except some. (phone says file can't be played). ANYWAY- before tranferring music files, you install beatbox software. NEXT, you make sure to install all usb drivers using the cd). THEN, from beatbox software, you have to set your mobile number. (this can be changed if you switch usim cards).  ALSO set your mobile number in your phone under CONTACTS. ---then connect your phone using the USB.  
while its connected to the computer, go to SETTINGS on your phone, and then CONNECT(USB). Set it to music transfer. (Dont worry about the offline thing.) 
 
Then open beatbox software. You can add all your mp3 files to library. Then, transfer to your phone.  
WHEN you are done, go to file on beatbox and quit. 
 
then disconnect your phone.  
MP3 files should be able to play. Some files can't play eg: files that have 96kbps can't be played.;;;;;pls help me...i downloaded already mp3s and then i converted those into .tbd using beat engine box software but still those files could not be played. what can i do so that i can play mp3s in my T803 phone...pls give me advice..thanks!!!;;;;;great Phone But huge - Cable of NEC N8 & Charger is the same as this one! - No need for cable if you have Beat Engine Software, just download MP3 the convert to .TBD then copy to Card Reader. **NOTE: in the software you must enter your SIM Phone #. when SIM is replaced the phone will not Play music. - Video can be used as Rigntone but not .TBD files, for mine that is. - Anyone know where to DL Chinese Firmware? thanks ;;;;;jason, i have also a t803 phone.I bought it from my friend but it has no cable included wer can I buy a cable here in the philippines? cause i cannot also play my mp3s in my phone..i downloaded already the beat engine box but it needs to have a cable to convert the mp3..;;;;;can it handle 1gb mini sd?;;;;;Where is the camera of this Ugly phone?;;;;;Can sumone help me..  is this phone compatible with wireless headphone i mean blutoot headphone.. the A2DP technology?? how can i activate it?? pls help.. thnx...;;;;;val!!!kailangan mo ng software beat engine box. convert mp3 to tbd file.u hav to connect ur cellphone sa PC tru usb cable.then, follow instructions lng sa software.okies;;;;;preng jason, i have the same prob... i can't also play any mp3 in my phone... can you help me also? but sadly i'm here in japan right now...;;;;;me. wer u from?u hav to use beat engine box software to convert ur mp3 files to tbd.okies.if ur from philippines txt na lng tau. leave ur number para i can help u.okies.:);;;;;i have a beat engine software.

Maybe it only plays original mp3's or something, and not pirated music.;;;;;rizla : wat u mean by wat kind of files ? do u mean music files or tx files ?  n70 is a smartfone , it allows u 2 add n remove software in ur fone , but 803 has better music n camera functions. if u want 2 buy a nokia smartfone , go 4 n80 or wait a little longer until n73 n n93 release;;;;;what kind of files can recognise this phone?what is beter nokia n70 or ts803?;;;;;erm van helsing. wat kind of miniSD a u using, brand n size ? cos i hav no problem playing mp3 files from card;;;;;Great phone, video file can use for ringing, great video recording, super mp3, bluetooth, irda, great photos, I am speachless. ;;;;;I didn't try to use the mp3 player at first, but when i did, i couldn't. It doesn't see the mp3s that I put on the card, only very few, which can't be played. Does anyone know why? Does it have a limitation of some sorth? Do the mp3s have to be original or something in order for it to see and play them?;;;;;2 a2yd : sorry i shud make the point dat 902t n ts921 is a lil bit different cos the japanese version doesnt  support mp3 playback .only the 903t or newer does . n no1 had yet solved dis problem ;;;;;I have a question I'm on a 902t and I'm using the beat engine software. For some reason it won't transfer, do you have to use a miniSD card, because I""m on a standerd SD. Any help be appricated;;;;;mp3 ringtone is possible , but u wil need 2 get it unlocked 1st . orelse the easy way is 2 convert mp3 in2 mmf format , which is simple 2 do . some ppl think the fonebk is a mess jus cos they arent used 2 the japanese style , but myself i was a nokia user , at the beginning it was like hell, but quickly got used 2 it :);;;;;it does not play mp3 ringtones, unless you record the song with the microfone in the phone.... no autofocus and phone book is a mess in no alphabetical order;;;;;van helsing ... altho the ts921 has got AF on the cam but its only 1.92 mpix compare wit 2.26mpix on 803, also ts921 doesnt allow u 2 send any files via bluetooth ...  btw there's a newer version of ts921 in japan which is call v903t , same spec as ts921 but v903t allow bluetooth transfering those who can read japanese can check out dis  ;;;;; I've come back with some details about the camera. In sunlight, pictures taken to objects not too far (a few meters) are very clear, as if it would have autofocus. Objects that are far, like buildings or threes are not so clear, especialy if they don't have direct sunlight. Indoors or in the night, pictures are bad. Colours are great, ""CCD power"" !  The settings available in the menu are great, a lot of small details that together make up quality ( operator name on the screen *yes *no, folder password, different led colours for different warnings, etc.). And the design of the phone is stylish, it looks much better in reality than in the pictures, especialy when it is open, deppending of it's colour.  On the whole, a great phone, a great brand. To those of you who want picture quality i suggest you buy TS 921 model, for it's autofocus.;;;;;Yes, that's true, it doesn't have autofocus. The camera isn't better, it's worse than k750's. The other functions are great, but the camera is no good.;;;;;just wanna make the point dat de cam of dis fone doesnt hav auto-focus ... but the cam is CCD so its better than alot other cam fone already as most brands like SE or nokia are sticking wit CMOS sensor;;;;;Does this phone play mp3 ringtones, have t9, and is the phonebook in alphabetical order?;;;;;www.plemix.com is selling this phone(unlocked) for $279. It's really a great deal. if i didnt buy the samsung D600 2 months ago, i would definitly buy this one. Besides, you can trust plemix.com. I bought D600 from them, it took less than 72 hrs to arrive(about $30 for shipping).;;;;;to Danny, i believe this phone does use mp3 ringtones. The vodafone ireland site says it takes real tones so looks like it does have them.;;;;;Vodafone Ireland are selling this phone 299 for an upgrade or 399 pay as you go. I like everything about this phone. I am due an upgrade in a couple of weeks and it is between this one and the Motorola V3x. I think i will have to get the Motorola as it is half the price and lighter.;;;;;I WANT ONE !!!!!!!!!!!!

It's pretty cool to carry a phone which no one has and it look like an iPod. Most of my friends cannot find where the SIM card is placed.... I give 90 marks for a not expensive, cool, different, light and trendy phone. All cheers.;;;;;Well ive had my phone for over a year. When i first saw it i thought it was cool looking.  Then when i got it out of the box i was shocked to find it was painted plastic !!!!   The 2 weeks later found that I couldn't not buy ANY accessories for it !!  My Vodafone store couldn't  or wouldn't help and said to me what do you want for a cheap phone ? Funny you wanted to sell it to me. !!   Any ways even more miffed when I find that I cant hook it  up to a PC to get all the photos I've taken with it in to the PC to print out !!   Any one know how I can do this ???  as so far NO one can help . Tried Toshiba but after spending 25 mins on the phone getting no where I gave up.  I'm still using it the Phone and taking pictures,  the night time setting is good for very low light photos.  Ring tones are very bad.  Tried recording my own but gave up as the sounds is dismal. 
 
I'm also wondering how do i get the phone to store Incoming Txts to the Phone an don't the sim card ?  Is that even possible ?  The instruction manual is  not very forth coming with info.
 
At least its compact and not heavy.  Even if the battery life is very short !!  an not coming with  a car charger its a real pain !!
 
Well if any one reads this and you can help me out drop me a line  daveinvicta999@yahoo.com.
 
Cheers

Vodafone,Smart E8,";;;;;I have been a vodafone customer for 15 years. I bought this phone for work and it does everything I want it to do. Sim free and cheap phone with lots of functions. Can't complain;;;;;i buy voda smart E8 but it seems its very hard to use specially some of the setting are make my life hard and its delayed slow response. no good;;;;;I bought this phone as a backup or secondary phone but it is taking so long to set up, even as a new phone. Anyone else had this experience?;;;;;For about USD $40 it is a damn good phone. Can even make phone calls!  Awful pics, not even tried vids. Some Apps work but for an Android 7.1 this phone gets ""May not work on your device"" warnings and some bigger Apps failing to download at all. If you want to take your high end Drone for a fly, forget it but for a quick reply on FB no problems.;;;;;Considering the Qualcomm MSM8909 Snapdragon 210 was only released in 2015 for mid range market it is not 2012 but the basic phone hardware itself has been around the Chinese markets for years. Qualcomm MSM8909 Snapdragon 210 is limited to 720p 8Mp video but this phone barely touches it at 5Mp anyway. Only thing 2017 is the Android version 7.1 Nougat so in a way it is a 2012 phone upgraded for the umpteenth time plus you'll never have to worry about finding a spare battery!;;;;;States 128GB SD card but use a good quality brand UHS-1 U1 or U3 speed class. 64GB UHS -1 U1 should be enough for your phone and a lot cheaper. ;;;;;What is the max. capacity memory SD card this telephone supports?

Vodafone,Smart V8,";;;;;Hi there did you manage to solve the issues with snap chat?  I just bought that phone I've tried to change the navigation settings but the keys don't work either. So snap chat won't work at all, may take the phone Back;;;;;Don't worry about finger print You can make another one. ;;;;;Great all rounder. Well built, very sturdy. Has finger reader on back but won't read my finger! Very fast responsive screen! ;;;;;Battery is non-removable according to the manual.;;;;;How do you ;;;;;Yeah, you can.;;;;;Yeah, you can.;;;;;You can't send snap chats on this phone ;;;;;I have this device for 3 months and it has proven to be a very decent smart phone. It is comparable to the Nokia 6 in performance with a newer chipset the 435. It is a smooth operating phone if not the fastest but it gets the job done no matter what it is used for. The screen is bright and the colours really pop. The 16MP rear and 8MP front cameras are very good and with plenty of manual controls and other photo options. It is all round a far superior device to last year's Ultra 7. If it were sold under any other brand name apart from Vodafone it would be a far more popular device. It is as good as any other lower end mid range phone on the market right now.;;;;;Smart Ultra 6 was a revelation, produced by the Chinese company ZTE. The Smart Ultra 7 was produced by Alcatel for economy reasons i suppose. Poor product. Smart Ultra 8 (V8) produced once again by ZTE. It seems Vodafone learned its lesson. Ultra 8 - Pros: it's a Best Buy, responsive, 32 Gb ROM, 3Gb RAM, Fingerprint reader that works perfectly, superb design, contrast and color photos better than Ultra 6, photos of the subject in motion without streaks behind it, strong volume and bass much beter than Ultra 6. Cons: The pictures are a bit grainy, like the Sony Z1 that I owned before Ultra 6; In low light grains becomes upsetting; The On / Off button is uninspired placed on the left side. The Ultra 6's was on the right side right under the volume. If you turn it on the landscape mode, chances are very high that you will touch this button with your left hand's  big thumb and close the device while playing a game or taking a picture. After 3 weeks, I'm still not used with it. Personally, I would have liked to have touch buttons outside the screen, underneath it as well as Ultra 6. So, it takes 2 steps: One to activate the virtual buttons bar and the second to push them. Besides that, the active screen gets smaller because of the 3 buttons bottom bar. It would be great if the next generation of Ultra, V9 or so, would have dual cam and IP68/69.;;;;;Have had no issues like that. No issues whatsoever.;;;;;not worth the money Vodafone is worth next to nothing if you sell it second hand;;;;;not very compatible with Snapchat app. Anyone experience any issues? Phone navigation keys block some of the snapchat function keys, especially when trying to send.;;;;;Love this phone but does it have a facility for answer phone? I.e. Can someone leave a message? Bought in Spain as live here but don't speak the language therefore the leaflet useless.;;;;;Its not very clear the Radio information, according to the voda shop and i know you should believe that its cat 6 so this or a p9 lite is their any other cheaper phone that does cat 6 im purchasing this phone when my EE mast goes 4g+ and allows you to use 2 xmitters;;;;;FYI:  Vodafone Ireland very recently pushed an o.t.a. 'force' update that cannot be skipped or avoided in any way. That update kills double-tap to wake. It also causes problems with admin right, e.g. fingerprint unlock clashes with Arrow Launcher's double tab to lock feature. Go figure.  Worst of all: I tried 2 V8 devices, and both suffer from significantly poorer 3G/4G reception. Frequent dropped calls where, in 12 years with Vodafone, I never had a single dropped call. Oh, and bizarrely after the update certain Developers Options are enabled by default such as btsnoop hci logging. ALTHOUGH dev options are NOT visible in settings. Result: random and fairly chunky btsnoop_hci.log files - in one instance a 600MB (!!!) after a transfer of 5 ordinary jpegs. Ouch.  Since Vodafone Ireland probably didn't cook up the update, I wonder if UK handsets will have similar problems. ;;;;;where do I buy this phone? Just looking at my options;;;;;Can it make video call?;;;;;why has the contact and messages aps disappeared from the front screen?;;;;;Bought this and unlocked on eBay, nice big multi color notification LED on it. Very fast and nice alternative to a Nokia 6.

Lol;;;;;I'm sure we can root it soon ;;;;;Got one this morning , used to have an iPhone 6 , had to sell due to circumstances, had a budget smart 7 prime which was a bit rubbish, but so far this phone is awesome , really fast , does every thing the iPhone did just as well if not better , very happy at the second but will have to see in next few weeks if there are any problems but so far really very happy with it ;;;;;I am see stats at gsmarena my friend so i said my opinion.  Thats not clueless but clever. I am able to read :-);;;;;This looks like a very decent upgrade to last year's Smart Ultra 7 which was a very good device. I'm getting this device in a few days and can't wait to test it out.;;;;;Don't know phone, not available in country. How do you know it's definitely a good phone then?

Vodafone,Smart N8,";;;;;The serious design flaw with this handset is that the power button is a third of the way down the right hand side of the phone, about exactly where your right thumb naturally rests when making/ receiving a call. I've lost count the times I've been in mid-call and then accidentally disconnected by inadvertently touching this button. Why not have the end-call button on-screen and the power button out of the way like an iPhone. Other than that I can live with it for the £80 I paid.;;;;;I think Vodafone is the best very easy to access I can just do without it . the management teams should continue with there good work . God bless.;;;;;The second on I've owned.  The first was stolen.  For the price with all the features it unbeatable.  As for it being locked to voda? it's easily unlocked.;;;;;My niece looked into phones for me as I am not very good with new devices. She has chosen very well indeed for me. Thanks Alicia.;;;;;You can't beat it for the price, I have bought 12 of them for our fleet of drivers.;;;;;It's a terrible phone. Terrible. They managed to skip water resistance, and mine has already been water damaged. I'd just buy a Galaxy S5, even if you don't get Android 7.0. Also, this phone is stuck to Vodafone, therefore they put lots of their own bloatware on to the device's 16GB storage. Even then, there is no sign that this phone is getting Android 8.0. Most of the time, the bloatware (especially VF Accessories) takes forever to recompile to work on the latest version. The performance? It's not so good. It has a low-end MediaTek processor, which is fine for games like opsu! (an open-source version of the already open-source osu!) but in Minecraft, the render distance is limited to... 6 chunks. That's not that much.;;;;;Had a galaxy x cover 3 prior. This is better in all aspects except for not being waterproof. 1.5gig of ram was a concern but so far has not been a problem. Camera is better than the xcover in that it is clearer not so blurry. Screen is retina dislay quality and rom at 16gig gives about 10gig free for apps. ;;;;;Have not been able to unlock the phone since I got it. Have been operating on it with wireless network. Now the screen got broken 2days ago and can't get where to fix it please help me out o;;;;;my vodaphone n8 cuts out sound to my callers ,had it sent away 3 times for repair ,alright when it came back then didn't work again after a few days . vodaphone then gave me a new n8 , had it for about 9 days and now this ones done the same thing grrrrr.;;;;;First of all, this is a brilliant phone. It has optimal performance and a good battery. I was playing games for 4 hours and it didn't even break a sweat.;;;;;Ok. I hear you talk about updates. I just wanna know the quality of the pictures.;;;;;Nope, not getting this one. Smart Prime 6 never got an update. Its hardware is only a tiny bit better, but costs more than double. Fingerprint scanner won't save it;;;;;Why people are whining about updates... Based on past experience they will only release 3 security patches, then trash the phone. Smart Prime 6 only got 2 security updates in 2 years. Phone shipped with 5.0.2 in 2015, it's still on that version;;;;;Why are people whining so soon about no updates?  The phone was only released in June 2017.  The N8 I used had an OTA update on 31st of August to 7.0-120FCN1.;;;;;Wouldn't get this even if they gave me money to have it. No support, no updates, no nothing.;;;;;Please not buy. Firmware download=not, tehnical support=not, product is ""alcatel""?  Just name alcatel, alcatel romania decline this product. Vodafone ...support have not suuport and have not link to product alcatel. Update...NEVER. please do not buy alcatel, philips, e-boda, allview, prestigio brand. If is vodafone branded, buy zte, qualcomm or other real brand. For example, vodafone smart ultra 6 (zte name is vodafone 995n),  firmware, suport and 4 update from android 5.0.1 to 6.0.1;;;;;nope, not getting that. Not even the fingerprint scanner can lure me to get another Vodafone, I'd rather get the Galaxy J3.;;;;;good to know.;;;;;Oh dear me...part of Smart Ultra 6 touch screen failed after 10 months, preventing part of the keyboard working. Took it to Vodafone for repair, who examined the externals very closely and found NO damage (I always kept in a case covering back and front of phone) before sending for repair. Vodafone now tell me the fix is chargeable (£70+) despite still being well within warranty. This phone is built to a price, as are it's successors (Smart Ultra 7, N8 and on). I wouldn't choose this phone or it's successors if I was buying again...specs good, great when it's working, but simply not robust enough for my real world use. My experience of Vodafone after sales service is worse than disappointing... A 4* phone, with Vodafone after sales customer service feeling more like an abdication than a service;;;;;good to have;;;;;just realized that Vodafone produced smartphone;;;;;better then 10 time moto E4, redmi 4 $70 ","[datetime.date(2018, 3, 10), datetime.date(2018, 3, 8), datetime.date(2018, 3, 4), datetime.date(2018, 1, 31), datetime.date(2018, 1, 30), datetime.date(2018, 1, 1), datetime.date(2017, 11, 24), datetime.date(2017, 11, 14), datetime.date(2017, 11, 1), datetime.date(2017, 10, 2), datetime.date(2017, 9, 21), datetime.date(2017, 9, 19), datetime.date(2017, 9, 19), datetime.date(2017, 9, 14), datetime.date(2017, 8, 25), datetime.date(2017, 8, 11), datetime.date(2017, 8, 4), datetime.date(2017, 7, 13), datetime.date(2017, 7, 7), datetime.date(2017, 6, 29), datetime.date(2017, 6, 14), datetime.date(2017, 6, 14)]"
Vodafone,Smart Turbo 7,";;;;;I would try and get my mom this. She has a mobicell and it is giving more issues as its a SA own brand.  With Mobiel you cannot update your whatsapp even Would rather go for this .;;;;;I like the phone for the price it works great.I wanted a phone that has fast internet and 4g it works great for me.the camera is poor but it is useable I'd rather have a camera then none at all.if your looking for cheap phone I'd highly reccomend it.;;;;;Bought this phone while I waited for my Samsung to be repaired, Got it for R999-94 (about $71.00) and did not expect fireworks from it as it is a budget phone. I actually liked it, for that little money it is a capable little phone, good screen for price, fast internet and running games like Into the dead and Enemy Strike without a glitch. Battery do take long to charge though. ;;;;;firstly - its a 4 gig storage phone - total storage - and the camera is so poor for a 5 meg camera - I sold my mobicel switch for this , but surely it was na mistake, even tho it had a 512 meg processor;;;;;My god...this phone has THE lowest pixel density (PPI) of ANY Android phone, ever, period!;;;;;Do Not Buy, even if someone gives it to you for free, don't take it. Touch it with wet hands and the touch screen will go crazy for an hour and you won't be able to use the phone. Getting a call while playing music? the phone won't bother to pause the music, so you'll listen to music while on a call. Touch not very responsive.  Camera not that great.;;;;;Lmao seriously don't bother you will regret it but if your up for a challenge format sdcard as internal storage but if you sdcard is slow it will lag like sticky shit on the wall .must use UHS class10 or its gonna hurt. And that sdcard will never be usable in an other device again screw mine up unformatable fully encrypted for that device you have been warned;;;;;I must agree with others what a price of shit iv rooted  this device xposed models don't help greenify bearly makes any difference on battery life keyboard sucks ass it really is dumb slug 7 I wouldn't even want to port another ROM to it as I don't think it would help lmfao $99 I played $98 to much back to my j2 Samsung smart prime 7 could do 1080p fuk sakes lol and that was $100 worth every cent to oh well dig deeper people coz this is an anchor in your pocket;;;;;battery is total rubbish, it charge for long but stays less. then storage is too bad. period ;;;;;This phone is ok. It's not the best phone in the world but there are worse phones out there.Yes, the touchscreen is not total garbage but it is overly sensitive. The internal memory will get filled up VERY quickly. Adding a sim card seems to add nothing to the phone. The only VERY ANNOYING ""feature"" to the phone is the ridge round the edge of the phone which will chop your ear off if you hold the phone next to your ear! A blue tooth headset is required. Or, better still, a better phone!;;;;;you really get what you pay for with this phone. touch screen is absolute garbage. taking deep breaths when texting seems to help this phone not end up in pieces. buyer beware.;;;;;The phone is great, however after charging to 100% of battery, it can hardly go for 8 hours, is there a problem with may battery. I bought the phone last month.;;;;;how does one turn off this phone, keeps rebooting???????;;;;;Go to where the apps are ;;;;;big chance that this comment will be deleted because it's too ruthless but, I am so sick of Vodafone, not only they lack of unlimited mobile data, it's because they don't know how to make good budget phones. Since 2013, my experience with Vodafone's smart phones is a living hell, and since I got the Smart Turbo 7 or should I say the 'Dumb Slug 7', this phone takes the cake. First off, the keyboard is a living hell. It glitches really bad, even the most precise touch and resetting won't help. My other smartphones may be slow and no longer work, but their keyboards are fine. And there's something I don't get, is that this 5 inch phone only displays 480p resolution. The smart prime 6 can display 720p HD quite nicely. Though this phone has 8GB internal storage, even if I have all my files on my SD card, the internal storage is 90% full and no files are even in there. Google Play always notifies me that I  have no storage left. The camera is bad, period. Processing is awful, Pokemon Go won't open.
 
In conclusion, I have found the bottom of the barrel and I have lost respect to Vodafone and all their phones, I don't trust their quote unquote 'faster' smart N8 and all of their other phones. I'd rather switch to cheap chinese phones or go back to the Samsung C3050.;;;;;How do you Turn off talk back.;;;;;When incoming call it rings but cannot slide left to right as no button to do this;;;;;You can download the user manual here -   As long as your phone browser supports pdf files? If not try Firefox browser;;;;;Sounds like you haven't removed the protective blue plastic sheet from the screen. On  the apps and crashing have you turned everything off you don't want with nothing left running in the back ground? If yes then you need to upgrade to probably a £200 plus phone.;;;;;Try Opera mini browser.It works great.;;;;;I've had this phone since Christmas and it's working great. Good screen, great battery, only disappointment is it lacks NFC... But that's a minor problem for me.  I was worried about it being a Vodafone phone, but it is well made and it didn't need unlocking to work to the cheaper talk mobile network. Great starter or second phone.;;;;;I hate the turbo7 its total rubbish. Motorola kindly gave us the moon tech. In the 60's this thing couldn't even download the clip. Rotten! Huawei p9 you're it!;;;;;Please can someone help me, how can you move your apps to your SD card ;;;;;Like larger screen, good 4 utube, e-reading x;;;;;I'm delighted with this smart phone- my first! Thank you Vodafone for giving it to me for cherry points. I'm gradually getting used to using it and it can do so much;;;;;For 49 GBP you can't go wrong.  Seems quite well made and works perfectly well.;;;;;Pretty rubbish phone, screen is terrible you have to have it directly facing you to see it properly.. Dark parts of images are very hard to see. Scrolling is very slow, the precision of the touch screen is also bad. Its also pretty slow and force closes apps all the time, can't keep apps open without having to restart them and struggles to keep a few web pages open which is annoying.  Definitely avoid and get something else. Cheap for a reason. ;;;;;I have it, three days older in my possession but the big problem i have discovered  is the poor battery. It takes long to charge and it stays for less than 6hrs;;;;;so far am liking this phone.... for it's price it's worth it..  ;;;;;Ican not see how Vodafone can charge £11.00 more than Argos for the Vodafone turbo smart 7 and nothing to show how to used it.;;;;;I know but if your willing get a charger with power IQ it has helped me immensely;;;;;I just buying before 2 weeks,this phone have lot of problem,take long for battery charge, battery backup also low,when I make video call in 5 minute phone is so hot,browsing speed low,not working nicely all apps,app permission apps making tomuch problem.my money is worst with this phone;;;;;Just bought this phone about a month ago already its just presses itself after unlocking it REALLY DISAPPOINTED just waste of money;;;;;I bought the phone 1 week after its release everything about it is perfect except for the battery, the battery don't last longer and it  takes forever to charge it  because it don't have fast charge technology and u must install one to charge it faster. Very bad phone;;;;;Lol why so little people interested in this phone it have decent specs it beats the Samsung galaxy j1 mini LTE via price point and others in the class it got really good chipset Mediatek MT6735M Quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53 Mali-T720MP2 ;;;;;have you never you never used a phone before? just tap on the messages button, its on the homescreen;;;;;Unrootable with Kingo or Kingroot etc... alot like a Moto, without all the jokerola apps...

Vodafone,Smart Platinum 7,";;;;;This is a known issue, it seems that this phone has an issue with the motherboard. You'll have to take it to the voda store for repair;;;;;Don't buy this phone. Multiple cases of rebooting loops after 6 months to a year of use. Same happend to me and the smallest dent or scratch will make vodafone say it's out of warranty. And because it's a vodafone only phone no one else can repair it. It would have been an amazing phone. But this issue just renders it as a terrible product that will leave you stranded without a phone and a 2 year contract. ;;;;;I have to say this is the worst phone i have ever had, I really regret getting it. Unfortunately I'm stuck in a 2 year contract with it. Its already been into the repair shop because I couldn't make calls, the photos were terrible quality, I couldn't get on the internet. It would dial other people while I was in the middle of a phone call. All of this by the time it was 6 months old, I was given a new sim card as they couldn't tell me what was actually wrong with it. Now I can be seconds into a phone call and it will just cut me off. Absolute rubbish!!!!;;;;;This is probably vodafones best phone....but theres no updates whatsoever. Yes the update button is there, but its function has the same use as north korea to the rest of the world. Can it be...theres a 73.4mb update...bug fixes...nougat?;;;;;Terrible Phone. steer clear. The back camera lens glass cracked in the first week. And this voided my Vodafone Ireland warranty when the main circuit board failed after 6 months. And Vodafone Ireland and their repair contractors won't confirm the reason for the main board failure so I can't claim on my insurance as they need a reason for the cause of loss. Steer clear of Vodafone Ireland;;;;;For me its an hidden gem. Front facing stereo speakers, QuadHD OLED display, ARM A-72 cores for fast single-thread performance, fingerprint sensor, 32GB ROM and 3GB RAM. One cannot find many devices with these caracteristics. (doubt me? go on phone finder and activate ""OLED display, stereo speakers and fingerprint sensor"". Spoiler: there's only 15 devices.) The build quality is good, feels like a premium device when holding and using. The OS is clean, almost vannila android. The downsides: not so premium cameras and OS doesn't upgrade. For the price this device is unmatched. BlackBerry DTEK60 is a good alternative, packing the same features but for an higher price.
 
PS: I might be lucky since im not experiencing any battery problems that other people complain.;;;;;Worst phone I've ever had, camera is poor quality, has to be turned on and off to change over from WiFi to mobile data, slightest knock and it cracks. Got this phone based on reviews from tech geek sites on contract 12 months ago and it fell off the sofa onto wooden floor and smashed into a million pieces, so had to go back to old phone. Trust me this phone is nothing like the branded phones.;;;;;Will be updated to Android 7.0?;;;;;A budget phone that looks and feels, and for me,performs like a flagship model. I've read somewhere that it isn't fast enough for intense graphics gaming. I don't play those sort of games, so can't comment. The most graphically intense thing I do on it is watch Netflix and stuff in the BBC iPlayer. It's well up to that task. The sound quality without any external speaker or headset is the best I've heard. Handles online banking, spreadsheets, docs, pics, movies very smoothly. The camera is fine for me, but it might bother some that there is no auto focus. I love it.;;;;;For screen try the alcatel idol 4/4s android and wondows model screen, both the vodafone and alcatel is TLC Brands!;;;;;Try alcatel idol 4/4s android and windows model screen. There is a seller on ebay!;;;;;Smashed the screen and no where can seem to supply screens to fix it... Vodafone want £99. I own it outright so back to my Vodafone smart ultra 6. If anyone knows where I can get an LCD for the vfd900 please let me know!;;;;;Great phone, just the problem with the battery. Had the same problem, constant bootloop unless plugged in. Bought a new one from China and it works now.;;;;;The same happened with me, today i took it to a Vodafone store to replace the battery Hope it works;;;;;Had the same issues (random shutdowns and reboot loops). Everything was solved with a battery replacement under Warranty.;;;;;Hi, Try this:   I was reading about VF phones for the first time & have decided I'd try with one. So I got to VF Smart Platinum 7 and it reminded me of my Note Edge. I had the same problem. It was about the time when the warranty was due to expire. There is one crucial difference, though. The Smart Platinum appears to have a non-removable battery. I have never had such a phone, so this is only a wild guess. See if someone can open it and replace the original battery with a non-VF battery. I have a feeling manufacturers put such commands in batteries to make you purchase a new one. Good luck!;;;;;For no apparent reason my voda smart platinum 7 mobile is resetting when it deems to. I did soft and hard reset but occasionally it still restarts on its own. I have loads of free space and currently using d latest software. The only apps I use are whatapp, chrome and one drive apart from the preinstalled apps. Any suggestions?;;;;;Ok, there was another update 28 MB a few days ago that fixed the heating and battery drain issue. The phone works fine again.;;;;;After this update my phone is getting hot while just browsing or texting on whatsapp or using satnav. Battery life got worse. Bad update, I don't recommend it.;;;;;I got this phone earlier this year 2016 working fine and all ...very slippery though  but few days back it just kept restarting after a long call. I've tried factory resetting and even hard reset but it still keeps restarting. i figured i need to completely flash the phone but i can't find the firmware anywhere online for download could you please upload and and email me the link ... i really don't want to loose my money like this ;;;;;Just install any dialer app you want and disable the Vodafone one. It's as simple as that. I've done it this way and now I use Google dialer.;;;;;My batterylife greatly improved too great phone i used to own s7 edge but this vodafone can compete ;;;;;I have this happening on my Moto G4 Play. I don't think there is a way to remove the orange bars. This happens on Stock Android Marshmallow.  Maybe try installing a custom rom?;;;;;Love this phone but find the design for making calls very confusing. Its a Vodofone phone, so I can't use the Google software to make calls and manage contacts. The installed contacts software is really badly designed. I can't access or edit contact information from the dialer. Is there an app that I can download that'll replace this? Thanks;;;;;Any way to get rid of this horrible orange? I'd like to leave it on battery save mode, but the thing goes bright orange. Never had a phone do this, and its really annoying. So I leave it off, and the battery goes down quickly. Any way to change this? Its a good phone, but this annoys me. Thanks;;;;;""Regulatory & Safety"" it was before this update too, but I noticed a very important battery life improvement, very good. The google security patch is from 5 january;;;;;Ok, I have installed the update after all. Not many changes are visible to the user but I have noticed 2 changes straight away. There's a new section in settings menu named ""Regulatory & Safety"" where you can actually see who made the phone (TCL), a full manufacturer address, CU Reference, Blutooh declaration and a few certification logos. But more important is the second change - camera focus finally has been improved a little bit!;;;;;There's an update available in the UK. 653.7 MB although it's still android 6.0.1. I haven't installed it it. Has anyone tried? ;;;;;Powersave if you don't using heavy games.....but the only way to find out what's best for you is to try all setings...I use performance not for gamea but I like speed ;)....the batery is to good anyway;;;;;what is best for battery? cpu governor interactive or on demand? from stock is interactive;;;;;Don't know about that...I'm a driver and for me is good that increasing volume 'cause if the phone rings louder it scares me :) Anyone noticed in the ""developer option"" there is an ""CPU governor"" with 5 different settings??very usefull This phone almost doesn't need root 'cause it has all you need...many tricks and sets....and this days you don't need root for adds blocker;;;;;yes with this app work very good!! thnaks! ringtones volume back to normal!:) just i hope this app to not reduce battery;;;;;There's a free apk in any app store calles ""disable increasing ring""...works perfect!you can set the volumes for ringtones;;;;;nice phone guys but plz how to disable increasing ringtone volume? is too low and i cant hear it!:(;;;;;I have mobile upgrade q 5.0.6. installed on my pc...and the last in devices list is VFD 900.look carefuly;;;;;plz can you tell me what software exactly to download from alcatel to to reset platimum7 ?i tried 5.0.6 but i dont find vdf900;;;;;Go to alcatel website...you will find Mobile Upgrade Software.it's a PC software.s earch variant 5.0.6..install it on your PC.open devices list.last is VDF900...select and read carrefully the steps to resoft your phone...cheers;;;;;So I bought this phone....great phone,great price.....after one week I can tell you this: camera is indeed dissapointing...not the camera itself but the software of the camera.After I installed snapcamera apk the results are waaaay better!!!Another good news is that Alcatel offers a software for PC for upgrade/resoft this device..(good to know) Overall the phone is excelemt...jbl speakers very loud&clear but the waves maxxaudio is hidden in sound setings and you have to make a lot of steps to get into it. Display is amazing and it has lots of option. Fingerprint reader...great job! Battery...preety good... Quality of materials...flagship!!! Procesor...more than enough... Compare to OP3...hmmmmm....if you like hard games..take OP3...if You like quality multimedia,browsing or social media platinum7 is better than OP3 This realy is a FLAGSHIPKILLER!;;;;;1500lei;;;;;Thanks...that's good news...'cause I wanted to buy idol4s but is more expensive.but if platinum7 has maxxaudio I will buy this......reversible is a feature from idol series wich allows you tu use the phone in any position...even upside-down;;;;;Yes it has max audio,  not sure what you mean about it been reversable ;;;;;Does this phone have maxxaudio app like alcatel idol 4?and it's reversible?;;;;;There's a reason why the phone starts ringing quietly and you can't change it in settings. It's a security feature because there are front facing speakers, pretty good and loud ones. You can find the same feature in other phones with front facing speakers (for example Motorola).;;;;; Change the length of time before calls go to voicemail Your Vodafone mobile is set to ring for 15 seconds before going to voicemail, but you can change how long it rings for, choosing from 5 to 30 seconds in 5 second intervals. To choose your desired ringing time: ÂEnter **61*121*11* on your Vodafone mobile ÂChoose the number of seconds youÂd like your phone to ring for, followed by #, and then ÂPress ÂcallÂ ÂA message will pop up to confirm the new ring time has been set.;;;;;Provide Your number and i can give you a call for this mobile for rooming ;;;;;thank you for that i will try that. i agree with you it does not ring long anough before it goes to voicemail ;;;;;thank you for that i will try that. i agree with you it does not ring long anough before it goes to voicemail ;;;;;I had the same problem, just posted a way of making them louder.;;;;;For those saying the ringtone is quite low, yes I agree. But after a little perservence I now have the ring tone how I like it. (Nice and loud!!!) First of all, it gets louder the longer you let it ring, but in my case it went to voice mail before it got loud, so I googled how to make voice mail activate later, followed the instructions and set the voice mail to activate after 30 seconds and now the ringtone gets progressively  louder!!! Also downloaded a app called ""disable increasing ring"" this allows the ringtone to start loud and stay loud. It is free, but only for a trial period, then you have to pay. This was my only gripe about the phone, now I can hear the phone ring I am very happy, but why you can't do this in the phones settings is strange. Brilliant phone, very fast, good screen, and fantastic for vr!;;;;;try going on zedge and downloading ring tones off there i often do this and they are loud enough for me. hope this helps ;;;;;i have buy a vfd 900 but now is bricked on logo, please need firmware;;;;;Ringtones are very very low .Cant really hear it in a pocket;;;;;yes;;;;;could any one tell me please how does the ring tones sound and are they loud inough to here them as i am a bit deaf many thanks;;;;;could any one tell me please how does the ring tones sound and are they loud inough to here them as i am a bit deaf many thanks;;;;;What is the price for it Unlocked in Romania?;;;;;is it worth it ;;;;;Does this phone have a torch light included ?;;;;;Where can i buy it in Tanzania? ;;;;;Find it @ Makro R5999;;;;;Hi there. Where can I buy the Vodafone Smart Platinum 7 Cellphone in Cape Town, South Africa please? THANK YOU.;;;;;Yes it is comparable with a vr headset;;;;;What about FM radio?;;;;;when will it be available in indonesia??;;;;;Ok, I got mine in september, from Vodafone Romania. My contract is 39E/mounth, so they give it to me for free. I got to say, I love this phone. It looks spectacular, with glass back, and metal edges. Though I have a tiny problem, it slide in the hand pretty easy, but this is expected because it made in glass all over. The phone works great, and fast, with his pure Android, the Vodafone intervention is optional. The sound in built in speakers, and headspeakers is amazing, and you can customize it. Camera though, is not at the same level, could been better. Well I am not a phone picture fan, I prefer my DSLR. All in one, is a very good phone, and don't forget is cheap, or even better, is free.;;;;;Is it available here in Philippines?;;;;;Hello Nic you didn't finish your comment which should have ended ... anything ..;;;;;Sorry for my bad English. I bought this phone, last week-end, at Black Friday, from a Vodafone dealer, in Bucharest, for 100 euro. This phone it's really amazing...;;;;;I really don't know all this - you guys are Top;;;;;I don't know;;;;;When its on a table to check time or notifications.... Anyway i have it already and i have to say he is a beast of a phone;;;;;It has got fingerprint reader, why do you want the double tap .. ;;;;;O think it does not wake up with double tap..... ;;;;;Vodafone Smart Platinum 7 is half of price top brands...;;;;;Does this phone have double tap to wake?;;;;;Do you know where I can buy this phone in Australia or I can ship it from the other country? I bought a Samsung s6 currently, it costs a lot for nothing...;;;;;Not for free, but for 50% of the price on a carrier offer while onePlus ain't available for sale in my country and carrier. That's a solid reason 2 get it. Plus the fact that dwice the specs is only the RAM, the rest is sometimes better, but i couldn't really call it twice. And i really don't like devices without a sd-card slot;;;;;Lol, I guess you never heard of the Oneplus 3, it's twice the spec for the same price..... Vodafone for Life lol.... whatever you say.;;;;;But you could buy the OnePlus 3 for the same price... You are crazy to buy this phone unless you are getting it for free on contract or something..;;;;;I got mine a week ago and though I was skeptical beforehand, switching from Sony Xperia Z3, I can assure you, this is a awesome handset. The Smart Platinum 7 is not perfect by all means but watch this space, as I believe the Xperia range entered in similar fashion and were disregarded for so long and look at their progress and achievements thus far. The Platinum 7 features a well balanced package, has an great look and feel to it and being a critic myself, I know that if Vodafone commit themselves to improve on this allready-great-handset , the future for the Smart series looks promising. A step in faith will reward any new Platinum 7 owner with hours of joy.;;;;;Hi, I'm From India can i get this in our Country i like this phone very much now i have decided to buy these handset so i want to know that the handset is avilable or not India and what is the Exact cost to buy..and also ask to who have already use this handset what is the performance to access... Thank You all ..;;;;;So many things wrong in that comment.;;;;;There should be a review for the device;;;;;There should be a review for the device;;;;;I Love This Phone... Its a Beast... Compared To Other Phones In Its Price Class... Vodafone For Life!;;;;;Absolutely amazing phone, speakers are beautiful for a phone, screen is quick and very responsive, excellent ram and m memory and octocore processor, gets a but warm with use liked most do now.  I cannot fault this phone!!;;;;;@Leandro, I had the exact same doubts being a Vodafone Viva client. I chose this one for it's superior AMOLED screen! The P9 Lite will have better support in the future, being a Huawei, and it's cheaper using the Vodafone points. It's also slightly smaller which I also prefer. Again, the only reason I took the Platinum was due to the AMOLED. I had an Ultra 6 and the Platinum is considerably better ;;;;;Thanks Nochnoi. Im thinking about this or P9 Lite. Wich one you recomend?;;;;;what is the lens type of the 16gb camera ? is it sony , if yes wich one ?;;;;;@LeandroPT No lags with the GPS at all. Sometimes it loses signal for a small period. What you fo have to do is Force Stop the app after about 2 hours of intensive use, it seems it fills some buffer or whatever. BTW I'm also in Portugal;;;;;Does anyone here play pokemon go wiht Vodafone Smart Platinum7  Does it run well? Any lags with the GPS? Thank you;;;;;love u ;;;;;Anyone know a place to get an unlock code for this?I have checked ebay but there is nothing. i dont want to wait 30 days for vodafone to unlock it haha;;;;;Great! Thank you for the reply! Think i will go for the SP7 thanks!;;;;;Depends what you're looking for and where you live. You can get Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 with the same specs cheaper than the Vodafone Smart Platinum 7 but if you live in the UK and want to take advantage of 4G network that can be a little problem because Xiaomi phones don't support LTE band 20 (800 Mhz). If you want a good multimedia device with front facing speakers then the Vodafone SP7 is the best value when we consider closest new competitors: Alcatel Idol 4S which is a very similar but more expensive device and ZTE Axon 7 which is more powerful and more expensive as well but hard to get as for now. Also you can get last year's but still overpriced HTC M9. Considering all above I have chosen and ordered Vodafone SP7 today. Currently I'm waiting for the delivery ;) And don't worry about a simlock. Vodafone can unlock it for free if you apply for it on their website.;;;;;Do you think it is worth getting this or is there any other similar phones that are cheaper?;;;;;Alcatel's product has been released and you can buy it same as the vodafone. They are basically the same phone;;;;;The idol 4s does have a fingerprint reader. This phone is virtually the exact same as the idol 4s. They both even come with VR headsets.;;;;;GSMarena when is possibile a rewiev whith this phone? Pls.;;;;;This is Alcatel Idol 4s, same phone, just different name. ;;;;;is there any unlocked version (non-contract) or international edition of this phone? and does it available with dual sim version? but I don't want alcatel version :);;;;;yes  ! like it;;;;;Yes it is;;;;;"">;;;;;Please tell me, It's available in Africa? I really like it.;;;;;Its not dual sim ...;;;;;It is better than Idol 4s because it has fingerprint but Idol 4 doesn't.;;;;;It does indeed ship with a vr headset! ;;;;;I am a Vodafone employee who has been extensively playing around and testing the device and I can say it is fantastic, now it isn't as high spec as the Samsung's and the Sony's of the world but it is fantastic for the price point! Very premium feeling too and if her print reader is super quick nearly as fast as the Nexus 6p.;;;;;Great phone, it would have been greatest if it packed snd820 and all its features. Maybe put some more juicy on battery n ram.;;;;;its just a  rebranded alcatel idol 4s (vodafone uses stock android, good)   ;;;;;Are you high on crack? The Idols are already released;;;;;Yes but you cannot buy the Alcatel idol 4s as it is the Vodafone smart platinum 7. That's why alcatels device was never released despite being announced at the start of the year. If you wanted alcatels device you will have to get the Vodafone smart platinum 7. Most of the bloatware can be deleted and the rest can be disabled.;;;;;what countries will it be available?;;;;;This is an astonishing spec for a sub £300 device. According to Vodafone website, it's shipping with a VR headset in the box. Really?;;;;;There is hardly any ""bloatware"".;;;;;useful;;;;;This is sold as Vodafone Smart Pro 7 where i live.;;;;;The battery wont be good with 3000 mah at 5.5 inch qhd. The processor will not be amazing- soc 652 wont do well with high res. screen. However, apart from that, this will be a good phone.

Vodafone,Smart ultra 7,";;;;;Seriously awful phone, multiple issues, loaded with standard social apps; facebook, twitter, instagram, snapchat and WhatsApp, all run slow and stop responding, the device states that it is out of space yet there is no file stored locally according to the phone (other than whatapp which I have to clear constantly) If this was the only issue I could persevere however, since day 1 the bluetooth is severely flawed, I use several bluetooth devices, all of which had no issues with previous phones.  After a couple of disconnects and reconnects it no longer wants to accept using the phone function on several devices until you reboot the phone. The phone function (the primary function) crashes quite frequently sometimes leaving you unable to answer calls, see who has called you, see who you've called and sometimes calls people you have not actually dialled instead of the person you intended. I have tried resetting to no avail!   *** AVOID THIS PHONE AT ALL COSTS - NEVER BUYING A VODAFONE PHONE AGAIN EVER!!! ***;;;;;Coming from a z3 compact I knew this would not be as fast but it has to be one of the worst phones out there. Running apps is great... When they start. For example opening messaging cab take 30 seconds.... Really?  18 months in and the battery doesn't last a day, it can go from 20% to 0 in a blink;;;;;No one would care if you ""disapeared"" one night so no one actually cares about your opiniin either;;;;;Had mine about three years. Specs match up to LG at a fraction of the price. Camera not brilliant but otherwise a good bit of gear. Apps ll run well, reasonably fast and plenty of storage for what i use it for. Battery life is better than many of it's higher priced competitors. Value for money it is an excellent everyday tool for me, ;;;;;Worst phone I've ever used avoid this like the plague ,not enough space here to explain it all ,now looking for something better!!!.;;;;;camera is very bad. ;;;;;phone died suddenly. has been working fine but has been a let down. will probably go back to Samsung now;;;;;brilliant phone for price ad it above 12 months not ad a single problem;;;;;brilliant phone for the price ive had it for twelve montys and not a single problem ;;;;;The Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 has been a very useful and reliable phone for me. The screen is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, and there aren't too many cases that are made for it, but those are my only real grievances. For the price you get a very usable phone, and it has lots of good features as well, but that will take me too long to go into. For the price range this is one of the better phones in my opinion. Vodafone hit the sweet spot here.;;;;;Just got this phone and have been back to the Vodafone shop. It continuously restarts in the middle of doing things, worst time when answering the phone. All they did was remove some of the apps. Paid Â160 and fuming with Vodafone. Don't buy this phone;;;;;you can replace by yourself LCD befor you order one from aliexpress or send to warrnaty , you will get the price for repair the glass;;;;;Hi I took my vf700 smart phone in to a shop. Due to the glass broken. I've been told I've got to take it back to Vodafone ?  As no one can do it.  Is that right. ;;;;;Rubbish phone , less than 9gb usable out of 16gb, dunno where the rest of the memory is , plus out of the 9.7ish usable space over 3gb is taken up by system sw .  regularly hangs , is unresponsive, loses my details and I have to set up apps from scratch....installed high quality fast extra storage and the phone can't seem to access it efficiently, all apps on the SD card run really slow and hang. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE !!!!;;;;;Oh dear me...part of Smart Ultra (6) touch screen failed after 10 months, preventing part of the keyboard working. Took it to Vodafone for repair, who examined the externals very closely and found NO damage (I always kept in a case covering back and front of phone) before sending for repair. Vodafone now tell me the fix is chargeable (£70+) despite still being well within warranty. This phone is built to a price, as are it's successors (Smart Ultra 7 and on). I wouldn't choose this phone or it's successors if I was buying again...specs good, great when it's working, but simply not robust enough for my real world use. My experience of Vodafone after sales service is worse than disappointing... A 4* phone, with Vodafone after sales customer service more like an abdication than a service;;;;;This phone was fine for 6 months, now it is a nightmare.  I had to have it repaired by vodafone, leaving me without a phone for a fortnight.  It came back and was great again for about a month, but it has started malfunctioning again.  It overheats, turns itself off and the battery lasts no time.  I have factory reset and this does nothing to stop the continual crashes. Avoid this phone at all costs.;;;;;Exactly the same for me.;;;;;Do us anyone know why my V D F 700 is constantly updating,several times a week? You tube and google update almost daily;;;;;lol;;;;;The phone has a lot of performance issues, very slow if you have added SD card. Absolutely hopeless screen brightness and very poor 4G reception. Very little Android updates and lot of technical snags. ;;;;;For the first month or so, this phone was amazing.....but as time went on, problems began to rear their ugly heads in day to day use. Here are just SOME of the many issues I have discovered:  -The phone doesn't even have Google Now On Tap support, even though the Android version ""claims"" it's running ""6.0 Marshmallow"". -The phone dies at 30-50% battery sometimes. -The phone restarts during the middle of tasks, like phone calls or just flicking through your home screen. -The phone's CPU regularly overheats, up to temperatures like 70-80°C. -The phone's touch screen becomes unresponsive at random intervals of use throughout the day.;;;;;best mobile phone in the market;;;;;best mobile ever;;;;;I got one on a Vodacom SA contract. I can honestly say I love my phone; it's fast, the display is beautiful, responds very well to the touch and visibility is good in sunlight, albeit not great. I also haven't encountered an app I can't run, except the Samsung exclusive Resident Evil 4. It charges quite quickly and has decent battery life for the specs. BUT. I'm very gentle with phones, hence my device still looks as pristine as it did when I got it 2 months ago. However, for some bizarre reason the ringer stopped working. I discovered this when I overslept due to my alarm not waking me up! The phone hasn't been dropped or anything more violent than putting it down on a table. If I tap it in the speaker area while playing music it actually makes sounds, so I think it's a loose connection. I just don't like having a brand new phone I have to use headphones on just to hear the sound on a video clip I got over Whatsapp. The biggest issue here is that Vodacom wants to send it away to be repaired, which leaves me stranded without a phone for about 3 weeks. Which is NOT ideal at all. And if I take it to a local repair shop, my CONTRACT phone's warranty is void. So I'm in the middle of a predicament. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that it's a nice phone for the price, but don't expect Samsung or Blackberry build quality, or classic Nokia reliability. It just isn't there. If you need a reliable phone that can take a punishment, rather go with something you can actually research on the Web before buying it. If you need a portable media player and Android gaming device with a full-HD screen and don't care about the actual purpose of a phone (making and receiving calls...), go ahead and get one. One last minus is that due to its relative obscurity, rooting it is a mission. I wanted to try but after some research I decided against it, as I didn't want to void my warranty AND run the risk to brick my phone at the same time. Here is my verdict for the Vodafone/Vodacom Smart Ultra 7: 
Display: 8/10 
Build Quality: 5/10 
Sound: 6/10 (if it works) 
Performance: 8/10
;;;;;Absolutely hopeless phone ever, cheap & horrible.

All round a nice device, but the poor cameras are very disappointing!!! Also, a bit fragile as for damage in the screen or on the ""metalic"" besel. If that besel was really metalic, a real scratch resistant screen and ""normal"" cameras... a awesome option! But it isn´t so... only a economic option.;;;;; ;;;;;Good luck broke mines screen and nzs biggest tech repair agent cannot find a place to buy the screen for it ... Its like the part does not exist I would not buy another one of these they are a good phone but 400 and if you break it its a write off so go with a name brand you can get repaired ;;;;;Why woukd you drop the phone. its obvious that its going to endure some damage.

Strong enough for everyday use and of course the battery keeps all day with an average use. 6.0 thats why!;;;;;Sorry that's £89.00 and currently out of stock.;;;;;Vodafone still selling the Ultra 6 for £89.99 on their website;;;;;Same problem.flash and shutter out of sync . This phone is terrible . Very slow. Ultra 6 is do much better. ;;;;;Hi. My SD card is not mounting to my phone it says its corrupted. It does give me an option to fix but it fails to do so. Anyone know how to fix. Worked perfectly fine in my phone b4 this model. Thanks;;;;;I have just bought one;;;;;I've had no problems with this so why the hell would you drop it and some of the people on here don't know how to handle a phone or you wouldn't drop it wtf...;;;;;Wtf would you drop it !!!!;;;;;maybe its because you don't know how t handle a phone properly;;;;;What is up with the flash on this thing? The flash goes off and then a split second later the shutter snaps, giving you a great picture of black, or if you're lucky, a lovely dimly lit blur. Totally useless and absolutely pathetic.  ;;;;;Easily the worst camera in low light that I have ever seen on a phone in the last 5 years. The ultra 6 by comparison is in a different league.;;;;;I agree with every word,I am a novice smart phone user, I have had many problems with both the phone and Vodafone. If you go to Coolangatta Assie, they employ sales girls that are dumber than myself,they cannot help you. Roaming charges there are horrific, get a different option.;;;;;I am disappointed with it after a few days using it. The most disturbing is that the zoon is not progressive, it just goes near or far ""by parts"". The speaker on the botton sounds bad and the material is very delicate. I didn´t expect so much about it, but I think it doesn´t worth to buy it, at least in Spain for 200 euros you have similar smartphones with better performance.;;;;;You get what you pay for. A substandard camera and the laggy touchscreen let it down. Multiple touches on the recent or back key are required at times to get it to respond, which just screams Cheap!

I used to have a Bluetooth problem with the 6 but this seems to have been disappeared on the 7. Phone looks and feels better quality than the previous model.;;;;;It's OK, using one to write review. It wouldn't read files off memory card used in Galaxy...odd...had to format card. It gives option for default storage but makes no difference. During FB messenger call if you press home button turns camera off...most continue working. Supplied earphones are better than Samsung, and audio improved a lot since ultra 6. So a mixed bag. If it were £99 be worth it..well in UK. Overpriced, and no FP scanner.;;;;;Looks really similar to Alcatel Pop 4S;;;;;I had assumed on the FP scanner to be honest however it does accept a higher SD card - 256gb over 64gb of the Ultra 6;;;;;Hi, you should try an ultra 6 or better, they're pretty nice for less than 200Â. Had one and no lag with normal usage and gamming ;);;;;;actually no FP scanner and not a bigger sd card capacity;;;;;Really doesn't seem like much of an update over the Ultra 6 from last year.  Smaller battery - just, slightly smaller body, FP scanner, similar chipset with equal GPU (405 has better peak while the T860MP2 has better consistency) and 2gb RAM, it can hold a larger Micro SD card and a newer Android (the Ultra 6 can get Marshmallow but might not get N) that's about all the differences. I was impressed by the Ultra 6, this is just a bit...meh.;;;;;Its the same as the ultra6 in atleast 90% of the features . atleast a bigger battery and better ram wouldve made me wanna buy this. ;;;;;Personally preferred the Smart Ultra 6 with the SD615,I'm sure it performs better aswell besides the heating issues which I never had anyway;;;;;They do lag;;;;;I like vodafone phones they use stock android which is lag free plus mediatek 64bit non heating processors which are efficient","[datetime.date(2018, 3, 12), datetime.date(2018, 3, 11), datetime.date(2018, 3, 5), datetime.date(2018, 2, 25), datetime.date(2018, 2, 16), datetime.date(2018, 1, 17), datetime.date(2018, 1, 11), datetime.date(2018, 1, 9), datetime.date(2018, 1, 6), datetime.date(2017, 12, 5), datetime.date(2017, 11, 13), datetime.date(2017, 10, 28), datetime.date(2017, 9, 21), datetime.date(2017, 9, 6), datetime.date(2017, 7, 7), datetime.date(2017, 7, 5), datetime.date(2017, 6, 27), datetime.date(2017, 6, 23), datetime.date(2017, 6, 22), datetime.date(2017, 6, 14), datetime.date(2017, 6, 11), datetime.date(2017, 6, 10), datetime.date(2017, 6, 10), datetime.date(2017, 6, 7), datetime.date(2017, 6, 5), datetime.date(2017, 5, 19), datetime.date(2017, 5, 16), datetime.date(2017, 4, 4), datetime.date(2017, 4, 2), datetime.date(2017, 4, 1), datetime.date(2017, 3, 31), datetime.date(2017, 3, 23), datetime.date(2017, 3, 23), datetime.date(2017, 3, 18), datetime.date(2017, 3, 17), datetime.date(2017, 3, 16), datetime.date(2017, 3, 13), datetime.date(2017, 3, 12), datetime.date(2017, 3, 6), datetime.date(2017, 2, 28), datetime.date(2017, 2, 28), datetime.date(2017, 2, 24), datetime.date(2017, 2, 23), datetime.date(2017, 2, 18), datetime.date(2017, 2, 12), datetime.date(2017, 2, 9), datetime.date(2017, 2, 9), datetime.date(2017, 2, 8), datetime.date(2016, 12, 25), datetime.date(2016, 12, 19), datetime.date(2016, 12, 5), datetime.date(2016, 12, 2), datetime.date(2016, 12, 1), datetime.date(2016, 12, 1), datetime.date(2016, 11, 30), datetime.date(2016, 11, 26), datetime.date(2016, 11, 23), datetime.date(2016, 11, 21), datetime.date(2016, 11, 12), datetime.date(2016, 11, 8), datetime.date(2016, 10, 28), datetime.date(2016, 10, 27), datetime.date(2016, 10, 27), datetime.date(2016, 10, 25), datetime.date(2016, 10, 24), datetime.date(2016, 10, 23), datetime.date(2016, 10, 15), datetime.date(2016, 10, 14), datetime.date(2016, 10, 7), datetime.date(2016, 10, 6), datetime.date(2016, 9, 21), datetime.date(2016, 9, 21), datetime.date(2016, 9, 8), datetime.date(2016, 8, 30), datetime.date(2016, 8, 10), datetime.date(2016, 8, 4), datetime.date(2016, 7, 25), datetime.date(2016, 7, 20), datetime.date(2016, 7, 20), datetime.date(2016, 7, 19), datetime.date(2016, 7, 18), datetime.date(2016, 7, 7), datetime.date(2016, 7, 2), datetime.date(2016, 6, 27), datetime.date(2016, 6, 23), datetime.date(2016, 6, 23), datetime.date(2016, 6, 23), datetime.date(2016, 6, 23), datetime.date(2016, 6, 23), datetime.date(2016, 6, 23), datetime.date(2016, 6, 23), datetime.date(2016, 6, 23)]"
Vodafone,Smart prime 7,";;;;;The device itself was okay. The camera wasn't to bad, was snappy using the Internet, browsing, YouTube, Facebook. It handles games like Temple run 2 fine. You won't get much from the GPU. But, it took a small fall off the coffee table to ruin the screen. The LCD was fine and the phone was usable. Soon though it froze, I rebooted it and never came on again. I sent it in, repairing it would've cost prety much the same as the phone. So the built quality was poor. Hauwei should be making Vodafone again on the side. Not Alcatel. Specs wise it was great for the price. But the device would need a super tough cover. It doesn't take much to damage it. Rather pay a little more for the hauwei Y5 2017. Or the better built but weaker Nokia 3 if you are on a budget. Super cheap entry level phones aren't worth it. Around the Samsung J3 prime,hauwei Y5 2017,Nokia 3 price range is as low as you can go. ;;;;;I have been using this device for nearly a year and the screen shows 2 burned areas, the camera is very faulty (i believe is the software) giving me black squares and missing colors on multiple pixel (front camera a total joke unless you are in a very good lighting condition). it has a way of overheating by doing simple task like browsing through web (sometimes even when watching locally stored media). Even though its an android the user interface is complicated and unbearable. My device came with 2 apps for calls and 2 for messages, and i needed to disable 2 otherwise i wold get every notification in double. Storage is so low that i am afraid i might run out of data even from updates. Its a pretty bad device and all i loaded to it is: whatsapp, viber and samsung health ;;;;;Rubbish this device runs slow 8gb of storage what a joke! even for basic use it's no good;;;;;Been using this phone for 3 months, got some few tweaks enabled am a baby user, but still functions great, the battery omg...two days is rare but not when using this device;;;;;this phone beats most phones and if u dont believe me, get your bitch ass here and i will show you it is worth the money cause it is;;;;;this phone is dope if you just figure out the hidden stuff on it. it is the reason why vodacom exists. its better than the j1. go search online and you will see. pieces of shit;;;;;What's wrong with it? ;;;;;Don't even. After less than 5 months having bought it, I regret it, hopefully you didn't buy it;;;;;This phone ils rubbish.  Vodafone should remove it from their stores.;;;;;It has only 4 GB internal memory !;;;;;Hi guys.  Does this phone have MirrorLink?;;;;;Seems impossible to create group message. Any ideas?;;;;;hey guys  so i recently lost my samsung phone  and i think i should go for this phone. i like it for the fact that it looks like an i phone 7 .. but looks can be deceiving so should i buy the phone or not ? ;;;;;I've just bought this phone after my Samung S4 decided to cook itself to death. As there was no music player i loaded the app VLC.   It scanned for my music on the SD card which  contained my music files.   No problem in playing music or videos.  Also the app contains a equaliser which improves sound quality when a suitable type is selected.;;;;;Biggest load of rubbbish I have ever held in my hands. I demanded my money back after 2 weeks. It is so slow that it sometimes cant even answer calls! It cant save numbers for whatsapp, it hangs all the time, always runs out of space. It is simply unusable. Dont waste your time and money. If I could give it negative stars I would.;;;;;barely had this phone for a year and its freezing doesn't let me go on any of the apps should of expected this from a cheap phone. I liked it at first but now its just, basically unusable. Thought it was the best £75 I've ever spent but I was wrong it was the worst ;;;;;Bought this phone 2 days ago after finally letting go of my Samsung S4. I would definitely recommend you check this phone out! Vodafone have some really nice handsets for a fraction of the price of bigger name brands like Apple and Samsung. The display is fantastic, unlike my s4 it does not heat up. Apps run smoothly even with Nova launcher, snapchat, drive, whatsapp, pixlr express, face book, twitter and the list goes on. I like the thickness of the device and it has a premium feel in the hand. Camera is fair but good with HDR enabled. The Smart Platinum is also a strong contender but quite a bit more expensive. Very impressed with the phone for the price and it has LTE. ;;;;;When I get an incoming phone call the screen goes black and I have no way of taking the call. Otherwise the phone seems to do everything including messages send and receive ok. Help!;;;;;I bought this phone is just awesome and nice pics and the memory card can be used as internal storage and I like thickness of it is just amazing and the price is reasonable;;;;;I just bought this phpnr, def satisfied with it. Does not feel slow at all, though you may experience latency depending on the apps you use. The screen is also really nice. Excellent value, do recommend.;;;;;Very good phone. Great screen area and very thin. Would def recommend. I haven't had any problems with it at all except the fact that it doesn't have emojis/ emoticons. Otherwise great great phone. Had iPhone 4s previously and switched to smart prime 7- very glad I did its soooo much better. I dont understand why people don't like it? :);;;;;I have learned to keep away from all phones being sold by Telecom providers. They put so much crapware on the phones plus limit its usage with their locking restrictions, that it is very hard to truly enjoy the phone. I low end smartphone offers better usability than these locked, restricted phones.;;;;;very slow phone!! bought it a few days ago and straight away noticed it taken a while to open apps etc like google maps takes about 10 seconds, and havent found a browser yet that works very well on this phone, I owned the prime 6 which was a lot better than this, I just hope they sort it with a update which there is but but this phone wont install it for some reason, if you buy one get the white as black one looks cheap;;;;;Looks decent cheap but slow, freezes constantly,  network error with wifi and there's no issue with my wifi. It may be a budget phone but honestly don't buy it it's not worth the stress mine just sits in the draw only used for a week.;;;;;The worst phone i ve  ever used. IT s really really slow and IT has ping to almost every  action  that You want  to take. When someone calls  it  takes almost 5 seconds  after the ringing for the screen to reveal the name of the caller. Also...when i put it  into the pocket it  takes  photos by itself. Because the keys on the right (volume and power) are built there very badly. Beside that..it  freezes like a lot..very often. And can t do anything about it...can t restart. Can t turn off...the battery is non removable so i  can t get it  out. IT happens to stay  like this as long as it wants...because can t do anything until IT recoveres. And this may take up to 15-20 minutes. For this entire time i may have an emergency and the phone CANNOT BE USED. It  s the worst achievement i Be ever made. Doesn t even Worth those 35-40 usd. Do not buy it...make something better with your money;;;;;nah i dont think so;;;;;I have this phone it takes good picture during the day but the front camera it's not good....... my question is , is it going to receive Android 7.0?;;;;;  2.5D Dragontrail glass;;;;;Hi guys I got the smart prime 7 and it won't let me play my music nor open the files I have downloaded its says it had a music player and it doesn't please help as I carnt find my recept;;;;;ya i have to  ,,,,i also got this this problem in use  mobile;;;;;I bought Vodafone smart prime 7.its a very special fon. But I have found that the handset gets hot,is it the way its suppose to be.it makes me uncomfortable.;;;;;smart prime 7 its very good phone since i save my imformation from huawei p9lite , when i got it just retrieve in a wink off and eye got everything back nice one,,,,i love it...;;;;;What is this phone like for snapchat? Is it good for those kinda selfies where a front flash is needed or is the front screen flash on the Prime 7 useless?;;;;;Bought last week and am amazed with the Performance for £75 good looking ( White)looks Good. Voda have well thought out this Mobile.A Brilliant buy on a Budget Phone. Will sell in white and Gold. To be Honest at its Price you can't Knock it. Will move to the Ultra At Christmas but Great Value For Money. Give it 9 out off 10 for looks and same for performance ( x Mobile Shop Guru)  ;;;;;Vodacom is doing great I lv it more Dan de words can I express;;;;;I just got this phone and its pretty good. No problems what so ever. I just think it needs a better cooling system but apart from that its a great phone;;;;;just keep waiting for 6.0 (good phone good batery and fits well in the pocket)   :);;;;;The clock speed on this processor is actually 1.3 ghz, this means that it's a SD 212 processor and not an SD 210..;;;;;This phone is fine.  It uses marshmallow SD cards properly, so if you put 128GB SD in it you have 128gb system memory.  So don't worry about the 8GB onboard memory.  It has NFC, Strong Bluetooth and wifi radios, full 4G.  It won't play the latest games, but surely you all own tablets for gaming.  This phone is great, the only limitation is the 1gb RAM, but as long as you remember to close background apps this is not a problem. I use the gps while driving and I listen to google play music at the same time.  It receives all Fb, whatsapp and line messages whilst I'm driving and doesn't miss a beat.  Sometimes even a top flight phone will splutter the music with that lot going on.   I'll say it again.  This is one of the very few handsets available that actually utilises all of Marshmallows feature set.  So, Android Pay works, SD card formatted to system memory works, it's good.;;;;;do not buy!!! buy vodafone smart ultra 6. amazing value 4 money!;;;;;This is a crap piece plastic. Snapdragon 210? WHAT? prime 6 had soc 410!!! This phone is a mistake. I am using smart ultra 6. It is awesome. Best specced vodafone. Seriously guys, you would have to be dumb to buy this. ;;;;;Hello guys, atm I have a Alcatel C7 Pop and I do intend to swap it, but I am a cheap bastard, so I was woundering if this was a upgrade since im only paying 80 euros for it and I dont really understand a shit about celphones;;;;;who manufacturers this phone? what comes in the box? how is the build quality?;;;;;this smart prime 7 is a downgrade from prime 6. for exmaple CPU is more slower then last year model;;;;;Great value for money, I was using the VF Smart Prime 6 device before and I'm really happy with my new VF Smart Prime 7. ;;;;;Lol Vodafone isn't able to build good looking smartphones with good value. They should rather invest their money into 5G and the web of kabeldeutschland;;;;;SOC and Video Res specs are incorrect. It actually uses the 1.3Ghz SD212 (identical to the SD210 but 200mhz faster). Video recording is limited to 720p, not 1080p as the SD212 can not handle higher than 720p.;;;;;You would pretty silly to upgrade your prime 6 for this. Comedians.....;;;;;25 Â euro phone;;;;;Yep, Vodafone have made a mistake. The obvious downgrade in chipset (SD410 down to SD210) is the biggest hit but they have also made it bigger but kept the screen the same. So it's now slower and less ergonomical. But it's ok because they've given us, wait for it...40mah of extra battery! I don't think that's an argument it can win. 'Yes, we have given you a slower chipset, so much so that anything above Temple Run 2 will lag, but we've given you more battery. Unfortunately due to the outdated technology of the A7 cores there's no real efficiency bonuses so the 40mah extra will - perhaps - add another 5 minutes. On standby.' I do hope they get it right and upgrade the Ultra. I liked that phone and got very close to buying one.;;;;;What an opportunity to improve on the 6, but Vodafone are giving us a lesser chip? Vodafone, tell us this is a mistake and they come with the Ultra's MSM8939. Or at least the 410 same as the 6. Not less???!!!;;;;;Lmfao , the smart prime 6 had a sd 410 while this has 210 , is this a joke ?;;;;;Really Vodaphone?

For  $89 you get a phone with a severely underpowered processor and glitchy display that randomly restarts itself whenever it feels like it. Battery life is decent but that's about the only upside to the device. Went back to using my Samsung J1, as Samsung knows how to make a reliable device at least ;;;;;My wife and I bought a phone each about 5 months ago. Both phones have increasingly performed badly vis a vis battery losing its charge overnight while on idle. The phone has been sent back to Vodafone on several occasions and no improvements have been made.

For US$40 (NZ$60) as purchased at HarveyNorman NZ, including NZ$29 Vodafone SIM it is a great, cheap phone. You get 1GB/8GB, quad core SoC, Android 5.1, LTE (4G), GPS, 4.5"" screen, removable battery, micro-SD slot(up to 64GB works for me). The camera is less than stellare, but adequate for snaps and WhatsApp. I keep it in the car: great for Navigation, GPS is good, even has a compass. Usable in emergency even without SIM. 4.5"" is a good size; any smaller is hard to read, any larger its hard to carry. (I have owned all sizes). Good first phone, spare phone, and for Android beginners.

And of course,there's no available root technic...;;;;;Can anyone help me my LTE service isn't activated please help;;;;;have had to reset twice in first 24 hour of owning, its not looking good! and not charging very well either ;;;;;this phone needs a serious update, message vibrate doesnt work and google search bar keeps disapearing and option to change wallpaper when u hold on home screen is not there any more apart from that its ok for £40;;;;;vodafone is taking care of this phone just received an update many manufacturers couldnt even be bothered with that;;;;;Don`t opt for Android at Vodafone. Wait for IOS in Vodafone. LOLZ....;;;;;After coming from flagship phones its no shock my review wont be the fairest. Its solid made but still feels less than budget in the hand, although it almost stock android its jam packed full of vodaphone bloatware that is not needed and hinders the all ready over driven CPU and the small amount of ram,  After a good clean out of all the vodaphone apps i found it to be a little faster and the UI is smooth untill you start running background multitasks,  WHY vodaphone have made the text app all about them is horrific and its better to root your texts via the google hangouts app to avoid the pointless ram eating and very anoying pop ups. The camera is shocking to say the least but will take a picture good enough to be viewed on the handset or of a meal to make your mum cry that your mates mum cooks better grub. The screen is enough for doing normal tasks but you can see the lower spec when trying to read text and view pictures, internet browsing is not very good and you feel how slow CPU is working when loading pages and if you receive any calls or messages the phone clearly cant cope and becomes slow and glitchy In reflaction they could of done a little more at this price but for a very low end phone it does the job, calls are clear and signal is great! simple games work fine and its good to check social media, its very good as a first phone,a back up,going out in the mud or for kids as its built like a tank and can take a few knocks and at the price and be easy to replace if lost or broken,
 
if this is your only option at this price then grab a bargin but if you want a grown ups phone or something for the advanced android lover then hold on to your cash and save up for something far better

Regards;;;;;I've had this phone for 17 months and overall it's a great phone for the price, but the screen looks to be failing slightly - the letter Y hardly works any more and battery doesn't last as long as it used to (used to get 1 1/2 of moderate use now I only get 7 or 8 hours).;;;;;It is a very good phone,It has almost 3 years and it runs like new:It is easy to find a lot of cutom roms or custom recovery for this phone,all these are easy to install compared to other phones.Now I have Android 7.1.2 boosted by grenify and installed by TWRP and has dolby support.;;;;;First phone a dud.

Love it, no complaints. I will seriously consider another Vodafone when I upgrade in a year or so.;;;;;On my SU6's second birthday, a big crack appeared on the screen, and I decided to call it a day. A fantastic phone for the time I had it....well deserving of full burial rights in the back garden XD ;;;;;Near made it to the 2 year mark but sadly the touch screen has stopped working around the corners. Pretty good but really I wanted it to last a bit longer...;;;;;Almost two years have passed and it still working fine. No problems with the tap screen, nothing. Very satisfied wity vodafone.;;;;;Lmao, same ;;;;;best budget smart phone ever - had it for 2 years and it never went wrong - safe FAM!!;;;;;Got that phone two years ago. It was good value for its money, having a 1080p screen, but as it turns out its not particularly reliable.  I have started having issues with the touch screen - parts of it sometimes become unresponsive, usually the left-most quarter of the screen. The interface glitches sometimes, closing all apps constantly to the extend that it makes the phone unusable. Even though its a cheap phone, I expected more longevity from it.;;;;;Same problems as the others with the touch screen. It's so annoying. Don't buy this phone.;;;;;started off as a great phone with a great camera, but after less than a year parts of the screen wouldn't work so some letters didn't work on my keyboard, and then two out of three of the main buttons on the bottom of the screen broke, so it quickly became very frustrating to use.;;;;;Oh dear me...part of touch screen failed after 10 months, preventing part of the keyboard working. Took it to Vodafone for repair, who examined the externals very closely and found NO damage (I always kept in a case covering back and front of phone) before sending for repair. Vodafone now tell me the fix is chargeable (£70+) despite still being well within warranty. This phone is built to a price, as are it's successors (Smart Ultra 7 and on). I wouldn't choose this phone or it's successors if I was buying again...specs good, great when it's working, but simply not robust enough for my real world use. My experience of Vodafone after sales service is worse than disappointing... A 4* phone, with Vodafone after sales customer service more like an abdication than a service;;;;;Hi Did you manage to resolve your issue with network error as i seem to be receiving the same message;;;;;Hi all, I recently purchased a smart ultra 6 and i am pretty happy with it. I am experiencing a problem when attempting to update the Software (OS) to marshmallow; after downloading it via the software update window on the phone, the phone refuses to install and states a mismatch. Did anyone encounter such a problem and how did you fix it? My baseband is : P839V55B01 Kernel version: 3.10.49 Build number: VDF-995NB01-IT09b (I suppose the IT means Italy)

Currently with 5.1.1 it's 11.16GB. Thanks, Mark;;;;;Steve corrected that statement. It is of course the newer Smart Ultra 7 that is made by Alcatel (and is not as good).;;;;;That's a Marshmallow feature, storage is handled differently, not a fan.;;;;;Same problem, 'standard home screen stopped' repeatedly after upgrade. Did you find a fix?;;;;;device supports any network simcard but its only one sim;;;;;Does it let any SIM card to work or only vodafone SIM ? Can i replace sd card with second SIM ?;;;;;What do You think is better,hwawei p8 li&#539;e or Vodafone Smart ultra 6?;;;;;That is probably because your phone's internal memory got full. There are some applications that use phone's internal memory as their default storage. Email services, and Whatsapp are the common ones, you may need to clear up the contents to free some more space. Please note internal memory is not the RAM (currently goes up to max 4GB in high-end phones), it is the storage (usually comes with over 16GB space in new phones).;;;;;There is a Android 6.0 update. I received a notification today and updated my ultra 6 to marshmallow.;;;;;I have the sane issue since the update last week. Surely I'm missing something - my phone is now constantly telling me I've no space yet my SD card is virtually empty. So angry as I got rid of my previous phone for this very reason and have had no bother at all with the smart ultra 6 til the last update!!;;;;;I tried to update my Fone wen it finished uploading & I went to install d package a lot of writing came up and said reboot etc I cudnt get d new update &#128542; why is dis;;;;;Yes, no option to format the SD as internal storage, despite what the Vodafone website tells you. Vodafone help was also pretty useless - the box there got me to do a factory reset. Didn't work, but the upside to Marshmallow is that my battery life has improved enormously. ;;;;;That must be why it has 'Made in China by ZTE' stamped on the back. :-) ;;;;;Yup, same here;;;;;Updated it yesterday to 6.0.1 ...since then i can´t install any apps on my sd card...did it happened to you aswell? regards Diogo;;;;;I have this phone since August 2015, And it's Awesome! I bought it with point promotion from vodafone. costed only 90Â at the time. Damn Octa core, 2gb, ram, 13mpx camera, 16gb rom. Super for that price there would be nothing better. The only cons I have is that the camera is a bit slow to shoot. Besides that everything top. It falled maaaaany times... Really.. and it's completely functional, just some scratches. Screen is perfect too. Very nice build. I would buy a next model that was just good as this. (not the su7, its not that good) And now with marshmallow I think I'll have this phone for more a couple of years.;;;;;Excellent phone, have used this for 15 months, still working well. Upgraded to Android 6.0.1 last night without issues, compares very favourably with my experience of Samsung phones. Incidentally my phone is unlocked and I'm on 3, so very happy I still get android updates (including security updates).;;;;;upgraded yesterday, anyone else having major battery issues loosing 1% every 5mins approx.;;;;;The upgrade process for Marshmallow is a little cumbersome but all then same the new update is a nice reminder I'll probably not need a new phone for at least 3 years. The phone is top notch.;;;;;Not impressed with new SD card options with Marshmallow, had to do lots of fiddling about to move apps to card and still having problems, bit of a backwards move from Android this.;;;;;got the new 6.0.1 update today for smart ultra 6 and its not working right  it keeps coming with  standard home screen has stoped whent in to the store and found out i was not the only one they had 5 more with the same thing. and no help file on web site and not much help form on lone asistance;;;;;Android 6.0.1 is now live ;;;;;For those who are interested, I have just upgraded my vodafone smart ultra 6 from lolipop to marshmellow.;;;;;It is a good phone.After two years works perfect.No lag,no problem.;;;;;hi all;I got this smartphone since December 2015,,,,,,,so far I didn't have any problem with;it works absolutly great,,,I reccomand.;;;;;and yet it fits an iphone case ...;;;;;I must apologize. I gave a few bad reviews regarding the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. I was originally very disappointed with this phone. After about 3 month of frustration I decided to go directly to the customer care and explained my problem with phone. They checked or tested the phone and after a few days, they swoped it and gave me a new one. Since then, it's about two months now, I have'nt had any problems.;;;;;I have had the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 for nearly 1.5 years, and it has been a fantastic phone. Perhaps I have just gotten lucky, but all of the negative reviews I read about it are completely different from my experience. Some of the reviews don't seen to take into account the price. This phone (when new) cost about 25% of comparable big-name handsets. Of course so many people foolishly forget about price because they spread the cost out over a 2 year contract, which is frankly just poor financial practice. I have dropped this phone more times than I care to admit, but luckily it has not been affected apart from some scratches on the corners. I use my phone *constantly* - I listen to music and podcasts all day, make many calls and texts, do web searches and watch videos, and in the evening I play games on it. The battery has obviously weakened over time, but it still lasts through my work day until I get home, which I find very impressive given its age, and the very heavy use it gets every day.  Of course there are some minor issues, mainly that the OS has become slow with age, however I think this is because it needs to be wiped and freshly installed (when I get around to it). But I have less trouble then my family and friends, who all have Samsung, Sony, and Motorola phones (costing much more than this phone did!) All around, I consider this phone to be one of the best purchases I have ever made, of any kind!;;;;;I have one of these which I use in France, Asia and Australia. The biggest problem I have had is that i don't think the antenna is very good.  Away from cities in Australia, using identical Sims, my wife's iPhone 4 often picked up a good signal whereas I picked up none at all. Otherwise I am pretty happy with this phone.;;;;;Nicely put agree with you great phone for the price I bought mine for £90 brand new had no problems with it does everything I need value for money compared with how much you pay for a iPhone or galaxy.;;;;;I thought it was made by zte but OK anyway will it get the 6.0.1 update;;;;;I have a Vodafone Ultra 6 using Android 5.1.1. Does anyone know if I can update to 6.0? The phone is unlocked and NOT with Vodafone. I've tried the phone's 'online update' feature but it keeps coming back with 'network error' message. Thanks for your comments.;;;;;It looks nothing like an iPhone ;;;;;Pressing pause in the call it will doping what tou want...;;;;;I loved this phone, sadly I dropped it a few months after buying. I still used it for a year with the whole screen cracked that's how great the phone was wish I could have it back.;;;;;Yes the battery is great, lasts ages, the weak points are think are the camera and no Gorilla Glass, good phone though.;;;;;I bought this phone in February 2016, and being a teenager, I used it a lot. It was my main source of contact. I use it for Snapchat, Instagram, Kik, Twitter, everything. I fell in love with it at first sight because of its massive screen (size of an iPhone 6s+ and not far off the iPhone 7!) I remember asking for the price and it was £120! It was like heaven on earth! Sadly, within the first week I was having problems! Of course, being a teenager, I text - A LOT. I had an unlimited texts, 150 minutes worth of calls and 500mb of data, I managed to use the unlimited texts up (um, excuse me? UNLIMITED??) I paid for unlimited and got 1000? I've been to Vodafone several times in many places and never once have they sorted it out: ""bar in your number"" ""We'll sort it, wait 24 hours"". What a load of rubbish. Never worked. So apart from terrible service and bundles, I had problems with the speed of the device.. ""Snapdragon"".. More like SNAPTURTLE. If you want quick access to an app or want to answer a text quickly - THIS IS NOT THE PHONE FOR YOU. It takes me several attempts of restarting my phone and going in and out of apps before I can actually physically reply to somebody. Not to mention: app crashings; phone taking control of itself. I bought the phone in February and already wanted a new one in August. I hate it so much! Don't get me wrong, the size and price is exquisite, so is the camera - I love the camera! Amazing flash, so many lovely comments on my photos on how my quality is good! But if I go into Snapchat for example: it crashes! If I go into instagram: It backs in and out of things like someone else is controlling my phone! I can't deal with it! The death of my phone happened on 11/15/16.. NOT LONG AFTER I BOUGHT IT?! I was going to type my password in and it wouldn't let me press any keys! So great - locked out of my phone! Before people try and tell me to reset it or take it to Vodafone - I have reset it.. It worked well for about an hour..... and I can't take it to Vodafone - it doesn't even switch on anymore, I don't have enough money to get it properly repaired, plus, I don't even want it to be repaired.. Terrible piece of work. Never going with Vodafone again with any of their phones, will be going unlocked. Pile of trash. Do not recommend at all. ;;;;;I've had this phone for over a year now, and I love it for it's big screen and great look. It looks just like an iPhone and many people have asked me is this an iPhone! Decent camera, but after a while it gets super slow and laggy if the memory is too full, and it doesn't have much memory. A good phone, but won't last more than 2 years;;;;;Phurya , its very true. am using vodafone smart ultra 6 since April and am enjoying it well especially its camera . yes for me its the best phone ever ;;;;;is the camera good?;;;;;Some comments here make no sense,  really... Smart 6 is probably the best Vodafone branded smartphone ever. It is made by ZTE, it has Qualcomm inside,  not one of those chinese processors... And for the money you simply could not have better. The new Smart 7 it's not has good, not even close.there are some great custom roms out there that will improve the user experience in every way. Just don't get fooled by bad users. ;;;;;how can i get one to buy in Africa  -ghana;;;;;How do I get call waiting on this phone;;;;;I got my Vodafone Smart ultra 6 for the past 6 months and I'm using it in Africa, it's a good mobile with a good sensibility.;;;;;ZTE brand no longer supports VSU6 phones, today I tried to look on their web-site to see if there's anything moves, apparently few countries have disappeared from their grid support, including the UK, Romania ...

Haven't installed messenger yet.;;;;;reinstall facebook and messenger - known issue which has been rectified;;;;;My old fone which is a Sony Xperia which I sometimes use, the reception I get is either 3G or H+ (HSDPA)and I also use a Vodacom Power tab 10 on which I get the same reception but on my Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 most of the time only E (Edge). What can the reason be, it's in the same area. It's very frustrating.;;;;;it only started doing that since the facebook and messenger update last week (the apps worked fine before that!!);;;;;I have had my Vodafone ultra6 for 1 month then Facebook/Messenger freezers. So unhappy. I would not recommend this to anyone.;;;;;Realy?;;;;;A pirce of plastic made in china . twice in service in one month.. Don&#539; do what i did.;;;;;I found a solution which appears to be working for me. See the main thread for details.;;;;;I found a solution which appears to be working for me. See the main thread for details.;;;;;I have a solution which seems to work for me. See main thread.;;;;;I have a solution which worked for me. See main thread.;;;;;I have a solution which works for me. See main thread.;;;;;Regarding the problems caused by the updates to Facebook and Facebook Messenger on 03.08.2016, I appear to have found a solution. At least it is working so far. After uninstalling the apps and rebooting the phone I ensured that everything else was working properly again. Then I went to uptodown via a browser, downloaded the uptodown app. I had to accept the warning about apps from untrusted sources and change the setting to allow. Then I downloaded the one before the last under previous versions of Facebook and Facebook Messenger. Once they were installed, everything seems to be working as before 03 August 2016 updates. I accept no responsibility for damage to your phone or its software. Good luck if you decide to follow my actions.;;;;;Me too. I checked on the Play Store and it looks like Facebook ended compatibility with the Smart Ultra 6. I did manage to install the new version before they flagged it as incompatible, but it just kept freezing the phone and killing the input. Hopefully they'll continue support in the future :/;;;;;it happed to mine also...;;;;;this morning i woke up to my phone that had frozen in the middle of the night. it obviously froze at 6:27 as that what the screen is stuck on and is now 5pm and is still frozen;;;;;My phone can no longer log onto facebook and so uninstalled it but facebook isn't even on play store on my phone - What the Heck do i do now!!!! Feeling very confused;;;;;I love the fone but now it just freezes and it can't work I don't know what to do;;;;;Phone is very good in my opinion. Only thing is that the battery is not removable even though this says otherwise. The home screens have a few bugs where the apps go invisible but its easily resolved, gets tedious thoughh;;;;;you may be putting it in the wrong slot, i was trying to put it in the memory thing too;;;;;Never buy that. It is great phone. However no warranty. After 6 month the screen started to play around. It was sent to vodafone  to repair under the warranty however they wanted to charge. Screen has no single scratch the phone like new but no chance to use after 6 month.;;;;;download the manual form the internet, use the pin tool or a paperclip and press the tool into small dot recess on the sim cover ...on the top right edge of the phone. push gently and it pops open. the sim should only fit into the cradle one way so you can't put it in the wrong way. then gently push it in.;;;;;How to insert a simcard into my ultra 6. I am really struggling;;;;;Did any one know when this phone get marshmallo ;;;;;nice;;;;;Did any one know when this phone get marshmallo ;;;;;Multiple faults on mine. Randomly switches between message apps. Phone screen turns upside down. Goes to silent mode by itself.;;;;;how can i change theme in my ultra smart phone 6?? plssssss steps ;;;;;Pls, how can i change theme on my ultra smart fone? details plsssssssssss;;;;;Yes!!;;;;;did anyone know got pure Android or not ;;;;;Is it getting marshmallow update or how to root it ? Kingroot won't work;;;;;There is an error in specificatios,battery is not removable.Otherwise,it is great phone.For its price,is a flagship phone.ZTE is a company that will reach the top three!;;;;;It's not saying the price it's available for is bad (or good) just that it's in the lower end of phone prices overall. It's not a judgement just an indication of what price range it is sold in, so you can compare similar ones in that range.;;;;;If you click on 4/10 it shows the price is around 170 euros. From what I've seen from another phone, that is 1/10, it says it costs 50 euros. So I think that it means that the closer to 0, the cheaper it is, and closer to 10, it's more expensive. That's it :);;;;;Its not a rating exactly, its the price group. So 1/10 is cheap but 10/10 is expensive.;;;;;I don't really get what 4/10 in price means, it should mean it has a bad price right? Bad price on the negative or positive? That is, too cheap for what it is or too expensive? According to what i see this seems to be a great phone, however, on the vodafone's phones pamphlet it said 1.5Ghz octa-core, i suppose a quite different version they sell atm. (there's also the possibility it's a pamphlet typo);;;;;does it possible to find its display on Nepal...my screen crack...;;;;;between vodafone smart u6 and the infocus m810 which is preferable;;;;;This is a great phone for its price. I got this when it was exactly 2 months old end of last July. It will not get marshmallow for anyone wondering. Which is a shame. This is due to the fact that the Vodafone smart ultra 7 will be released in the month of June this year and will run marshmallow. Not known about the other specs but can expect another 5.5 inch device with marshmallow and a similar price tag to the last version. This update to this phone follows updates to the other Vodafone range. The smart first and smart prime which got an updated phone in may this year a year after the last phone version. So if anyone is thinking of buying the Vodafone smart ultra 6 hold out either for the new version in a month or a price reduction on it once the new phone is available. ;;;;;Thanks a lot..Obviously they aren't as informed as they shoud be. ---Is it possible to root it without any ""danger"", and make it just a Zte device, without any Vodafone logos, apps, e.t.c. ???;;;;;should I get this or Xiaomi Redimi Note 3? I live in New Zealand and this phone is $100 cheaper ($250 NZD compared to Xiaomi $350 on Ebay) right now as it is on sale. I'm quite attracted to Xiaomi's fingerprint scanner though. Thoughts?;;;;;Compare with iphone 6;;;;;I got my Redmi 3 for £106. The SU6 is good but there are better phones available now. It's not as good value as it was when first released.;;;;;They're wrong. It's ZTE. The stock roms even come from zte's website. ­ ;;;;;Looking at Vodafone Romania the phone is actually manufactured by ZTE. At least that's what their site say. The actual phone is listed as Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 VE so it might not be the same phone but I doubt it.;;;;;Indeed it is..I finally found out. Thanks a lot.;;;;;Thanks everyone for your replies..I finally found one emploee in a Vodafone store, that reasurred me, its an Alcatel device.;;;;;Thanks everyone for your replies..One emploee in a Vodafone store, whom i finally found to ""certainly"" know, assured me that its an Alcatel device.;;;;;Yep, it's one of the main selling, points! It's got it written on the back as well :-);;;;;Please can someone tell me if the phone is compatible to the 4G network ?;;;;;It Alcatel;;;;;Yes, ZTE Blade Ultra.Very glod phone...;;;;;sure you work in a store and don´t want people to buy a bargain sure I ll take your word ALDRABãO;;;;;awesome mobile only 199 euro, very good photos, very good video filling fast battery, light display good, compass, pam good, excellent mobile. good battery life. very nice ;;;;;yea zte;;;;;Excuse me.Does anybody know which company is the manifacturer of this device..?? Is it ZTE ??;;;;;This phone is superb! ;;;;;I've had this phone since October 2015. Probably the best purchase I've ever made. Got it for £125 and you'd usually expect a phone to perform underwhelming at that price. This phone is a completely different story. The screen, CPU power, ram and camera are on par with phones that'd cost another £50 at the least. The only thing that's even remotely bad is the plastic body. But can you really complain when the performance feels so premium? If you're looking for a cheap phone but don't want any performance issues, this is the phone for you. 10/10;;;;;Had the phone since July 2015, unlocked it for £3(ebay) and added a 128Gb SD card. On a 600 minute 1Gb data contract with Virgin UK. It's in my estimation the best phone you can get at that price (£120) by a mile! I've seen no others that remotely compete with it's value for money and super spec.;;;;;Is a very good phone related to its price!;;;;;Wonderfull machine ! For 199eur !!;;;;;Locked means it will only work with a Vodafone network sim card, unlocking it will allow you to use any mobile network sim card in any country;;;;;Get a decent car.;;;;;Seriously guys my brother just got one of these AND HE LOVES IT I'm getting one too and It's so I give it a 5/5 If your planning on buying this phone buy it I wouldn't listen to people who say not to. ;;;;;you could just download an app which makes the brightness dimmer;;;;;I work in a mobile store in portugal and I've tried this mobile phone and believe me it is horrible. The specs look awesome but the phone works bad. it's slow , no camera quality. dont buy this ;;;;;You're right. I have two units, and adaptive brightness definitely seems inconsistent. Tap to wake is a joke, and I've found internet threads discussing this.  My advice to prospective buyers is; don't let your purchasing decision be influenced by this feature, because it's totally unreliable. ;;;;;Can get my Ultra Smart 6 to connect with my Honda CRV hands free blue tooth;;;;;XIAOMI REDMI NOTE 2 16GB might now better than this in SA. +/- R300 cheaper and a little   better spec wise. Selling @ incredible connection. However no contract option on Xiaomi. ;;;;;I think it won't get the Marshmallow Update. If it would it would show like ""planned update to Marshmallow"" where it specifies which Android version it comes with ( in this case 5.0 Lollipop ). Hope I helped;;;;;Any one tell me about expected update for android marshmallow on vodafone  smart ultra 6?;;;;;With the right tools & a little care the device can be easily opened & battery is replaceable.    ;;;;;Reformat the 128G SD card in the SU6 device for it to operate properly.../;;;;;Not with me! Adaptive brightness is fine with me and double tap to wake works 99% of the time. You must have a faulty unit. ;;;;;Lol no it's not Vodafone is UK company.zte has more quality in all aspect;;;;;This phone have big problem with adaptive brightness level and duble tap to unlock;;;;;Its on the Vodafone network. This phone is available in many countries not just the UK. It can be unlocked cheaply. Codes are on eBay for a couple of euro. I bought mine in Ireland and am now on three Ireland's network with this phone as I got it unlocked. Hope this helps you.;;;;;Hello, yesterday I got this phone as I thought it is a nice upgrade from my vodafone smart 4 max. (which was great value for money). I have some screeen responsivness issues, tell me if you experience the same problems. For example when i scroll down at facebook app, most times it opens the first topic i have my finger on instead of scrolling down. Also bottom row of letters at keyboard (holding phone at vertical position) is a bit difficult to touch them correctly.;;;;;What does ""locked"" mean? What if I'm neither a Vodafone user nor from the UK?;;;;;No;;;;;I was also victimised by Vodacom sa. They together with MTN want to milk the public like trying to force customers to pay for WhatsApp etc. Go for Cell C or better advice, emigrate, the country is now falling apart fast. ;;;;;Hi Guys. I am in South Africa and have purchase this phone. The glass of my device broke and Vodacom SA who are the sole distrubutors of Vodafone devices told me that it cannot be repaired.  Please ensure with the supplier that your device will have support should it break down.;;;;;Is it dual sim ???;;;;;You have to press the volume down button with the power button at the same time and hold it for about 1-2 seconds.;;;;;It's a ZTE product! Had buy and at the end of 25 days, don't recognize the SD CARD, went to VODAFONE ASSISTANCE, board changed. After 7 days, it's dead!!!!!! Turn on only, with the charge cable and loop mode ""powered by Android"" intro message VODAFONE PORTUGAL, doesn't change the smartphone broken, not funcional for a new one, send again to assistance.  It's a 32days cellphone, be aware!!!! Before buy this cellphone, had ponderate the elephone and others, but for the assistance response went to this VODAFONE product, sad and badlly, internal rules doesn't want a satesfy costumes!!!!;;;;;You won't get updates now its rooted;;;;;Faulty phone mine runs all games;;;;;The cheap SD cards don't work properly,I've had them;;;;;Put a different sim in unlock it using that network sim them put yours back in;;;;;True ,,mine was about £2.45 off eBay,had code in 3 hrs. Brilliant device really and use mine for work so if I break it its just 115GBP to get new one.;;;;;Also, battery is not removable, unless you're willing to take your phone apart.;;;;;Just eBay unlock codes for it. All you have to do is send them your IMEI code and they'll usually send you a code in about an hour. No rooting required.;;;;;This phone is locked to Vodafone by default. You need to pay to get it unlocked.;;;;;Ace cheap phone - perhaps the best phone for the budget. No need to worry about unlocking,bought an unlock code from eBay for a couple of quid. Just put my SIM card in, typing in the code, and I was good to go!;;;;;I saw one in a Vodafone shop in Groningen last Summer. I think that it was also cheaper than in Britain. Very good value for money (also has a fantastic torch).;;;;;I'm in Sweden and I'm trying to get a COMVIQ simcard to work. When I turn the phone on with the sim inside, there is no prompt for an unlock code, though I've never unlocked it. Even if I had an unlock code, I wouldn't know how/where to enter it in. Instead, there is simply a notification (the triangle shield with an exclamation point) which says that my selected network (Tele2) is unavailable. Anyone have any ideas?;;;;;It only accepts up 64gb micro sd memory cards;;;;;I have this phone, and believe me, it is not as crap as its price suggests. The camera is decent, performance is snappy, screen is bright enough for most weather (then again, I'm Scottish, we don't have much sun), and while made of plastic it feels very nice in the hand. The only caveats are that it is vodafone locked and has some bloatware, but i got an unlock for £3 from E-Bay and all of the bloat can be uninstalled or disabled. It can be updated to Android 5.1.1 too, which is a nice addition. Overall, a very good phone, not to be overlooked for it's seemingly con-like price. Hope this helps.;;;;;Is this phone also availabe in The Netherlands? I'm a Vodafone user, so probably it won't be a problem to use it in The Netherlands?;;;;;It sounds like a phoney card which is probably 2Gb but masked to look like 128Gb.  If it cost a few £ only then there is your answer.;;;;;on the specs on gsmarena it has: MEMORY	Card slot	microSD, up to 64 GB;;;;;The phone is amazing.it does what intends to do.it is a cheaper version of an iphone 6 plus.trust me, it is a best buy!i installed nova launcher, disabled all the transitions, animations and it runs very smooth.never encountered a stubble or hickup and i have it for about 3 weeks.also installed clean master and battery doctor and the battery seems to last ages.also the battery saving mode which is a native function build in the android is very good at preserving battery life and it ALSO IMPROVES PERFORMANCE A LOT WHEN ACTIVATED.;;;;;Hi, I recently bought a 128GB SD card off eBay and put it in my new Vodafone Smart Ultra 6, as I read it can take that much.. but I have been having problems with it.. I have 113GB available, yet, when making a new folder it days I have no room on my SD card??  can anyone help me;;;;;Screenshotting does work, I do it all the time, it's just that you need to HOLD both power and down volume button together at the same time.;;;;;You have to hold down the power button and volume down button at the same time for about a second and I don't know about the camera.;;;;;is there an Android Marshmallow rom for the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6? I love this phone but really want it to run the latest version of android ;;;;;Does anyone know how to...... 1 - take a screenshot? (Tried pushing the volume down and power button but doesn't work ) 2 - take a quick pic ,like on iPhone you just press volume button, is there similar feature?;;;;;hi  phone is great,  but can some one tell me how I can reduce the resolution of the images. as I require to send a lot of images each day via email.;;;;;hi  phone is great,  but can some one tell me how I can reduce the resolution of the images. as I require to send a lot of images each day via email.;;;;;I had the same problem as yourself. I had to bring in back and get my money back;;;;;2 GB RAM  and octacore processor and it cant run snapchat properly cant even download fifa 16 :/;;;;;Super phone!For this price,is the best on market!Desigin is very nice,best display,good sound and hardware run perfectly!A few litle diference to Galaxy s6!;;;;;Hold the bottom right button on the keyboard, and a emoji symbol will show up. Move your finger over it and then let go and you will be able to use emojis &#128512;;;;;;You have to unlock it first, as its locked to Vodafone when bought.;;;;;Vodafone Ireland replied to me saying it will monitor the interest in the android 6.0 update. So if the interest is there from the public and the interest is shown it should receive the update in the future. My smart ultra 6 was only updated to 5.1 3 weeks ago so 6.0 could be months away. Vodafone UK had a similar statement if interest is there it shiuld be updated also from my reading online. Bare in mind its zte who update it not Vodafone;;;;;Yes.;;;;;The speaker is really poor on this phone (I have two unit's, so I know it's not just a defective speaker). My 1st Gen Moto G had a pretty bad speaker, but this one is significantly worse. You have to have it at max volume for speakerphone, and all it's really fit for is ringtones/alarms.;;;;;Unbelievably good value at £113.40 on Amazon UK (January 2016). Pros: + Screen is decent! + SD Card slot + UNBEATABLE value  + 7 times cheaper than an iPhone 6S! (Yes, iPhone has best camera, processor etc - but this is still comparable in features) Cons: - Only Android 5.1.1 for now (Made by ZTE, so hopefully 6.x coming soon) - Needs a tempered glass screen protector (not GorillaGlass) 
- I haven't figured out how to get permanent root yet (use KingRoot apk for now);;;;;They are pretty loud;;;;;Best value for money smartphone of 2015 without a doubt...currently on 5.1.1 lollipop but a marshmallow update is likely;;;;;It's made by ZTE!;;;;;Im in the uae and bought this phone, I put a sim card and its asking for a network pin. What do I do?;;;;;There aren't any official posts about the update but i've read that it's on testing. ;;;;;What about the audio quality of the speaker? Is it loud enough?;;;;;Truly Brilliant! Bought this phone the other day instead of an iPhone and by god I am happy I did. It is spectaculer and I would reccomend it to anyone. Just one thing! Can't figure out how to use emojis!;;;;;its totaly copied from yureka mobile ......and its feature so simmilar with yureka . i though why yureka didnot take vital step of this criminal activity....;;;;;Hi, How are you (and any other users on this forum) finding the call and sound quality? Does the size of the phone become uncomfortable if you hold it for a while?;;;;;This phone is outstanding I've been putting it against the z3 compact comparing camera, browsing speed and I'm totally blown away with how it performs it is truly the best phone for the price BUY NOW!! Ps otg does work! You just need to get a different file manager like es file explorer.;;;;;Lovely phone, shame that its in lollipop and not on marshmallow, is there a planned update;;;;;i cant open clash of clans;;;;;Please this smartphone can take USB otg adapter? Can I use USB key (storage) or put keyboard with this device?;;;;;I have been using this phone for six months now. It is a big phone and most of the time you will need both hands, however being a big phone I do most of my stuff on this phone now. It has plenty of power to do everything I need it to. On average I get two days from the battery. For what I paid and what it delivers I am absolutely happy with it and would recommend. ;;;;;Best of the best !;;;;;Less than 3 quid on eBay. Had my code in 15 minutes;;;;;no, only German, English, Spanish, french and Italian, at least when bought in Ireland;;;;;Looks a cracking Fone gettin it Monday..canny wait pml;;;;;who ever owns this phone can you please tell me if there is Chinese language on it please. thank you :) ;;;;;What about the camera on this one? I tried it and it did not compare well with the Galaxy J5. Looked OK but didn't grab as much detail as the Samsung. Maybe just that phone?;;;;;Hi, I  just got this phone a few weeks ago because my friend recommended it to me especially when he heard I was willing to spend between 400$-500$ for a new phone. I spend a little over 200$ & man is it worth it! Do some research on this phone and if you're on a budget or not, get this phone because you won't regret it! ;;;;;this smart ass is so far the most impressive phone around as it lives up to the expectations of an s5 but at a lesser chicken...now thats what i call smart;;;;;I bought this phone to play about with as I go from apple to android and even windows twice but I'm sticking with this for a while now. Think its brilliant. They could charge double. Was only £100, Sorry apple 5c you can sit in my draw with your poxy 4 inch display. This 1080 HD screen. Octa core, Dolby sound, big 3000 battery & 16gb + 32gb card is stunning. I'd buy another tomorrow. Sorry moto g too. This just became my all time favorite toy. ;;;;;We've had a 25% failure rate on deployments for this model - a shame considering the price for offerings. ;;;;;Hi lads, are you sure about OTG support?  Got the phone and Sandisk Dual USB drive, no luck at all,  PS that drive working perfectly with Samsung S4;;;;;Getting this phone for Christmas, reviews look really good, looking forward to upgrading to this phone.;;;;;Perfect phone.;;;;;blue only;;;;;It is a great phone if you are upgrading from a old phone  then this device would be outstanding for the money and even if your downgrading from a new phone out it will still perform like a i phone 6 + it is a great phone for a Christmas present and the screen wont disappoint great phone 10/10   ;;;;;Likewise...wish could get one. Vodafone are selling a duo sim one but not seen it here. I currently ve a Smart 4 Mini with no secondary camera so pic quality is poor.;;;;;Bought this phone few days ago. Price is even better now £100 for the phone + £10 top up. If you top up £20 you get 50 GB of data to use for 30 days.  I also have Samsung Galaxy S6 and compared to this Voda is very good value for money. Speaker and camera quality good. Screen excellent.  Voda is little bit slower in performance than S6 but this is excpected.  Unlocking costs £2.50 on Ebay lol.  If people knew how good it is, Samsung and Apple would be worried.. ;;;;;will this be updated to 6.0;;;;;That is all I had to hand at the time,it is a 128gb Samsung Evo micro-sd XC with a little I or 1 in bottom right corner, this is link to exact card,  Noticed no slow down or anything unusual did not even think about it just stuck it in slot and away I went for the month or whatever had it. ;;;;;So does the 128gb micro SD card work in this phone as I read specs here it says only up to 64gb micro SD card. Please reply back I want to know if it accepts 128gb micro sd card;;;;;Ha I would not pay £20 to unlock just for £2.50 unlock on eBay uk ;;;;;hi uk ..i have already this phone and the sund is realy good , you should replace;;;;;rly gud;;;;;Hi.Please can anyone comment on the sound and call quality?.I have read it's low+distorted?.Looking to buy this urgently to replace Samsung Galaxy S2 which i am happy with the sound quality of but sick of constant charger port repairs.

There is a useful video on how to do this on the site, and vodafone keep you updated on the progress of your request. it costs £20. i did it, now on giffgaff.;;;;;I gt my smart prime 6,,, in portloaise in ireland,, i live in fairgreen,, i love it gr8 user experience;;;;;Can I unlock ultra 6 and use another sim card?;;;;;How to acquire one from Uganda? ;;;;;This phone hasn't got to Nigeria. I've searched for it buh, I still haven't seen it. Please any Idea on how I can get it? Maybe online or whatever way.;;;;;*Best lack of money can buy.;;;;;Very good and cheap bruv;;;;;it's nice............;;;;;Vodafone smart Ultra 6 which Colour do do you like silver or Gray? with galaxy s4 you can easily get custom roms and unlock the boot loader. so you can get Marshmallow update android 6.0 easily on Galaxy s4. with Vodafone smart Ultra 6 will be hard to unlock boot loader and get Custom ROM's to get android 6.0. but time will tell if Vodafone will update they phone to latest update. if am wrong let me know.;;;;;vodafone;;;;;Would depend on what you use it for...still trying it out as only got recently but i found the screen a lot better...battery lasted a bit longer, pictures on the camera seemed to be nicer. Call quality i found great if i put it on speaker phone it was a lot louder. Disadvantage would be performance is not quite as good does stutter. And there is a load of little things like hover to preview and little things like that the S4 does have which the ultra 5 does not (though with the S4 it had things like eye scrolling which for me never worked) ;;;;;I dunno if this phone has reached Nigeria? I would have loved to get it if it has, but, i'm having mixed feelings since the battery is in built and it uses one sim.;;;;;galaxy s4 model i9505 refurbished is £125 from Ebay vs Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 £125 both have Android 5.0.1 update which one is better?;;;;;Thanks for the tip;;;;;Corning Gorilla or some scratch resistant display?

Thank you.;;;;;Best value for money phone!!!! ;;;;;any update to Android 6.0 marshmallow update? or any costume Rom's available ?;;;;;yep;;;;;Very good value for money.;;;;;But, the phone's battery is in-built. Isn't it?;;;;;Got this phone this morning and i would say its on top of everything considering the price. Thanks vodafone for making this phone available.;;;;;Will buy this phone or asus zone 2 please replay which one is batter;;;;;No. Go into Options, Storage, three dots in the corner, USB computer connection, turn MTP on.;;;;;Hello! How to connect the cable to the smart ultra 6.  You need some software?;;;;;After disappointment with my Sony z5c I sent it back and bought this to put me on till Nexus 5x arrives. Cannot fault it except bit to big for me. Does everything even camera results are more acceptable than z5c . On my box it does state it accepts a 128gb card which is great just stuck mine in out of z5c for now. Nice bright screen always available 3 android touchscreen buttons lit in blue. In fact it could look like iPhone 6 plus if your budget is low and want a lookalike. How they built all this lot for 125GBP is amazing.It even has NFC because on set up process is said tap to exchange data off other android which is NFC action and yep it has it.Vodafone could be subsidising this I suppose,it even has 3000mA battery. Easy a 400GBP sim free device.;;;;;Picked this up 2 weeks ago after my Xperia Z3 screen cracked. Can't say I've noticed any real difference in the quality between the 2 considering the price. Very few complaints and they're only niggly stuff (no proximity sensor for calls etc). For the price you pay, this is an absolute bargain.;;;;;Just a heads up, the Android version is 5.02 but the phone runs smoothly and the price product balance is really good. The headset that you receive with the phone is bad quality, I am using my old in ear headset.The GPS runs great, I have installed the latest NFS-NL, Corridor Z, Clash of Clans and Dead Trigger 2 and all are running great. The battery life time is not that great even though it is a 3000 maph. The 4G runs properly and the signal antenna is fine.;;;;;If you buy it online from vodafone website, you will only pay £125. No £10 topup is needed if you buy it online. Select keep using my own sim at the bottom and you will be good to go. ;;;;;I have HTC one m8, but wanted to get Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 for my mum. i think Vodafone is out of stock.  i didn't see it on the shelf. where is the best place to buy it from which is in stock not paying more then £125.;;;;;Have this phone for few days now. Does not get 'hot' but sometime after heavy use, it gets little bit warm around the camera but that is perfectly normal. About the lag, it depends on what mobile phone you had before. If you ask me, this phone does not lag as such. Given the price, its the fastest phone. Even Galaxy s6 lags now and then. I do not have any complains about lagging. Excellent screen. Best battery life i have ever had from any mobile phone. Cameras are surprisingly good. Excellent selfies but in low light, main camera is a bit average. Overall its a great mobile phone. In £99 i have a 13mp autofocus cam, 3000mah battery, 5.5"" fhd lcd, 5mp front cam, mem card option. All sounds too good to be true but it is.;;;;;Does the phone lag or get very HOT? And how is the battery life? I heard its the best budget phone in UK?;;;;;excellent value for money better than Iphone 6 not tied to apple . ,lightweight ,big memory ,excellent sound system ,great camera updateable. over all excellent phone buy it now.;;;;;No, it does not have a gyroscope sadly.;;;;;I've not found it easy to scratch. Screen is quite resilient, and has coating to resist fingerprints. It is not gorilla glass to my knowledge, but certainly OK.;;;;;It has NFC, USB HOST etc. Screen can be relatively easily scratched. Beautiful phone. Up to 128gb Micro SD. Currently upgradeable to Android 5.0.2.;;;;;Their are two colours available, from my voda store. You can unlock device, it seems to be a zte. It is better than iPhone 6 plus, camera by far better. Plus you get NFC, for touch and pay...if voda have sorted that out and not insist on you sticking a tag on their NFC enabled phones??;;;;;Their are two colours avail;;;;;Vodafone smart ultra 6 300$, Samsung Galaxy A7 510$, Htc desire 820 430$, Sony M4 aqua 370$. There is no chinese phone with snapdragon 615 in turkey. ;;;;;Only app lock don't work with this phone its security issue it need to be fix you can't secured your photo or videos;;;;;No;;;;;No there is only one colour;;;;;Lags in transitions. Anyone else experiencing it? Otherwise the display is gorgeous. Hope it gets an update to marshmallow.;;;;;I got it from Vodafone NZ too, but it was free on a plan. I'm actually really happy with it. Value for money it's exceptional. One pleasant thing worth mentioning is that it supports OTG out of the box, so I can mount my USB thumb drives. Makes sharing stuff around a bit easier. No other phones in this price range with a big display, plenty of power, good battery, lots of storage options AND 4G/LTE. I was looking at an S6, but for $900 more I couldn't justify the spend just so I can brag about having the most expensive phone. It's a no-brainer. 4.5/5! If it supported the 700mhz LTE band and had a sturdier build quality I'd give it a 5.;;;;;thanks, has the LED have only 1 colour (blue) or multicoloured?;;;;;go into storage nd click top right to see option to enable to connect to the comp as a USB.  so you can transfer ;;;;;Have you tried tapping build in settings about to get into developer mode and enable usb debugging? - might work;;;;;can I unblock it because I want to use it in another country, please?;;;;;What is the screen made of?  There is no detail re the screen glass above.  ;;;;;Not really sure about airdroid, call me critical and cautious, but i really dont like giving 3rd party apps my details/letting them view files etc. google cloud photos are probably almost the same, but at least google is large international company. ;;;;;how or where do I get one to buy in Ghana. place ;;;;;First of all, Turkey comes installed with version 5.0.2. You can't see the percentage of battery remaining. Modified according to Vodafone the SMS part. 3 GB of RAM and Processor Speed should be 2000 MHz.The graphics card in games can be weak. You need to update the phone version 5.1.1.;;;;;Thanks.. but how it going? i mean pulse...;;;;;Same here;;;;;yeah it does have the circle led on phone glows;;;;;That's in dollars and why is over priced when its got middle range specs.   The whole point of having a budget price with higher than expected specs;;;;;Yes this as a nice notification light.  The center key at the bottom flashes;;;;;I have a question...has it a notification led? ;;;;;Install Airdroid, a free app which connects to your PC via wifi and will allow you to transfer files to and from the phone (or any Android phone) with ease.;;;;;Brought one through Vodafone NZ where it is not locked to a plan or Vodafone ($299 NZD). Actually really good. Was looking at an LG G3, but this comes quite close. Battery on light usage is lasting me 3-4 days. Camera - sometimes the focus is not great, but when it is the photos look great.;;;;;Cases on eBay now;;;;;Cases on eBay now;;;;;Airdroid:   Or use ES File Explorer:   on device, and set up remote manager, use FTP [Filezilla] client on PC/Laptop....;;;;;Very good, for the specs. In Programmer mode, How to Debug thru USB on it since no drivers found noware! Any sugestions? Tks;;;;;haven't you heard of syncing?dropbox?onedrive? connecting thru cables its so 2008,google it if u dont know how to do it...;;;;;I have just purchased this phone - have you found out how to download to laptop/comp yet ?  the phone will be of no use to me if I can't download - Thanks;;;;;330$ in Turkey. Overpriced. Same spec devices tagged samsung are around 370$, tagged HTC 350$. China brands under 300$. ;;;;;Great phone - when will cases or covers be available?;;;;;Stunning value for money.  Nothing else comes close.  A silly power button location is my only complaint.;;;;;go to storage click 3 lines top right choose usb ;;;;;you need to go into setting, then storage, then top right hand corner, click, the use as media device;;;;;Can you put music on it?;;;;;This phone have LTE connections;;;;;In specifications it lists that it has Bluetooth so probably yes. ;;;;;Husband and I both bought these phones this week and cannot view/download etc on PC/laptop. Can someone please explain this? Is this a fault (ours or phones?)? or is there something else we need to do instead? ;;;;;Does this phone sync with a 2013 Ford Focus Eco Boost;;;;;The phone takes a sd card up 128gb.not 64gb.it works fine on my phone with no lag at all.;;;;;hold the power button and the volume button at the same time;;;;;Hi , can someone please tell me how to do a screen shot on this phone please? Ta;;;;;Thanks!;;;;;unfortunately, no;;;;;Yes, press the power button and the down volume key;;;;;Does it have a gyroscope??? can I use it with google cardboard? Thanks;;;;; I use this phone for last week its good overall battery life amazing screen bright but only perblom I cannot connect to my computer and I canton use as WiFi hotspot;;;;;Does anybody know if a screenshot can be taken using the Software (not the hardware buttons). Please answer. Thanks.;;;;;it has great cameras and the size of the screen is big aswell for those who like a big phone;;;;;It looks like  a very good phone.;;;;;Best money can buy. ;;;;;gud fone ;;;;;This batter than note 4 and screen very bright;;;;;The phone has no faults with it whatsoever. I had a Sony Xperia Z2 and it was flawless but then it died on me, so I purchased the Ultra 6 and it surprised me more than I could imagine. I suggest customers to purchase this if they are looking for a phone around the same value.;;;;;good value for money, found this video of some guy putting it through some benchmarks   I might get one.;;;;;Android Version 5.02;;;;;You made a mistake n phone specifications!!!This phone have LTE/4G connectivity. Best phone for that money!!!;;;;;It has compass.;;;;;I don't think so;;;;;Does vodafone give updates to its phones?;;;;;I wanna know too;;;;;Amazing phone. If you are looking for value for money then you've come to the right place!;;;;;Phone will go for $300. Is now available in your local Vodafone stores. I don't know a single phone out there for better value;;;;;OTG?;;;;;Phone has 4g.;;;;;i want it too. you know the value?;;;;;I don't want it;;;;;i want it","[datetime.date(2018, 3, 23),

Great battery time, great signal. Over 5 days with one hour of internet daily, 10 hours bluetooth and 2-3 hours of conversation. Great camera on daylight also, never blocked to need restart in one year of daily business usage. ;;;;;This phone is amazing. i have had it since November 2015 and it is worth the money. Also to ANYONE who is looking for a phone too root then this is a good device i rooted my phone 1 month after i got this. No problems. i have my own custom boot animation and other root apps and it still runs fine. (I use KingRoot) If you do root, you WILL loose your guarantee.  Pros: 1. Its Fast (for a budget phone 2. Its Cheap 3. Vanilla Android (No Skins like Samsung) 4. Big HD Screen 5. Good Camera for 8MP 6. Feels Comfy 
7. The battery lasts 2 days of constant use. 
8. Easy to root (Avoids Warranty) 
9. Very Responsive Screen 
10. Very Bright Screen
 
Cons:  
1. Can be laggy from time to time 
2. Not That much Storage (For me as i like heavily detailed games) 
3. 1GB ram (not enough to play new 2016 heavy games) 
4. It is not Virtual Reality Ready (needs Gyroscope)
 
Overall i am still stunned by this phone. I love Android.  
I REALLY recommend this phone for IOS or new users to get as it is cheap and can help you understand how to use Android;;;;;Am in uganda my phone failed to read sim cards  and when I tried to reset it failed to switch on, it stop on powered by Android. What is likely problem ;;;;;Great phone had two ... For one reason .... I like them fragile screens tho ;;;;;Is the Vodafone smart grand a good phone compared to the Vodafone smart prime 6;;;;;Great phone it has the snapchat filters, which I know some phones don't work with, it has worked well for me. Also it holds charge really well like once it reaches 5% it lasts for 5-10 mins for me sometimes.;;;;;I tried the smart 6 ss it looked a good buy. How wrong can you be. The phone takes me back to the very early smart phones that tried to take on Iphone. Its poor in just about every respect and typical of badly designed cheap alternatives (like this) the thought given to the user experience is non existant. Fill a small plastic case with cheap electronic components. Stick a screen on (cheap as poss) make it a phone using Android and sell it as a smart phone. Really avoid this phone. Its a waste of your time and your money.;;;;; ;;;;;Me neither.  Very happy with it.;;;;;Had the phone over 6 months and will change back to iphone.  The Bluetooth is particularly bad especially in the car (new Merc) whilst the wife's phone works perfectly as did my old phone. The device keeps hanging and very small memory.  All in all have decided enough is enough and its getting changed.;;;;;I must be the exception, I have never had a problem with mine;;;;;each time my web and text freebe ends whatever i have as credit vanishes after 3-4 texts and this happens again and again. The last time yesterday i had £8.92 credit. I made several local texts and my credit dropped to £3.62. Boy what a stunner!;;;;;I love it :p;;;;;Have this phone for almost a year now. had to replace the stock sms app cuz of sluggishness, and thats about it. Overall, great phone for its price.;;;;;hate it hate it hate it. Such a frustrating phone to use,  sluggish and constantly hangs.   I'm sure this phone will end up flying out the window soon.  You really do get what you pay for sometimes.;;;;;This phone stopped charging after a month and was replaced by Voda - they are forcing me to take second hand products now despite the fact this is against the CGA.  It's a nightmare, the second voda model they gave me also had issues with the homescreen disappearing - their branded models are crap;;;;;It has all been said before..this is the most awful phone I ever had. The specs are so bad that spotify can't play a song without crackling sound and hickups via Bluetooth. The combi processor and memory is dramatic. If only calling is what you want than it could do (barely) but anything actions towards a smartphone are a pain in the rear.;;;;;Phone is pointless can't for the life of me view my pictures in the gallery as they don't show up even though they show up on my laptop, rang Vodafone to complain and got nowhere only called madam when I'm a man and then they hung up tried Twitter useless to and so is their web help Vodafone are useless. ;;;;;Well we have one for more than a year. And sins the android software has been updated its working much faster and also works very fast on wifi now.. And sound has been improved as well. For a phone that's only $125. It works very well. And is still the most sold phone in the Vodafone range. ;;;;;Rubbish loudspeaker sound, bottom part of digitizer works rubbish also, don&#539; buy this brick;;;;;A pile of dung use it as a spare and in fairness it does tide me over. but it's v.slow, camera doesn't always save pics. doesn't have enough power to open videos at times (instagram) really just an emergency phone;;;;;Threw mine in the bin within 2 weeks of receiving it. A truly awful phone.;;;;;I take photos but when I check my folder it's saying nothing is in the file?;;;;;Touch problem it has been broken and half of de touch is not working;;;;;Yeah im having the same problem and only got it last week.. On my second phone!!!;;;;;The battery is non removable on smart prime 6;;;;;The is non removable on smart prime 6;;;;;Yep I think its rubbish how you can't move things over to your sd card and when you try you end up doubling up on items like your music and photos.Now and then my fone flickers on and off then I have to shut the fone down then start up again to get it running. Value for money?? I DOUBT IT!!!;;;;;Totally agree!! Can't move anything to sd card when you try it doubles up what your trying to move to your sd card. eg:music, photos. Not the best is all I can say. Value for money?? I DOUBT IT!!!;;;;;my son has had this phone for nearly a year, and has never had a problem with it of any kind. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone looking for a low to mid range inexpensive phone, it has a great screen for the price, and is user friendly.;;;;;must be a last-grasp HTC mobile;;;;;I totally agree, brutal rubbish phone, keeps freezing, switching itself on and off, only have it 6 months and it's been rubbish from the first day.  DON'T BUY IT!!;;;;;I have this phone for 9 months.  Its not great.  I have to shut it down several times a day as it constantly freezes and I cannot answer calls.  It is very slow.  I have cleared nearly everything off the phone.  So its not loaded with apps.  Would not recommend it.  Also will not restart sometimes, just get a blank screen;;;;;anybody know why it keeps saying network error retry when i have wifi,only just got it and havent a clue i,ve tried everything would be grateful for an answer  thank you;;;;;this phone is only a basic phone .;;;;;Well this phone is absolute rubbish. First it has a micro SD card slot yet you cannot move anything to the sdcard and 2; the battery is NOT removable for Â110 it is rubbish .At least with my old phone Huawei y 550 I could move things to the sdcard .the only way to move things is to remove sdcard insert into a computer then pug phone into the computer and copy from phones internal memory to the sdcard a lot of hassle for such a highly praised iPhone clone ;;;;;i have same phone mines been ok for last 6 months x;;;;;I got my phone 4 days ago & its already freezing all the time and I gotta run the phone out of battery until it can unfreeze because I don't wand to reboot it and lose all my stuff. Love the camera but that's about it;;;;;My phones screen not working n i cant even turn it off...so wat can i do;;;;;My phones screen not working n i cant even turn it off...so wat can i do;;;;;I brung my vodafone 895N from new Zealand to Australia.... and i have no reception.... can someone help me please;;;;;Phone has locked and no helpful advice from Vodafone store or help line. Connect phone to computer was mentioned but store couldn't do it. Why?;;;;;Bad phone have 2gb left due to sim card and apps and phone still slow camera doesn't work sometimes sometimes work good other times wait 5 minutes for thing to load. Not a good phone but it is cheap enough so can't complain;;;;;Take note that it is upgrade-able to Android 5.1;;;;;I get 9 hours screen on time on a single charge, can easily last me two days if I do basic housekeeping, even longer if I become meticulous. Try disabling radios when you're not using them, dropping your screen brightness (take it off Auto), clearing recent apps when you put your phone away for a while, and let WiFi go to sleep while your phone ""sleeps"".;;;;;Proximity sensor is located between front speaker and front camera.;;;;;I have no idea what you have been doing with your phone, I've had this phone almost a year and I have had none of the problems you have mentioned. So slow and sluggish? What apps are you putting on it? If you're loading the phone up with your Facebook rubbish and chock full of mobile games that constantly play ads, push notifications and consume power in the background, then of course it will run terribly. Do you manage your storage properly, not letting it get too full, do you clear your recent apps when the phone gets a bit slow? Did you even run software updates when you got it? Sounds like you did none of this. Protip, no phone ""just werks"", not even an iPhone or a Sony or whatever brand you like to mention, they all have bugs, they all get updates shortly after release to fix problems, and all companies botch releases or have the odd faulty unit. ""Spend a bit more money buying a proper brand"" Saying this has made you sound so silly. Alcatel or TCT Mobile is a proper brand, and they make more than phones. Take your snobbery and ineptness elsewhere.;;;;;I don't get what people are talking about, I've never had a problem with this phone, has never overheated, never freezes, doesn't ""black out"" whatever that means, runs smoothly for me, apart at the beginning where it just needed updating. And not once do I need to restart it during the day. @LN;;;;;What Elain said, slow, sluggish blacks out, wont action commands until minutes later.  One word.. Rubbish!;;;;;Hi you have to hold the turn on botton.on the side next to the volume.. for a few seconds maybe more then it will reboot.Also i found out that if you dont remove stuff that you have been looking at it will drain battery.t do that push the square button and swipe off .;;;;;This phone is dreadful, I'm going to bin it and spend a bit more money buying a proper brand. I have to restart it several times during the day, it's sooooooooooooooo slow and sluggish, freezes far too often, doesn't respond to commands, basically useless. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, SERIOUSLY. You'll be so frustrated with it;;;;;Hello! Where I can download firmware for Vodafone Smart prime 6 (VF695) for full clean install!? Please Help!;;;;;Yes you do;;;;;You need a nano sim for it;;;;;Hello! Where I can download firmware for Vodafone Smart prime 6 (VF695) for full clean install!? Help please!;;;;;i can't figure out if there is any proximity sensor, i don t see any option about it, and it doesn't turn off the screen when i reach it to my ear. ;;;;;I couldnt get the charger to connect to phone so i smashed the phone the only fun thing about it;;;;;Poor device. Got it a month ago. Sometimes basic functions are a pain.;;;;;Operational manual is  rubbish - phone is not user friendly - absolute crap - do not buy !!!!;;;;;my prime 6 got hot and stopped working.What problem?;;;;;Got a new VodaSmartPrime 6 yesterday, Can't get my existing sim card inserted, The slot is not big enough to take it . Do I need a smaller or Micro Sim card. Please advise;;;;;The battery is worse than crap. You have like 2 thirds left on it in the morning, by late afternoon it's almost dead. Do ridiculous. I have to recharge it practically every day. Phone's great, it's just the rubbish battery.;;;;;network pin unlock for this model;;;;;My phone has totally crashed, can't do anything with it. How do I reset phone?;;;;;love this phone being using it for a while. thank you;;;;;can you get the screen fixed anywhere?;;;;;there are no proper instructions in the box, so I have to go back to the shop.;;;;;I bought one and it won't read Sim it sucks I have go get a blank Sim and try it this not cool because I kinda threw everything out no proof of purchase and I don't even know my number everything else work perfectly ;;;;;Bought it 5 months ago. It is worth the money, although the battery drains a bit fast. I have a problem with the new update and i cant connect to 4g networks, but even with 3g, this phone is worth the money. The cpu runs quite good, it is very smooth on the menus and it has a very good camera. The only problem is that its internal storage is mounted as sdcard0, and as a result you cant install apps on external sd. Im very happy with this phone and i am not going to replace it any time soon....;;;;;Is it waterproof? ;;;;;Can't use it..;;;;;I brought this phone a couple days back and I absolutely love it yes the camera could have been better but I got it for a really good price brand new I love it a lot compared to my other one which was a huawai asscend which I did not like ;;;;;the phone looks ok, nice design and quite light, the battery is pretty long lasting, good quality calls, be it phone or other apps, loud speakers and that's pretty much all good about it. it comes with a shitload of preinstalled apps. doesnt have the option to reorganise the menu items and i even had problems downloading apps on it. for example at some point it said it downloaded an app for 2-3 hours and it was just a 25mb one and my internet speed was good. doesnt let me move some apps on the sd card for no apparent reason camera is claimed to be 8mp. either it's not or (most-likely) the compression is too big and it makes the pictures look rather grainy  it also doesnt have the option to move or copy my contacts to and from the phone and SIM card. this can only be done individually. When it wants it can move pretty ok, including the internet surfing and the switch between apps (not too fast but at least gets the job done), but I had it freeze so many times and generally fuck up everything that I preferred to open my laptop to reply to a fb message. My advice would be to save some more money and buy a better phone. This one is cheap and non-reliable, and I'm not saying it's cause it is a Vodafone phone, as from my experience the quality is pretty much directly proportional with the money spent, regardless of brand.;;;;;I blame myself for buying this in a rush when I was broke instead of waiting an extra week and buying a proper one. As mentioned in the above comments the camera is terrible, however what do you expect for this price. The main problem is that the normal telephone functions are very poor. I don't care if the camera is shit but if I have to struggle everytime I use the phone it doesn't really work...;;;;;I bought this brand new and I could tell within ten minutes that this phone is some bullshit they threw together at the last minute, while wearing blindfolds! I never have 4G internet even though I paid for it and every area I am in has 4G coverage. I called Vodafone yesterday and they said they would fix it within 24 hours but it still says H+ when it should say 4G! Wtf is going on?! This phone is literally slower than my moms four year old Motorola RAZR M!!! This phone is garbage!;;;;;You can't remove the battery in smart prime 6;;;;;So slow charging phone, worst camera and I don't recommend tu buy this phone;;;;;Cheap and basic but even at that not worth the money. Spend an extra few quid and get something better. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!;;;;;ive owned this phone for 6 months, its very slow and freezes when using large apps such as facebook, messenger, instagram, and snapchat. its ok for the price though.;;;;;Hi Savanna, This freezing of the screen happens to me, very occasionally. I have been able to re-start my phone without having to wait for the battery to go flat. This may be of some assistance to you. The following link shows two methods to re-start, I have only been able to try Method 2:  Method #1 involves removing the battery, waiting a few seconds and then replacing the battery and re-starting the phone from the power button. However, the battery in my handset is not removeable. Consequently, I use Method #2....... The method that this link demonstrates, involves you holding down two buttons on the side of the phone until the re-start process starts. It feels like a very long time but it is only 10 (real) seconds, so be patient. The link shows you which two buttons to hold down. 
Good luck.

;;;;;The blue LED at the top left corner of the handset has two functions: 1) When connected to a charging lead, the LED lights up to tell you that your phone is being charged. 2) When you receive a text or eMail AND you have the LED Notifications option set to ON, the blue LED will flash about once every on and off about five seconds.

There was no instruction leaflet supplied with it. When I asked Vodafone customer services how I could get information on how to use the phone and its features I was referred to a list of specifications. This does not tell me how the various features work. I am not pleaed with Vodafone. This phone was recommended to me by Vodafone shop staff but it seems I have a phone I cannot use until someone shows me or tells me how to use it. eg I can use the keyboard to type the letters but not the numbers.

Vodafone,Smart first 6,";;;;;does anyone know what to do to open a mms on this phone? ;;;;;I got this phone 2 years ago and it was completely crap .It was lagging from the first day, it doesn't have a flash so I switched to huawei p8 lite which is a much much much better option;;;;;I do have a Vodafone smart first 6 I know the camera is not the best but would like to know how to transfer the photos from the phone to my computer ;;;;;Don't buy it coz it's crap, you would be wasting ur money. It gets worse as the months go. It's quite a problem.:-@;;;;;What did you expect from a phone that only cost £30? You make no sense.;;;;;Crap, avoid if possible.  I was originally looking for a specific cheap smart phone which my friend had purchased at Asda. Hers was cheap and cheerful at £40 , and worked remarkably well. Unfortunately, that particular phone had sold out, so I decided to spend that £40 on this instead.  Big mistake. Was glitchy from the get go, including on basic call/text functions. Most incoming calls cause the screen to freeze, by the time it unfreezes, I've missed the call.  Camera is crap.  Keyboard is crap (and has these weird, inefficient glitches). Memory is crap.  Touch screen can be crap.  Speed is crap.  
And battery is most definitely crap. 
 
If I knew all of this, I would not have wasted my money..which could have gone towards a better phone, or on the cheap and cheerful alternative I originally set out to purchase. 
 
Add that onto the fact that the Voda pay and ho network is also a pile of crap, and here we have the most recent and persistent bane of my life. 
 
Never buying Voda hardware again, and never opting into the network again either. 
 
Why are they even in business? Leave it to the pros, yo.

This will bring up a panel showing all of that person's details (phone numbers, eMail, street address etc.). 4) Select the phone's Menu button. IMPORTANT: This is the right-most button of the three printed buttons at the bottom of the phone, and which looks like an empty square. Selecting this button will cause a pop-up menu to appear. 5) Select Delete from the pop-up menu. You will then be asked to confirm that this entry should be deleted. I hope that this helps. 
Downunder Dave.;;;;;Hi Angry User, I suspect that if you are not getting more than 2-hours running time from a 100% charged phone, the battery may be faulty and you should return the unit to whoever you purchased it from. If after charging for a few hours and not doing anything with the phone, just letting it charge, the phone does not show 100% in the top right hand corner of the screen, there is either a problem with the battery or the wall socket supplying the power. Try charging the phone on someone else's cable and wall socket and see if that makes a difference. I reckon that the Smart First 6 is a pretty good, entry level phone for its price. As for whether it is user-friendly or not, a lot of that is down to the Android operating system. If this is your first Android device it may take a few days to get used to. Try and find someone else with an Android phone and look for help there, that is what I did. I hope that this helps. Downunder Dave.;;;;;Colette, You can download the English version of the manual for this phone (Vodafone Smart first 6) as a .pdf from:  or  In the past when these manuals have been distributed with the boxed phone they have been so small that they are hardly readable without a magnifying glass, so the .pdf ends up as a better option.  I hope that this might help you recover your phone from the Christmas dustbin....... 
Good luck,
 
Dave.;;;;;this battery doesn't last for more than 2 hours and its not a user friendly fone,its crap really;;;;;No Manual for a first time Smart phone... how ridiculous.... and battery life is CRAP.

It's so basic that Vodafone seems to think you don't need instruction manual - how do you open, fix problems? Lots of problems working out how to do anything.  Lousy camera and  when texting you often have to hit screen ""send""  4 -5 times before phone registers to send text. .;;;;;There is a problem with touch screen. Pinch to zoom is quite painful with one hand, when crossing axis issue appear. It is slightly better with both hands for no apparent reason, but screen also doesn't react to stylus well so drawing in it is almost impossible and also typing is difficult since most of the time it register tap next to the finger. Otherwise it's a fine phone for the money when you just want to use it for simple things like v communication and internet. Screen is surprisingly sharp and system itself seems quite fluid even though opening apps and multitasking lags for most of the apps (especially Skype). Apps can be installed on SD card and almost all apps from store can be installed but not all of them works. Games are payable even GTA San Andreas;;;;;I bought this for my mum, she just needed a basic phone. Without an instruction booklet we can't even switch it on let alone find out how to open it to put the battery in. Why do they not issue instruction booklets?

Also wanted to use banking application.   I was having issues with stuff downloading itself, so turned the Wifi off, and took it to a vodafone ninja, who told me there was porn on it because some one had used my internet to access porn.  I live alone.  I have not accessed porn.  The ninja removed a number of apps, no idea how, wouldn't tell me.  So left Wifi off until today when I wanted to look at bank balances.  Enabled WIFI, went to download banking app.  Told me it's already installed.  Wow, really?  Cannot find anywhere where it is stored on the phone.  Gave up, canned WIFI. Now every time I go to answer a txt, there is a flood of offers, games, porn, other stuff...   I have not downloaded any of it, have the settings set so it needs to ask first, and as well, keep getting a message to tell me to change settings so stuff can download.  Bit frustrating to have to cancel 6 or 7 of those before you can answer a call. Am disillusioned about the phone.  Would not recommend to anyone.  Will take it back to a vodaphone ninja this week, and if it doesn't improve I am going to can vodafone after having been a loyal person since 1998.

Smart Phone Power says it's Alcatel 985N. UK : I prefer European budget brands as  Alcatel as the LTE & 3G chips works better. I've had budget Chinese Huawei G535 Kestrel two times, both times poor LTE, 3G. I had better 3G than Huawei with cheap Alcatel Pop C1, SPop. Alcatel CHEAP TO UNLOCK £1 on eBay. Sony, Blackberry £15-£30 to unlock.
 
Alcatel my favourite budget phone brand.
 
3000MAH battery on Smart 4 Power makes it the best phone on the market for battery life : 
because it's screen is just 940*560, processor just quad core 1.2ghz. 
This is fine by me as I'm not power user. 
I bought it because of battery life and 5inch screen.
 
Really like 5 inch screen. Get WHOLE 5 inches cause home button is on the bezel not on screen. 
Eg. Sony looses 1/2 inch cause home button is on the screen on Sony's.
 
Front camera is just VGA 0.3MP it should have been at least 1MP. 
Storage just 4GB it should have been 8GB. 
Can add storage by microsd.
 
NFC really like which is unusual in a budget phone.
 
Was £80 from Vodafone now £100. 
£55 grade B & £60 grade A from CEX Entertainment Exchange. I bought mine from CEX grade B.
 
My favorite 4G budget phone is this smart 4 power.
 
The only phone I would exchange Smart 4 Power Alcatel S7 for is Alcatel S9 which has full 6 inch screen, HD screen, 2Mp front camera, 3400MAH battery.

PRO + Price : cheapest 5 inch on the market by far + Proper 5 inch screen : get whole 5 inches with Android buttons outside screen on the bezel. Better than Sony, Lg, Samsung, Huawei 5inch as they all loose 1/2 inch cause android buttons on the screen taking up 1/2 inch so they all are actually 4.5 inch. + 3000MAH battery : 4 days standby, 2-3 days normal use, 12hours continual video on YouTube. + NFC : very useful but keep it turned off until required to save battery. + Very little bloatware.
 
CON
 
-Low screen resolution : not even HD but this helps battery life last long 
-Low quad core processor mediatek : its not snapdragon, not even 64bit snapdragon 410. But this helps battery life. 
-Low graphics Mali400 : cheap tablets have this. But this helps battery life. 
-VGA 0.3 MP front camera : not even 1MP , eveb video chat is unclear. 
-Speakers low : even full volume. 
-4GB storage : cmon that is pants 8GB is cheap 
-32GB max microSD capacity: cmon with just 4GB storage, atleast 64GB microSD was required.


 
Summar 
Best low cost phone for someone that wants looong battery life, large screen. 
And is not a gamer nor power user.

;;;;;This is a pretty good phone. Verry good battery perfomance. It last between 2 and 4 days of usage. Screen is also good, with decent viewwing angles. It annoys me the low internal memory. Only 4gb... In games, such Real Racing 3 and Temple run 2, it runs smootly, enought for you to have a good experience with it. For 150$, i say is the best phone on the market right now.;;;;;I am very happy with my phone . I would like more info send to my e/mail regarding instructions;;;;;You can't use WiFi on airplane mode because airplane mode is for when you're in an aeroplane, meaning that airplane mode is designed so that when you turn it on, no Wireless connections can be made on the phone, preventing it from interfering with any part of the plane. So, there is no solution. If you want to use WiFi, turn airplane mode off. Hope I helped :D;;;;;Yes.Sometimes I get bad reception and my phone uses more battery to try and boost the signal.So I would like to use airplane mode since I use wi-fi almost all the time.;;;;;Are you for real? ;;;;;Hey ,I can't use WiFi on airplane mode.

Good luck!!;;;;;that is true, if you dont use the phone that much the battery lasts longer;;;;;phone cannot be rooted as tried vroot, towel root, etc and nothing im curently using apex launcher with stealh icon pack and looks excellent;;;;;Why would I lie? I just don't use it very much because it's my second phone, maybe one hour of screen on time per day. And I keep the wifi and 4g off unless I need it. Obviously if I was using the internet or playing games it would drain faster. But 3000 mah and a sub-HD screen is a recipe for a long battery life, and so far that's proved to be the case. I'll do a battery benchmark test and let you know the results;;;;;now 3 days without a charge and still at 87% is a lie maybe u just bought yo fone 4 display purposes only;;;;;hello, at the moment ive orderd a micro sd card so ill update on this shortly, yeah ive tried ebay aswell and none exist so go to unlockmobiles.com then go to the drop down menu at the top and for the provider id put one - not two -- and within a few hours type your imei number and email address in the tracking section as email seems to be slow..;;;;;Thanks for your post! Also picked up a black one for £100 last weekend. Very pleasantly surprised! Bought mainly for the battery life which so far is outstanding - been three days since last charge and it's still on 87%. Glad to hear it can be unlocked (couldn't find codes on ebay but will try that website).  There's a review on the vodafone blog (""Hrym's first impressions"" if you want to search for it) that says that the file manager can bypass kitkat's restrictions on moving files to the sd card, including apps. Have you tried moving an app to the sd card yet? Any joy? Let us know if you have any success rooting with vroot or towelroot etc;;;;;bought the black version and white version at vodafone instore for £100 each due to the weekend sale thats gone by. unlocked the white version at unlockonline site and within 6 hours is fully unlocked for any network and costs just £4.90. the phone is a beast and holds firmly, will be uninstalling the vodafone apps as they are useless, app mgr or app 2 sd application dosent work on android kitkat but you can put game data, music, video etc on the micro sd card. rooting device should be easy with either vroot or another alternative. will be happy to answer any questions;;;;;Standart Smart phone ;;;;;Hello, can you tell me if you can save app's and files in the sd card? I've read that the android 4.4 kitkat does not allow to save app's, photos, videos to the sd card. Thank you;;;;;I just bought one of these today if anyone has any questions. First impressions: build quality much better than expected, feels really solid and has a nice weight to it. Screen is really bright and crisp. You can uninstall a lot of the preloaded apps. Inbuilt file manager lets you move apps to sd card without needing apps2sd.

Vodafone,Smart 4,";;;;;Not to be rood dude but all smartphones ive had the pleasure of using do the clock thing - sorry for the camera and calculator problems, but thats pretty much just your phone. Lag will happen to all smartphones, from what I've seen as far as to the ones with 1gb ram. Im pretty positive its something to do with the software, the camera thing  Also why not get a newer model now - 6 has 1 gb ram and 2mpx front camera, and autofocus, and is in about the same price range, or free with a plan. ;;;;;I was given this phone by a friend after my S6 fell in a pallet crusher at work. To start on a good note , it works. Calls texts Facebook WhatsApp ect all work jolly well. Camera is better quality than I expected with regards to picture , but getting it to work is another story. It often tells me camera is unavailable even after I close all tabs. The phone is slow and has very little memory , both hard drive and RAM , and many apps I found were rendered useless by the VodaSmart4. I found other niggling problems with the calculator and clock. The clock will stop recording time when the phone is locked using side button. So you lock the screen at 12.30pm it will still display 12.30pm if you check the time 2hrs later. It works as a temporary phone if your good smartphone is out of order and you didn't have to pay for it .. Don't part cash for something that is cheap for a reason.;;;;;Very good phone with so so rear camera and poor front camera;;;;;so its one of the cheapest phones on the market with a 5mp camera and a decent screen. works pretty well with what i need it for even if the 512 ram will quit background apps if the foreground uses too much memory. battery-wise lasts about as much as your average smartphone and its pretty fast on wifi. mine would randomly restart but seriously its a 2/10 price range phone, its not like i can give little money and expect the world. still better than many bootleg smartphones on the market ;;;;;Do not waste your money on this phone.

On the downside it's the camera which is the worst simply, design is really bad and it's really thick.After 2 years the battery with 2-3 hours of wifi, browsing and youtube doesn't last more than one day.

It's not really all that fancy (certainly won't hold a candle to IPhones and Galaxies and the like though). The camera's not the worst I've ever had, the phone is very easily usable. My only complaint is that sometimes its a little slow and I have to clear a lot of phone storage most times I want to install an app. There was one time when the phone was automatically opening an MMI Test app that was very intrusive. A factory reset fixed it which wasn't as bad a move as I thought because Google restored all my apps and contacts and such so no loss anyway.;;;;;This is the biggest rubbish ever made.

First I backed up everything I wanted to keep to my PC. I unmounted and removed the SD card (turn phone off to remove SD card) and then restarted the phone. I followed this by doing a factory reset. I went through setting the phone up again (I think there was an option to download the backup saved on google drive, I selected yes, which was a mistake, as I will explain), when this was all done I tried the update again, it downloaded and done the ""Software is checking"" scenario again which failed with the ""Data Error, Please try again"" message (which is obvious to me now, as the downloaded backup from google drive had put the phone back to where it was before the factory reset)....Start Again!!!!! As phone has very little on it, I turned off the backup to google drive (which also wipes the backup saved there), done another factory reset and started again, this time there was no option to download the backup from google drive(obviously), I finished, the setup process then tried the ""Software Update"" again (it still took a good while to download) but when it finished downloading, it went straight to ""software is checking"" and low and behold the phone rebooted and done the update (YEEEEHAAAA), I went through the phone setup process again, put the SD card back in and downloaded the apps and games that my son had on it before the update. All is good and everything runs fine, (it seems a little faster now but that could be my imagination). There may be a better way (one that doesnt lose all the settings and I'm sure there is someone on here who would know how), but this worked for me. 
I hope it helps
;;;;;I have had the exact same problem but have tried at least 10 times and the update 240HEG1 is 100MB on mine, the first few times it went as far as rebooting only to tell me the update zip could not be found, so I unmounted the SD card and tried again, now it just gives me the same error as you.

It's so fast (Good dual core 1.3 GHz processor), it has a GPS, it is great!

This phone is very powerful and it is the right choice if we need a Single SIM very fast mobile phone.

Happy Easter;;;;;In Czech Republic its on sale for around 70 incl. 10 prepaid credit  (and the phones are Unlocked in our country, even as prepaid sets). For that money its really not bad. I understand the strategy for the cheap compromise, so it has minimum RAM to run with no extras. But what would one expect for 60 right? ;-);;;;;I think a phone of this spec should av 1 gigbyte ram and flash. Id pay the little extra for that.

Vodafone,Chat 655,";;;;;I am using this as secondary phone. You have to press the keys really hard for typing and locking the device. The loudspeaker and call quality is really good,but the main Opera browser doesn't seem to work on WiFi networks. After switching to Flight mode and again going to Normal I managed to get old Facebook app working. J2ME games performance is really poor... only few games were playable in 30FPS with no lag.

I don't think that analogy is going to be too far off base.;;;;;Depends on what the user needs in this phone. 3D benchmarks are pretty awful for this chipset, but CPU benchmarks put this chipset somewhere between the Snapdragon 425 and 625 for performance. If gaming is an incidental concern, the battery sipping nature of this CPU along with it's lower price (compared to the Snapdragon series) actually might make this an interesting choice. Roughly $400 US dollars is a bit steep for these specs, but that monstrous battery might well make this a real option for non gaming folks, especially if they use a camera set that's more than just OK. With a mid to high tier camera, this makes for a social media beast with a good screen, good enough CPU power for most people's everyday tasks, and halfway decent performance with the occasional 3D game. I'm keeping my eyes on this... if for no other reason than maybe getting a social media and media consumption device that won't need constant charging.

As a company well known for its Battery module - with Energy 500 rigid outdoor looks - a 6,000mAh and 20MP shooter and 4GB 820 Snapdragon - would easily secured them a number ONE spot for being the best 'outdoor' phone and of course - a DEFINITE homerun!! who exactly were responsible behind all these models release?? - simply a moronic act, nuff said - and these kinds of people allow to be rich, jeezzz!!;;;;;Only things I like it long lasting battery, if you claim this then show it. Not showing at all.;;;;;They should launch 6,000 mAh model with ability to charge other phones.

Energizer,Energy 400,";;;;;Very good for rough use. But otherwise it is just a basic android phone. It cannot perform smooth performance because of the 512Mb ram. It has a small screen and little hard to read texts on the main menu icons. Also this is a very heavy phone, you can hit a man on his face with this and he'll start bleeding.  I didn't try to check it's shock-proof or water-proof ability. But I'm pretty sure it can defend against anything. The whole casing made with rubber, so it has a strong grip also. ;;;;;This is very good mobile, as a sri Lankan,I haven't facility of GPS,function on it.y it is not properly works in Asian countries,so that this mobile not fulloptionable to me,suddenly it is turn of when it goes over heating level,otherwise this good 4 hard use;;;;;Better than the 240 100 and 200 bit worse than Energy 500 yess more megapixels than any other Energy 200 100 240 and runs Android. 4.5 Stars;;;;;As of 20/1/17 my phone is under investigation as it appears to contain preinstalled malware from ADUPS in China. If you have one of these my advice is to check it out carefully. Google Adups malware BLU phones.;;;;;Re branded phone.
