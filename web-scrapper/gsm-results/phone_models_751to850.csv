Iam a fan of xolo, I used 8X 1000 hive and now using Play 8x1100. Xolo should improve its service and replacements as these phones go slower in performance due to lack of software upgrade for the existing models. I am satisfied with xolo accessories and product worth of money. if they can improve replacements and service. They will grab huge market with their innovative competitiveness. All the members of my family only use XOLO for the features and camera performance. ;;;;;If phone got hang then wht we do coz battery non removable ;;;;;I ordered this product from gadget 360 but they failed to send in Darjeeling though the order had been placed twice.

Its totally waste of money. 6499 is not a small amount, single rupee also matters. I suggest, better choose good phone whoever thinking to buy xolo era 4k.  I am sure Xolo might have made thousands of crores by selling this product. Here the loser's are poor customers. Now Its a dream that company will provide the good quality phone replacement for the problems which are facing currently like worst camera with poor picture quality, phone hangs while playing the videos, internet v slow - compared internet browsing by using old xolo phone which is of low configuration and what not.  I am not finding a proper channel to complaint on ERA 4k phone. I remember couple of years before, Nokia provided replacement of phone and accessories for one particular model. even now XOLO should do the same or else XOLO is going to loss the brand image.  Dear XOLO, Market is very competitive, people are also intelligent enough to choose their needs. Now you might have win by selling low quality phone by good advertisements/speciation's but do remember its not the end and not always you can win.  Already people are posting lot comments on ERA 4k.  For the customers who bought this phone, Xolo should provide proper reimbursement/solution.  Regards, Xolo User.;;;;;hello everyone my suggetion my deep of my heart please dont buy this phone very very very very bad quality of camera and no one will support for your problem and if you call customer care they only make false  commitment i loose my 6499 rs please dont buy xolo era 4k i request you dont looose your money and time gadget 360 worst service they will provide and if you want to buy first check their policy because the policy is made for only customer fake everything is fake this is china model phone even they dont have return policy or refund policy ;;;;;yes. it support LTE service..4G .;;;;;U can use ur sdcard memory as for apk memory.

XOLO,Era 4G,";;;;;Do factory reset 3or 4 times continually;;;;;Ram hapler can damage my mobile... How can remove this in mobile..... ?????;;;;;My phone xolo era 1x is automatically shutdown takes place as..the temperature of battery has increased &switch offs in 15secs.. Another problem is some time it does not shows the contacts.;;;;;Use Flipkart 2amp charger;;;;; you do your phone  hard reset& restor;;;;;Pathetic touch response. Never buy xolo phones;;;;;Lost battery within 1 year.. Couldn't find, xolo battery.. Then bought LAVA battery (2500mAh for 950 in stores) fitted into mobile.. It's taking many hours to get charge(Almost 12hours for 40percent of battery).. Please help me on this issue.. ;;;;;Sir,I m using this phone.this condition is very well.but when I downloaded larger game from play store but his game obb not downloaded why? Please reply instantly;;;;;Get the system update, it works;;;;;Disable RAM helper..its a virus which s installed by xolo ...you can also scan phone by 360 total security it show u d virus;;;;;To all who complain about automatic software/application download and instal should Note that there are usually only two reasons for this to happen.  1. If game/application is installing when you are not using internet, then the mobile service provider is doing the instal and Balance cut without your knowledge. For this the mobile should not be blamed. The only options are complain to the service provider or change the service provider. 2. If game/application/software is downloading and installing while you are browsing the internet then it is possible that the website you are visiting is accidently or deliberately downloading the software. Many unscrupulous website download free apps or games as they want more and more users. Such downloads will not result in balance cut. You can usually see the download of the app/game in the download option of your browser.  3. If app/game gets downloaded when using browser and balance gets cut, then it means that the website you are visiting has links to the app/game which you have accidentally or deliberately clicked (touched) this problem is most in touch phones. Even if you are trying to scroll the Webpage and there are links there, it may get clicked even if that was not what you wanted. Tips: 1. Donot use any browser for a few days and see if apps still get downloaded. If yes then daily is with service provider. Complain or change service provider. 2. When apps get installed, check sms. If there is a sms, then probably you accidently clicked a link on some webpage. Donot blindly go to any webpage via search engines or links. 
Hope this helps. 
;;;;;The automatic software instal is because of the website you are going to. Some websites do an automatic download of software which is either virus or some application that they want you to use. Also, in websites sometimes there are links which if you touch ( even accidentally while scrolling) will cause software download and balance cut. One should visit only reputed websites. ;;;;;How to upgrade the this phone because I am also facing the problem of unknow source disable to enable and not use of 4g sim;;;;;Era of 4G October 2016 -- march 2017 paisa wasool  good for surfing internet I also use as a modem connect to pc via data cable nd download HD movies display nd touch average battery backup awesome in this mob use li polymer battery   overall in price 4777 this phone totally paisa wasool plz don't upgrade in marshmallow &#128077;;;;;;Mobile dont worth 5000rs and also mobile is hanging a lot, even sometimes when over heated it got off suddenly and restart itself.

Processor is quad core 1.5 GHz, which is amazing but if you are buying this handset I recommend don't fill the whole memory up that can lack performance. Battery is great 2500 mah it works really fine. Normal usage can end up about 11.45 hours. Camera is with dual flash but quality is poor. Works a little bit in perfect sunlight. Still camera is not good, I mean what you can expect more in that range of price. Finally if you are looking for a handset with dual 4g that also is valid with jio sim, with better battery backup and a sharp display this handset is made for you. Hope my opinion will help you and others. Thank you.;;;;;Yes it supports jio sim. Dual 4g support.;;;;;It does not support otg.;;;;;I am using this phone for now 2weeks.Games like Coc can be easily played infact, I am using 5 games.

Excellent Product from xolo. I selected Xolo black 3gb RAM because of SNAPDRAGON Processor. Iam able to produce DSLR like camera features with its rear dual camera. One has to know is right settings. This has good camera module with 120fps capability at low resolution 640p. No one should blame anything without knowing settings tweaking. In my Opinion Manufacturer just manufactures with some features but using them/selecting them in a right way with right settings is the best thing to be done in firstplace. This had Glonass GPS, GYRO, Compass interlinked which are costlier but got at a low price. No screen gaurd used NO scratches on front/back GORILLA Glass3.

Maybe you have something good and wrong with you (if the comment is genuine);;;;;worst phone ever, don't buy this phone ..every month I have to go service centre and very poor service of xolo company... All stafs  behavior of xolo service centre is very bad ........ battery backup too low...screen pining and takes 8 hours to full charge ........In my opinion I want to say xolo should not make any smartphone because they have no capability to give service to customers;;;;;This is the best phone which I am using from last 9 months. Display & camera quality is best one. Battery back up awesome. No heating issue. Only issue is memory card slot not avl. separately.;;;;;XOLOs worst product....

It is running on android 5.01 not 5.1 which is worst too. So Guys, dis is a detailed & honest review about dis mob from my side.

fast lock on gps 
supports USB otg for external storage 
packs more sensors for a 10k budget 
low budget phone considering specifications 
latest software update also supported 
front flash 
outdoor pictures are crisp in daylight 
good connectivity 
shining glass back 
lot of bugs fixed on second update
 
cons:
 
display started flickering recently. gets blank for few seconds then back again while data connections were on. never occurred to me while mobile data were off. got software flash from service centre. no problems till now
 
heating exists..but not too much a problem 
low battery backup for a 3gb ram mobile because of more processing power 
lacks fast charging which was necessary.. charging time is high. battery drains quickly.. battery optimization available on official update which is okay 
non removable battery pack 
no backlight for navigation buttons 
images does not capture details under low light.. average camera 
low sound output for music lovers both on loudspeakers and on headphones. only one audio vent actually produce output for loudspeaker 
glass back attracts scratches
 
a perfect choice below 10k budget.. i suggest 
stunning specs at this rate

Gives sharp detailed pictures.;;;;;Hi guys, I bought two phns bt one was defected,  and one is performing awsome,   If any body having issue with this fne and they want money back then just ask to xolo service center for ""job sheet"" insted of DOA letter,  they gave mi job sheet for my defected mbl and i got my money back U need to raise ur cancellation request within 7day from the dispath date Ex.if u booked ur mbl on 1 december and ur mbl handover to you on 6 December then 7 day return policy count from 6 December not from 1 December. And ask for jobsheet because xolo provide 7 day return policy from day of booking (including all holidays) and snapdeal provide 7 day return policy from the date of handover. 
So, if u got mobl on 7 day and requested for cancellation to next day means 8th day and  u visit to xolo care then they will not provide DOA letter to you, thats why ask them to provide jobsheet .
 
This all happened with me, pls note all this point if u want ur money retun

I recommend this mobile friend's.;;;;;Don't buy XOLO Black 1X ,there are many issue. 1) Battery Issue  2) Camera Issue (Given 13 MG pixel but very bad quality.) 3) Design Issue, (Showing different image on SNAPDEAL) 4) Heatting Issue (While playing any normal game or surfing Internet) and No. 5  SNAPDEAL promised to provide us 32 GB internal memory but getting only 25.4 GB . they are fraud. And if you will call to SNAPDEAL Customer care they will say,  go to service center and bring a confirmation letter for these issue. So my dear go to yr local market and buy any mob but not from SNAPDEAL, After today I will not purchased any product from SNAPDEAL. You can choose any other option like Flikart and Amazon. They will not ask you to confirmation letter for anything thing. 
THEY DONÂT BELIEVE OWN COSTUMER 
One more issue is there, if you insert memory card into it, your fovrite ringtone which set by you , will not work when someone calling you, mob will not able to decide default path for ringtone.

Its a lovely phone. Very lightweight and compact. Ui is not completely hive but has stock 5.1 look (i hate hive ui on friend's xolo omega). It Has an option to delete bloatwares and for me after some tweaks 2.3gb ram is available for use. No heating. No sudden battery drain in fact is effective even it has 2400mah. thanks to lollipop battery saving feature. Also it has smart battery saver which controls cpu when it is locked. Camera is poor in low light and blurry sometimes but in sunlight and indoor with proper light its amazing and captures images with vibrant colors. Gaming is good on asphalt 8. Very minor lags you will feel at start of race. Speaker sound is loud but with treble with very low bass. Ringtones is even louder and there is no issues with vibration also. Earphone sound it is normal as most of the mtk devices, no sound enhancement provided other than inbuilt fx. I use bluetooth headphones. Screen is vibrant and sharp. Phone does not lag at all, not even single time. I was unsure about mtk6753 chip before buying but now I'm feeling amazed. It is fast and can handle more than 25-30 tasks running at a time (provided u have uninstalled or disabled bloat and stock non usable apps like hangouts, google plus etc. I have checked each and every feature even voice typing and ok google which responds quickly. I could not signin into hive key or hive account any which ways it is not that useful. It has notification led which is very useful. Back cover glass is getting tiny scratches so i bought universal flip cover for it. DO NOT USE IT WITHOUT SCRATCH GUARD even it has dragon trail glass. About 4g and wifi it works like charm. 4g sucks battery like older 3g but wifi doesn't. I bought it for android m future update, ram and inbuild 32gb. About its price which is 10k even after cost cutting on non metal body, average camera it stands unbeaten and i guess it will stay for next 3-4 months just like xolo black. If you know how to use android i mean to say how to handle it to make it perfect then go for it. I can not compare it with other phones or makes as i never used other smartphone with these specs. If u don't know how to use ok google, Battery saving management, Camera tweaks, uninstalling unwanted bloats, how to set ringtone or copy contacts please do not buy it rathet buy some basic phone :p;;;;;frnds pls infmed me that earphone available with xolo black 1x  in Snap deal.;;;;;i dont know;;;;;pls check the snapdeal website as its not yet launched and people are giving review about phone.

Now a days people are not looking a brand name.. All are concentrating on quality product. Specifically, customers are checking the chipset, CPU latest processor, cores, RAM (DDR3/4), internal storage, Camera with true HD quality, screen resolution with above 400ppi, scratchless touch, heating and hanging issues etc In my own perception, xolo black x1 is loaded with top end features and can do best up the mark. but i have a confusion with cpu capacity. whether Mediatek, 1.3GHz Octacore processor is compatible to 3GB RAM? What is the process calculation? i think 2.2GHz Octacore is good for 3GB LP DDR3 RAM.  I request any mobile expert to clarify my doubt. whether it can handle multiple operations without hanging?;;;;;Is this phone have dual sim dual active.....? ;;;;;Friends I have purchased xolo black, the phone is suprb.

Yes&no.;;;;;Can I get offline;;;;;wat is satisfactory in ur opinion?;;;;;True. ITs a HIbrid SIM Slot. Both SIM 4G enabled, One at  a time of course. however if you want second SIM, then you would have to sacrifice SD card. Also internal is 32 GB. I have heard that you get atleast 24 GB free on first boot. hence i doubt you would need a SD card. ;;;;;Does both the sim (slots) of this phone supports 4G SIM or only one SIM supports 4G and other supports for 3G or below than 3G ?;;;;;Features look really great and could be worth at the given price.

If you check manufacturer of xolo then you will find that it is registered on snapdragon site.. Xolo is just selling these mobiles after purchasing from manufacturer.  Also who told you that I have to be registered on snapdragon to use it's processor... There are white boxes (no brand)  using snapdragon ;;;;;Bro how much money did karbonn gave you to promote their phone..........plzzzzz don't write fake comments like that I have been using it from 4 months....It have great camera with good clarity and awesome processor gta, asphalt 9 and nova 3 runs like butter. There is no heating at all. Well done xolo team and its UI is also great.;;;;;1) It's a ordinary china made handset. 2) Processor described as Snapdragon 615 but if you search Snapdragon.com, you will see the Xolo Black not registered in Snapdragon site. So, It is clear processor isn't made by Snapdragon. here xolo cheat with all buyers. 3) Battery described talk time as 30 hours but when you using this set, you will see battery drain within max 6-7 hours. Not any update realesed by Xolo or Hive team. 4) Camera is not so good as described. photo came good when daylight is very high. but in low light photo came as 3.2 MP camera. 5) Not upgrade option through OTA hub. Hive developers released Developers ROM for Xolo Black. if you install this ROM, then N then your warrantee would be void.  6) It price Rs, 12999/-. but, it's a max 5999/- category set.

The problem is a phone with this specification needs pure android or at-least close to stock like the HTC sense and so on, whereas XOLO Black runs on HIVE which could be a disadvantage.  The camera focus is really amazing but the problem arises during low light. Please fix the camera or at-least make is a superior one so that it gets in the crisp images. Dual Camera is almost useless because there are no options which I can change, Not sure if everyone has this issue or only me but please fix that because even flash cannot be changed. It gets a little glitchy when over used but it has 2 gb ram, the HIVE again could be a problem. Few bugs every once in a while. please fix that. having said the above, this is one of the best phones I've used. I'd give a 8 out of 10 for the phone even with these problems.;;;;;Love may mobail;;;;;Yo yo man;;;;;Really This is a very Poor handset i ever used in My Life.

Pl suggest how to resolve it. Thanx in advance.;;;;; The phone is Waste of money. I have used the phone for more than 30 days and following are my observations: 1) Performance is VERY BAD for normal usage.Phone get HANG most of the time despite having 2 GB RAM and Snapdragon Processor.. 2) Rear and front cameras are just OK. DUAL CAMERA is NOT working at all. 3) battery backup is OK if you use with cautions.  4) Phone looks premium  that's the only specialty of XOLO BLACK. Back glass is smooth and feels good in hands but is made of VERY LOW QUALITY GLASS getting lots of scratches and smudge despite being made of Gorilla GLASS and Oleo-phobic Coating.   5) Sound quality is Good. 6) Gets heat up in normal usage like playing games and using whats app Facebook and also during charging. 
7) HIVE-UI still needs to be developed much more. It cannot match the competitors out there 
8) No Updates Came yet as they were releasing Android 5.1.1 in August but still there is no update for XOLO BLACK.

All three are best in the price range they offer. But Xolo Black is best of all three phones. (This does not mean that I havent used any other brand smart phone, I have already used Moto G2, Nokia Lumia 520, Samsung Galaxy Core, Sony Xperia, and so on) The reason I say Xolo Black is best because, they provide the best features in an affordable price of 13K. I am not writing this opinion based of first look, I have used this phone for almost 15 days now, and I have tested this phone on almost all aspects. Pros:  Both front and back camera are super cool. The image captured will just amaze you.  Display is also best.(401 ppi) Design, reminds me of iPhone though, but the extra Gorilla Glass at the Back makes it look way cooler. Battery is good. I have used 3G for continuous 12 hours and phone still has 20% charge left. 
Apart from HD games the performance of the phone is super awesome. Switching between apps does not have any lag. 
Phone has good sound output.
 
Cons: 
Some times when you play high definition games the phone heats up. This goes same when you use the Navigation or any other GPS related app. 
You will find a rare lag while playing HD games. 
Its my first encounter with the Hive UI, and I felt it was kind of buggy. But after the phone got updated the lagging or buggy nature of the phone seems to be solved. 
You need to find a better gallery app. The default one is too slow.   
Hybrid sim, I felt it as something new, but since I used only one sim it was not that problematic to me.
 
Finally I would say Xolo Black is worth every penny you pay.  
And I just cannot compare this phone with iPhone, because iPhone is sold at the price of 4 to 5 times of the iPhone. 
 
So iPhone has to be amazing. 
 
And in its price range Xolo Black is amazing and awesome.;;;;;I am using this phone from 2 weeks and I found no major problem in this phone this is the best phone in price range of 13k its build quality is very high and its front as well as back is gorillaglass 3 protected Because its back side is of glass it looks very premium and its display is also very crisp and nice(bcoz it has 401 PPI IPS panel ) and its e book feature is really great it reduces maximum stane from our eyes  while reading and its camera is also nice and the 2 camera is for re focusing if you want more information about this phone see the unboxing video of xolo black in  there are many videos of this phone in youtube ;;;;;It's for depth sensing, it also helps to focus quickly.;;;;;It's not lagging now but still, in games, it's still lagging. However, XOLO assured us (users) that they'll solve the lagging issue via Android 5.1 update. They solved most of issues by just a little update, even it's no longer lagging on Photo Studio, lock screen etc., so expect that Android 5.1 will solve the lagging issue. :) ;;;;;Camera in XOLO Black is better than Mi 4i. I personally have both phones, however, front camera of Black isn't at all comparable to Mi 4i.;;;;;But why this phone has 2 camera i back side???;;;;;go with mi4i best of best camera for 12k price  xolo black and k3 note se 1000 times better;;;;;hello anybody i ask you in this month xolo solved this laggy problem ;;;;;Is there a slot for memory card;;;;;hi gyms yesterday only I bought this phone from flip cart in terms of look it's not that much owesom but features are good camera quality is pathetic so my openion is don't go with this product in this high price segment  k3 note is the best ;;;;;Guys, share your recent experience with Black after latest update!

Gorilla glass on both side is good but slippery.(need flip cover) Touch is smooth and good. Camera using IQ crome flash, option zoom is excellent. UB FOCUS for photoshop is good for dual cam.  Battery life is better. Notification light is impressive. 
Loudspeaker at the bottom sounds (single). 
Heating is average compared to branded.
 
Cons:
 
Front cam is not so good (doesn't matter) 
HIVE UI is so poor screen lock.. lags 
Flip cover & tempered glass not available in market. 
High game lags. 
Image gallery is not available (use quik pic app in play store for both img/video) 
Video gallery view is worst to search

 
Overall phone is good for this price. 
Need OTA update asap for better performance

I will write again after a week or two. Display: very crisp, elagant full HD display..great viewing angles, doesn't look pixelated from anywhere. Design: truly amazing design. Both gorilla glass looks amazing. However it is slippery from hands.u need to use it carefully till the tym u gt any covers.build quality is amazing..looks premium..don't use scratch card sent by xolo..it is of cheap quality and ur buttons won't work well after. Camera: I basically bought this phone because of camera. The picture are well saturated, colors are refined and picture looks good even after zooming a lil..but I think they could have made it lil brighter...u can do that with photo studio( it is an app for gallery too, there is no extra app for gallery) but how many times ppl gonna edit their pix. Front can is superb with flash which works fyn...the 2 MP can only works when u r using dual camera app...it gives great in-depth pix and good clarity after using with ubifocus..chormaflash is good, but cud have been better. Hive UI: phone lags sometimes..but it is very minute..some bugs are their but it doesn't effect the day today process. An app connect is der which updates us about the next xolo updates and what we gonna get..they will fix issues one by one..u need to have patience for that.. 
PS: hive was launched some months back..hence getting bugs is expected.
 
There is no heating issues.. M not a mobile gamer..but if u play small to middle end games. It works well..did not tried with high end game but I can work well too..
 
I was in a confusion too whether I should buy xolo black or lenovo k3 note or xiaomi mi4i...I made choice with this even after gttng not so good reviews on YouTube and here...but in the end..I will say...I made a good choice...kudos to the xolo team.;;;;;Thanks for your suggestion..pls don't remove ur post @absk;;;;;Go for J7, Its value for money in every aspect.

I just wanna know is it value for money. My email pavancoolz.pj@gmail.com;;;;;S i saw it but I require 4G must.. E7 does not support 4G..;;;;;Things you should know- # 2 MP camera isn't fake, it is used in the dual camera app and just for depth sensing and fast focus (although, it can't be said fast focus). It helps the 13 MP camera to capture the photos in more details. You can see the sample images in reviews, they're great. # HIVE Atlas actually lagging a lot! Its lock screen is the biggest issue for me. However, XOLO team has assured me it will be resolved in the first week of August. # It has Corning Gorilla Glass and it is great. The issue with touch sensitivity was also with me but it was due to the screen protector. I removed that and the touch sensitivity has improved, just like any other great phone. XOLO seems to be giving us cheap and useless screen guard. Just throw it, it is of no use. So, removing the screen protector will help you to have normal touch sensitivity. # You seems to have defective piece. I'm not using any cover and yet not faced any scratches.;;;;;Camera is not like 13 MP? Are you sure? I also have this phone and its camera is brilliant. It takes pictures like DSLR while we use Dual Camera app and even without it, it takes great photos. You might have got defective piece. Check it in any service center.;;;;;Hi all, I've confirmed the issues with XOLO team and as per them- -We'll get OTA update before August for smart flip cover features and few bug fixes. Also, we'll get free premium flip cover. :D -Android 5.1 update is scheduled for first week of August. With this, the lagging issues will be gone. Asphalt 8 will be running fine (although almost all the other games works perfect, including MC5 which my brother has confirmed). The lock screen lags will be solved too. By the way, the current lock screen actually sucks, it is damn slow. -_- I've changed it to stock Android Lollipop lock screen and it is working better.;;;;;I'm proud of being owner of XOLO BLACK. Excellent model. Met all my expectations.;;;;;@rahul Rathore :  Pls read the comments , GSM Arena is the best place where u can get genuine reviews , we have tried hands and we r now out of this game , as this phone really sucks ...

Its a No No. ...;;;;;wat abt headset,,,,& heating problem in this;;;;;Guys guys ,,,   This is a review after all my judgement . This phone is good only for those person's who have used a low variant phone earlier and a re now happy with the two or three animations and some camera features or UI or Looks .  If u agree , This phone is not at all suitable for the advanced level users as for different reasons , first is Lagging everytime in the phone , such as during calling , messaging , opening an closing any app . New unwanted or annoying apps , Not even there is a gallery specific , Everthing features or app requred are spread haywire .... Not even arranged , niether gallery , songs , vidieos , or calculator , compass , calendar .   On top of the cream is lagging .... Phone is 3200MH but battery 95% down to 25 % in 5 hours or approx .. This is a personal usage , of only internet 3g or some other app ,doesnt include any other games ... Camera  ,, everyone says good ,, My personal judgement not worthy , Example those who have  purchased the set , just try clicking photos from a ditance where u sit on ur PC might be1.5-2 Mtrs anything u can click either ur desktop or any written mail .  Then see the effect , its blur screen . Zooming only tears it apart but no clarity .....  .... Dual camera of no use just a publicity stunt , each picture about 20Mb not less than that .. Boos i dont have that time to edit in a photo studio and save the pics neither a Normal user my friends have .  This is a small example of effectiveness of the camera ... If users agree with my word then check...
 
Phone is good  on first look , awesum ....no words BUT ....................  Are we going to display it on the museum  . .. if anything is not of any friendly usage ....  
1> Todays generation dual sim , this xolo generation use hybrid sim , WTF .....carry ur sd card in purse , take out insert eject sim ,,,, Crazy or what ...... 
2> Lollipop effect gone by the crazy hive ui ...
 
If any of these words are wrong ... Please correct me ... I will remove the post .... 

;;;;;Amazing device with awesome camera features... Great VFM;;;;;How stupid you are! Its the same case with all the present generation smartphones and its not a defect! Please clarify your doubts among your friends and then post here.;;;;;I have receive defective handset.  I received the handset on 17.07.2015 and on 18.07.2015 evening I noticed the problem. the problem with this handset is after removing headphone from mobile , its speaker doesnt continue on its own. i have to reboot the handset every time i plugging the headphone. I tried each and every troubleshooting but problem is still the same. And This is why XOLO has not provided headphone with the handset. and on 19.07.2015 10:00AM i reported this to flipkart executive and since then I have talked 4 times with the flipkart executive and every time they told me to do one step of troubleshooting. So, I did completed all the circus what they told to me and still the problem is same. \ i had a good image of flipkart but i was wrong. dont get surprised if just like anyother market companies flipkart will send u soap insted of hanset. anything can happen with you.

Max tempt I encountered while playing RR3 was 39 degree C;;;;;The values are obtained from XOLO website and if they would habe provided wrong info than Indian Government might have banned this. Also, the SAR test is done by Government.

Thanks!;;;;;what abt camera.. frnt n back both;;;;;how is the hive UI ??? is it good ??? ;;;;;does phone gets heat up...&how is the operating system? ;;;;;Hi, Finally i got my xolo black yesterday, after a of using i am posting my reviews Look : The phone looks rich  and amazing with glossy back. it is like holding thick glass. Feel : The touch is smooth , initially i got problem with lock screen, after making a factory reset it works fine now. Performance : I have not tested in extreme condition, browsing, watching Full HD movies and hearing musics are fine, can see little bit Lag while scrolling or coming back. but can be acceptable. Display : Display is crisp and clean with rich color, but not as expected, because they advertised too much. Battery : backup is good, due to hungry processor, it may drain fast in extreme condition, for normal usage with voice, 3G browsing, and hearing music,watching movie for an hour, after 12 Hrs i had 35% balance. Play Store : I can install all apps fine, and they work normal. Heating Issue : if you are in place where the temperature is normally above 35 degree C, your phone will definitely get hot, if you roam mostly in sun it is better to have a headset. in A/C room and at night, its not getting heat. Audio Quality : I used with recommended Skull Candy Headset. I can hear great music with good bass. 
Call Quality : Mic and Speaker are good 
Ringtone : Yes you can set a MP3 file as ringtone.

Please confirm a few things like if xolo will be solving software issues from time to time via updates or not and if call quality is okay or not. To be honest, buyers are having hard time to place their faith on xolo. But this product is pretty awesome, at least when specs and price is concerned. So, knowing about xolo support and user experience will help a lot. We all know about the specs in pen and paper, no complaints regarding hardware. Only if xolo supports regular updates to optimise software performance, it would be great enough. Thanks in advance :) ;;;;;I have read some review in flipkart,  1) that while installing apps from play store getting some error is it true. 2) no gallery icon and gallery opening too slow. any xolo black user can give comments immediately, as i have planned to buy this phone;;;;;Hey watch xolo black video on YouTube by gogi rana it will clear your maximum doubts;;;;;11Gb is gud ...coz Lenovo k3 note has only 6 gb available 4 users out of 16 gb;;;;;does this phone supports all applications from playstore;;;;;I purchased from flipkart.

Hope it meet expectations....;;;;;is it better than lenovo k3 note in gaming;;;;;does this support quick charge;;;;;I ordered it yesterday.... the phone looks promising...  does the gsm arena team read our comments... if u do.. guys please review xolo black.;;;;;is this phone lags ;;;;;weight of xolo black;;;;;Noise Cancellation mic is at the top of the phone.;;;;;I've this device and can give you a little but good enough review. Screen Quality- Awesome. Not as good as compared to Mi 4i because Mi 4i have same resolution with smaller screen size. Slimness- Very slim and very comfortable to hold in hands. You won't believe it until you hold it. Camera- This is awesome, the best! It is better than Mi 4i. However, it is taking yellowish image with flash, however I fixed it by using White Balance. Informed XOLO team, maybe they'll fix it soon. Because it is too easy to fix it. :P Speaker- Great, superb! Build Quality- Solid. It has glass at the rear and the front and at the center, there is plastic frame but believe me, you'll not believe it is plastic. I was thinking it is metal frame because it feels like one.
 
HIVE- good. Not as good as other. It is almost stock Android with different launcher and a few different features. I couldn't found much great things over it. The worst part of this is its lock system. I tried so many different themes but the lock screen is too slow and it feels like it is too much lagging. I asked XOLO about it through mail and they're not ready to admit it.
 
Gaming- Great! Asphalt 8 was lagging in my experience (not just for me, almost everyone faced this), however, XOLO team has assured me that it will be fixed in August or near to end of July. There is no heating issue. Dead Trigger 2 was working great in it without any lag.;;;;;Sound quality is great and in the headphones which have XOLO especially worked on gives superior sound experience. I didn't tested Bluetooth Speaker.;;;;;The speaker is loud enough which can be expected from a smartphone and provides good enough sound experience. There are two speaker vents, however, the speaker is on the right side (front view) and the other vent have mic, I guess. However, most phones give just one speaker, so that is not a big issue!;;;;;There is no heating issue, as per all the reviews I've checked. XOLO is on the way to give a new OTA update and that will fix the lagging issue in Asphalt 8. Rest the games works without any issue in it.;;;;;This phone has noise cancelation mic on its front ;;;;;No other phone can beat this beast in its prise range its an awsomeeeeeeeeeeeeee phone this phone is totally stuffed with awsome features and it is far far far better than lenovo k3 note, xiaomi mi4i xolo black is the best phone;;;;;hey varun, is there any heating problem while playing a heavy games.;;;;;Hi i view review this mobile in youtube, but i thing everything is ok except camera.  Because is blue is background i saw youtube videos(5 videos).  Thats i ask xolo black user one question.  How is the camera quality pls tell me.  Advance thank friends.  ;;;;;please tell me how is the ringer volume? is it loud or average? is there two speaker or only one? hows call quality? please reply who have the phone and used.;;;;;Ok brother. Thank you so much.  ;;;;;Duo Camera is for re-focusing on objects after clicking a photo. The second camera at the back has 2 MP resolution and captures depth information, just like the camera setup on HTC One M8. In short, great little feature to have to give special effects to your photos.;;;;;Nope, its hybrid, you can use one at a time, either SIM2 or microSD.;;;;;Guys need your quick response for my ques.

Because I use phones for very much calling.;;;;;there is no Bluetooth connectivity  ;;;;;That Snapdragon 615(2nd gen) worries me;;;;;Thanks for the reply, well, does that mean, we cannot use both the sim together along with micro sd card?;;;;;cn any1 tell me abt its camera quality,and lags??;;;;;Xolo black more better .

It is better in service, its accessories are very cheap, It has full body gorilla glass 3 protected, Front camera with LED flash. It has more sensors. It has dual rear camera & processors of snapdragon qualcomm. These features make it to better  than Lenovo K3.

It will help to capture the photo quickly even slow moving objects. It helps to focus faster, in just 0.5 sec. Isn't it is great?;;;;;That's what I said!;;;;;For your information, it has too low SAR rating which means that it do not causes health issues.

Do read it's worth. The display is warm at low brightness but gets saturated at high level. Call clarity is the worst. No future updates for this planned as I have already quarreled with the xolo executives abt this issue. Battery backup is extremely bad. When charged to 100%, it loses 15-20% of its charge on standby. Camera is mediocre, though 8mp there's no autofocus. Don't record any memories on this phone, it will only hurt you when you watch it. Slo-mo videos suck. Xolo is not a promising brand, I recommend ul to spend a few more bucks and buy a good quality phone.  Thumbs down to xolo and their shitty innovation;;;;;battery drains very fast and at the time of charging it takes 3 to 4 hours and gets heated very fast  any recommendation while using the phone if any please tell...........;;;;;you are right brother;;;;;you are right brother;;;;;Any xolo mobile phone is not good battery very fast discharging mobile heating problem and also service police is not good customer care response is not good talk style not  good and service center executive not response customer what say;;;;;Wi fi Newark problem no chanted;;;;;One of the worst phone i have ever seen. The main problems are Battery draining very fast not lasting even 1:30-2:00 hours when wifi is on. Cheap plastic body. Camera is not good at low light. Heating at the time of gaming or internet browsing. Some system apps won't work properly. Last of all very very bad customer service at service center. So don't buy this phone  ( xolo era) In my opinion hike your budget little bit at grab another phone at 7000-8000  
There are many good phone in this range.

The smartphone packed with some average and some below average specification at its price.  The 5"" inch screen with 256K colors and FWVGA resolution is the worst choice any smartphone can even think.  The other con is it uses Spreadtrum 7731 chipset. MTK6572 is far better choice than spreadtrum. Look is good and for calling and browsing its average not the best one. Though you may face lags while browsing sites with heavy javascript. Anyway you can go with it if your priority is browsing social media or mainly calling.  kudos..,, ;);;;;;You need to check it first whether the camera support auto focus or not. In case you want to return your smartphone you have to go from hurdles of series of mails and phone calls.

Please do something xolo.;;;;;Plzz rply..i dont know what to do;;;;;when i activate the pocket dial and motion unlock the mobile goes off . does any one have the same problem ??;;;;;simply if more SAR value... its  harm full for human. ..... buy phone...  as sar value is low as much u can choose.;;;;;SAR VALUE ...... Each  GSM handset has a radio transmitter and receiver in order to operate in the wireless GSM network. That transceiver is manufactured so that when used next to the ear and when worn on the belt, it won't exceed the limits for exposure to radio frequency energy set by the authorities. The authorities in question here are the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of the U.S. Government, Industry Canada of the Canadian Government (IC), and the Council of the European Union. These limits are part of comprehensive guidelines that establish permitted levels of RF energy for the general population. The guidelines are based on standards that have been developed by independent scientific organizations through periodic and thorough evaluation of scientific studies.
 
The exposure standard for wireless devices employs a unit of measurement known as the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR. Unfortunately the limits set by the FCC/IC and the Concil of the European Union are measured over different amount of tissue so they are not directly comparable.
 
The SAR limit set by the FCC/IC is 1.6W/kg averaged over 1 gram of actual tissue. 
The SAR limit recommended by the Council of the European Union is 2.0W/kg averaged over 10 g of actual tissue. 
Although the SAR is determined at the highest certified power level, the actual SAR level of the device while operating can be well below the maximum value. This is because GSM phones are designed to operate at multiple power levels so as to use only the power required to reach the network. In general, the closer you are to a wireless base station antenna, the lower the power output of the device and vice versa.
 
As of 2010, we at GSMArena.com have added the officially set SAR values for most models in our database.
 
You will find we list several SAR values. The reason for that is the FCC/IC have stipulated that SAR should be measured at both hip level (making calls while carrying the phone at the waist) and at head level (making calls with the phone put next to ear). So you are almost certain to see two SAR values for the FCC/IC standard.
 
The Council of the European Union only requires the measurements at ear level so most manufacturers don't measure SAR at hip level for European models. So in this case you are almost certain to see a single SAR value only for the EU standard.

 
and it has 1.2W/kg      us 
while limit is 1.6W/kg.;;;;;can any1 tell me what is the SAR value??;;;;;Around 5 gb;;;;;No, it does not have notification led light.;;;;;today most brand are in market.  If u go to buy . U find many best phone under very less price. But no one care, look, know what the SAR value is. And of that phone. Its more important than look features.. First check SAR value than other things. SAR value should less as less . .and should less than 1.6 w/kg and not near to this. Its good if it is under 1.2w/kg. For more . . .u can search on internet. And be safe. . .and healthy.;;;;;what is the SAR value of this phone.?plz tell me if someone know. And Plz buy a phone ... not by features. .. first check SAR value. .

The claim of the brand XOLO which says crisp and clear picture of Xolo Prime is baseless and deceiving mobile users. Don't go on positive reviews of this mobile regarding camera. Its just a deception.;;;;;my 7 day expereance say its battery not gd and due to low temperature not connect charges;;;;;Camera is not responding;;;;;Any problem in this mobile please tell me right answer;;;;;Very good mobile. camera is brilliant but video quality decreases while playing. Same video looks more clear in other phones than Xolo prime.;;;;;I am using this phone From 3 months and this phone is excellent this phone is the best budget phone ;;;;;Awesome phone by xolo :-);;;;;very nice i am using 20days.there are no prblm and i am impressed with his looking.;;;;;Realllllllllly very nice phone I am  impressed by this phone this phone just rocksss!!!;;;;;I'm having problem with the LED Notification light...

So don't buy it.;;;;;xolo is the better phone. Camera is best 5mp hd camera 1gb ram 8gb rom. No hanging problme. Xolo is the best phone;;;;;press down button of volume key and press lock button both at the time;;;;;It is absolutely a better phone as compared to canvas spark because of its battery and back glass finish so if you love to play high end games like asphalt 7 without any disturbance of low battery it is a phone for that.Its camera and back glass finish pannel are also impressive . So if you are looking for a budget phone with good specifications,you should go for it.;;;;;This phone XOLO PRIME i have ordered from hs 18 And i will recive in this month only after 1 month;;;;;I am not satisfaction this mobile Xelo prime;;;;;I am using xelo prime mobile one use touch and speaker problems not response xelo executive  I am not satisfaction this mobile;;;;;Sim 1-normal size Sim2-micro;;;;;Every things' awesome but battery is very low.......;;;;;very good mobile  i using this mobile  ;;;;;i Purchase Xolo Prime Mobile It Frequently On _off and Battery also low And some time High Please Dont Purchase XOLO Mobile reputation is so Bad  ;;;;;Is this phone support dual gsm sim card both are mixrooo????;;;;;good  mobile;;;;;Press volume down key and power off key together and hold for 2-3 sec...for screenahot;;;;;how to take screenshot in xolo prime ???;;;;;When v r visiting service center,they says Xolo is very bad and heating one and nothing to do;;;;;Firt time xolo disappointed me.

I bought xolo prime from one of the Sangeetha Mobile outlet in Bangalore on June 2nd 2015. Phone suddenly stopped catching network signals on June 12th just 10 days post it was bought.Sangeetha Mobiles outlets customer associate requested us to not to reach out to them for all these problems and they suggested to go to service centers. We went to VR Info Service I'm Indiranagar first stage and we were told that there are many complaints with xolo prime and they did flash of the device and later it started working, but stopped within 10 minutes. We went to jayanagar service center and reported same and were told that they received same complaints on same day. It is painful to roam around service centers with inexperienced technicians. I recommend anyone not to buy this phone.;;;;;nice;;;;;Yes it is.;;;;;Is Battery removable...?;;;;;Anonymous you buy infocus M2 or xolo prime both are nic ..;;;;;its is a cool phn because of its battery back and its 5.0(Lollipop) Android version also it cheap in cost......Gud phn u should buy itttt.....i Have already Buy...... ...prime;;;;;Anybody please help me to select a best phone among these phones, canvas unite 3 ,infocus m2,xolo prime. Comments please ;;;;;go for canvas spark;;;;;If it had a better display resolution, i would go for it. Now i'm stuck between Infocus M2 and Xolo prime;;;;;It nice phone  and poor serivce;;;;;very good phone..;;;;;super so good....;;;;;then which is the better;;;;;noo;;;;;I  have  a xolo  smartphone A550 but it hang very  well  and it's  flash power is low  and itis  ram is also  low  but l think  this  phone  good;;;;;Guys please dont't buy XOLO mobile. i'm Not commenting about the performance of the phones. Their service is soo poor. if something happens to your phone it will take months to get it repaired. You can check this yourself by dialing their toll free customer support given in website. i'm sure it wont work. You can also check by sending an E-mail query to their customer support. You will not get any reply.  I found that most of their customer care centers are soo cheap like a road side shop with no good technicians.  Another thing is that you need pay in advance for your spare parts or else company wont sent the parts to the customer care centre. It is because XOLO service centers were not paying to the company after repair or buying spare parts . Now customers has to suffer. Even after advance payment, it will take months to get it repaired.  SO please dont buy these phones unless you back up all your data each and every time. I'm telling this because i have suffered for 2 months without my contacts and phone data. Thank you. ;;;;;Great phone;;;;;Down volume key+power key so u can take screenshot.;;;;;awsmm ph...col design..bt i cant undrstnd..how can i take snapshot in this ph?? anyone plz hlp..;;;;;how is itts front camera ?;;;;;how is its front camera ?;;;;;Cemera only 5mp is not good ;;;;;Xolo service is not poor I visited xolo service center my xolo mobile in call speaker is not working and I visited xolo service center and on next day they repared my phone now its working good so there service center is not poor its nice;;;;;Really very nice and premium phone by xolo and I am very happy that a brought this instead of canvas spark Both have similar features but by spending RS 600 more you get a glass finish on its back and its looks is far better than canvas spark and its build quality is very good its performance is also very smooth and in gaming its very good I play clash of clans in a day about 6 hrs then also its don't get hang I also have angry birds go and it also runs smooth and overall its a awesome phone;;;;;very vry vry vry pooooor service......pls don't purchase this compny mobile phonesss.......;;;;;ya its fine 1 from the xolo side ......but i wants more accept

interesting part is that its pack panel is made up of glass at this price point becoz of which it got killer looks now who cares about micromax canvas spark This phone is far better ;;;;;Everything is

For smoother video Unlock deploymnt and install moli player pro. For Youtube client ""mytube"" is best. For Best Camera clicks install oneshot camera app and you will save the HD pictures which will save in more than 4Mb in size, means you will get more than 13MP in its 8MP cam. Metro file manager is best in my opinion you can do anything in it like folder share mainly. For browsers dont go with 3rd party like UC and Surfy as IE is the best browser just set bing as default search engine and install turbo download manager for downloads. And for maps as similar to google maps like voice navigation, Install GPS voice navigation app which will directly link to Bing maps(default maps).

If both phones are windows phones the two mobiles must connect to the same wlan. The same situation happen with iPhone with share it. Don't scold xolo mobiles the only indian brand trying hard to satisfy customers.;;;;;windows xolo q1000 is best moblie i like it;;;;;I have been using this phone from last 6 months and believe me guys it was worth buying this phone. I'll share my review with you all. Pros- 1. Great battery backup, with average usage the battery last easily day long. 2. Decent front and rear camera quality, in proper lighting conditions it won't disappoint you at all. 3. The OS Windows phone 8.1 update 2 is pretty cool and fluid and there is nothing like you'll regret for being a windows phone user. 4. Great sound quality from headphones you get in the box. Speakers also produce decent sound. 5. Screen is quite sharp and colours are vibrant. As far viewing angles are considered literally you can try any inclination things are clearly visible then also. 6. No heating issues faced after hours of gaming. Tried games like asphalt 8, dungeon hunter 5, modern combat 5 etc. 7. Gaming performance is smooth. 6. Look and feel of the phone is a plus point. You'll find others staring at you phone literally believe me this happened to me a lot of times that people in metro and ar other public places ended up in asking about the phones because of its gorgeous looks(I have the white variant). 
Cons- 
1. I have faced some issues with playing hd videos but that can be sorted out by installing third party apps like Moli player. 
2. There is no option to zoom while taking pictures, its really disappointing. 
3. Lumia apps can't be installed unless you luckily finds it on store at certain time as I found Lumia camera only but in that too full features of the app won't work.
 
Questions- 
1. While playing games requiring multi touch my phone stops working, actually its the game only which gets stuck the phone never hangs but games seems not supporting multi touch on this phone. Please please help me to fix this issue. In game like angry birds stella the game screen got stuck while trying to zoom in and out, similar problem is faced with other multi touch games like modern combat 5, on screen controls in case of asphalt 8 etc.

Now this phone discharge at the rate of 10% per hour.When you buy this phone new the battery backup is good,but after few days the battery became worst.When you installed a game from store,it required more space (e.g.-Temple run 2 is 47mb but it requires 143.12 mb & subway surfers w.t. Kenya is 36mb after updating requires 121.36 mb), so your phone memory is quickly full.It's internal memory is 7.3GB,but it quickly full & if you want to install the app from phone to memory card,the system writes 'First delete all app 'so what is benefits/ gain. &#2404; If first download a video,you cannot play it the phone writes  file error:802.....something.

After buying this phone I am really impressed with its performance. I am a game lover and like to click photos.And this has done all the jobs very well. Then I looked at its reviews many people complaining about its battery and camera but anyone who is willing to buy this phone let me tell you guys the ones who are complaining about it are just talking rubbish. Let me tell con's and pros of this s phone for your help: PROS first: 1) great camera(really good clarity and color quality) 2) gaming experience is superb (even very high graphics games work like charm like Asphalt 8 and Modern Combat) 3) no heat up problem even when charging or playing game. 4) no hanging problems as 1.4 GHz octa core processor does a pretty job 5) battery backup is pretty good can last two days with moderate usage CONS: Well I didn't find any con's but some people may think that 1GB ram is not sufficient but let me tell all of you guys that even after updating all apps Andy installing other ones the ram in use never rises above 600MB. So 1 GB is also good in case of ram.
 
Thanks and regards (if you are confused in buying this or not I would suggest you to buy it).;;;;;Does it phone otg supported,??;;;;;Sensor light no xolo omega 5.5 ;;;;;I used omega 5.5 more than one month. It was really nice phone. Display,battery, sound quality,camera are pretty good.;;;;;I'Ve planned to buy a phone. Which mobile phone is better Xolo Q2500 or Omega 5.5 ?;;;;;I decide to buy this mobile. Does it support OTG??;;;;;I always believe on XOLO & its products. I had XOLO q1010i which was awesome. Unfortunately I lost it. Therefore I booked Xolo OMEGA 5.5. I had referred the same to few of my friends. Now they are happy with my suggestion. I Got Omega 5.5 yesterday. Earlier i had read bad reviews like some people commenting that sound is not good, camera is poor, battery backup is poor etc. Just shut up. XOLO OMEGA 5.5 is EXCELLENT. Sound when heard on earphone that is provided in box will give good result. i used NOKIA earphone & checked. That didn't work. But when i checked with XOLO provided earphones, it was amazing. perfect sound & effects. felt like i'm listening original sound & high class theatre quality sound. thats really very good. It is better than even SONY..!! Camera.. No words about it. XOLO mobile cameras are always good & little more good on SONY lense cameras in q1010i & HIVE divices. Battery: Yesterday when i got the phone it was 60% charged. I charged again for 1 hour & it was 90% by 5pm (14-5-2015). Used thoroughly & now the time is 11am (15-5-2015). The battery charge remains at 70%. So, battery backup is also excellent. Thank you XOLO (fb: www.facebook.com/MyXolo);;;;;I have purchased Xolo omega 5.5 one month ago.

I bought another Xolo mobile recently Play 8x1020. 1020 model has 5Mp front cam with flash + 8 Mp rare + notification light, mobile itself is quite light comparing to Omega 5.5, And offcourse less bugs due to stock android. Has compass sensor as well and almost 1 k cheaper if bought on deals. So I think for girls Play 8x 1020 model is much better, also white model be very good looking.;;;;;by feature best mobile;;;;;I want to buy this mobile. Is this mobile bulky to handle or not ? ? ;;;;;friends what is the  prize of omega 5.5;;;;;i am getting a doubt?how come this many felicities  in less price...right now i want to know...;;;;;Bought Xolo Omega 5.5 on ebay for 8.2k, Now can get for 8k with 10% coupon. Frist the CONs - 1. Photos (skin tone only) are little yellowish in default setting, but has lot of details and are better then any other phone cam I have seen under 15k. May be a different cam app or their OTA update will fix that. 2. Front has 2mp which is good for video calling, but not for selfie at all(though may be ok enough in outdoors with sunlight). For selfi the voice capture work beautifully with main camera. As per Xolo we will get gesture control as well in future. 3. No gyroscope sensor(has accelerometer)   meaning Some apps related to direction etc will not work. 4. No notificatoin light
 
Now Pros -
 
1. GPS locks within 40 secs..
 
2. Photos are very very good in outdoors from primary camera. Just to little bit of yellowish skin tone(though good for dark people :)). Or else you can reduce the saturation and it works ok.
 
3. Display screen is good for 5.5 inch 720p screen, and comes very close to MI note screen. cant really tell which is better.
 
4. Octa core proccy is good enough for most of the high end games out there even with only 1 GB RAM palyed DearHunder HD/real racing 3.
 
5. Flip cover and scratch guards are in the box. The quality of flip cover is very good(doesnt make your phone thicker on the back side) both of these item are worth 4-500 bucks in the market. can expect the flip cover to last 1.5 year easily. 
 
6. One sim slot is Normal and other is Micro, 3g can be set for either sim slot, but will work on only sim at a time.
 
7. Battery life is quite good, even with 3g always on and their power app disabled you can get 2 days of backup if uses are only calling 1 hrs per day/occasional internet use/30-40 mins of gaming/whatsapps etc.
 
8. OTG is supported out of box/ Proximity sensor was not working of box, but when I installed one proximity app from google store, it started working automatically. So may be I had to calibrate the sensor first. 
 
Another option will be newly launched Xolo Opus 3 for the people who don't want to play very high end games, not bothered with non removable battery, but it has 5MP front cam for selfi and almost 800/- cheaper then this model.;;;;;Nice improved design which happens to be something different.Faster browsing speed & gud picture quality.The flip case provided is smooth & appealing.Appreciate XOLO for taking their continious efforts in refinement of every product.;;;;;Why ;;;;;sound quality and signal strength is so poor..;;;;;i m using this phone..camera, touch is better..sound quality is poor..no hanging..no heating...one thing is noteable that don't beleive at battry talktime and standby hours..its fake..in my opinion micromax is the best..bcoz i had used..canvas a96.. now i m feeling sorry for sellig that..;;;;;xolo mobiles are not good product for uses bcoz it's use one year after it will dead . you don't buy .;;;;;When update lollipop for xolo omega 5.5 any ideas.;;;;;Hi guys, can any one knows whether we can update to lollipop OS.

10.charging time for device from 15% to 100% is 2hr45min 
11.dont send your mobile to service center for small problems as you knw it will tak weeks to months to rectify jst rectify them with telecalling xolo 
12.some features are need to be upgraded in the upcoming upgrade..but overall its the best device for this budget

I was very much satisfied with that. But unfortunately I lost it.Then I decided to go for xolo omega 5. I expected much from this octa core mobile. But I feel disappointed. I am facing all sorts of problems that could arise from a mobile. Heating problem while charging or playing games, poor battery back up,poor camera,very slow and lagging, poor widgets from hive ui,frequent crashing of apps,no lollipop update from hive team, etc. I wonder if hive ui development company still remains. I am a patriotic Indian and will buy only Indian products. But I feel ashamed about xolo Indian company.;;;;;Very slow touch response and camera quality is poorest I have ever seen.;;;;;Hi all, have been a user of this phone since Feb 2015 and after 6 months of usage, I feel I have quite a good gadget in hand after Nokia 5130 Xpressmusic. Purchased it on an online shopping website. Xolo, of course is Indian make and there were questions in my mind for the brand as well as this product Omega 5.0 (and 5.5) and very less reviews whether to own it. But NO REGRETS!! I'm satisfied and would recommend my friends to purchase for something within a nominal Indian middle-class budget. You will surely have a nice exprience using this phone. I faced no problem till date either with its battery or with the touch or display. The Camera hind and front both work upto my satisfactory levels. Very good quality hearing while on call; no interruptions or disturbances. Playing music openly is so-so, loudspeaker listeners would not much appreciate the sound. Earphone modulation is excellent. My phone hanged twice 3 months ago, but that was due to my overloading of applications. Definitely unnecessary applications eat up your phone space giving a li'l to Random Access. Now no such complaints. Have not tested big gaming applications(such as Asphalt) on this device so do not know much on its influence. If someone asks me, I give a thumbs-up for buying this phone;;;;;It will support in l update;;;;;Mobile update;;;;;charger gets heated while charging n many apps n software gets crashed too many times have to submit n very bad battery back up ;;;;;very difficult to operate this phone. idle time is very less and often phone shut down automatically which is not required.;;;;;very bad phone and camara is very bad don't buy this phone;;;;;i want to know is omega 5.0 support pen drive (flash Drive) directly? ;;;;;i got battery complaint..after 2 months.....;;;;;no proper gallery cant create album their ! sad becuase cant move photos so !! other than that evrything good and last one secondary camera i slow 2mp an ful zoom.;;;;;it wil get in mid of august;;;;;mobile gets heated while charging...;;;;;the battery backup of this phone is so poor;;;;;is battery backup of this cell is good or not;;;;;poor battery backup;;;;;I want to buy xolo omega5.0,plz tell me whats problame the phone is?;;;;;Which is best between xolo omega 5.0 and xolo one?;;;;;Yes temp.

Now this review will explain the performance of Xolo Q710S. My Personal Usage statistics/day: Call - 2hrs, Message - 20, 3G/Wifi - 2-4hrs, Games - 1hr, Other apps - 30mins-1hr. Battery: It lasts for 2-3days for normal usage and 1-1.5days for heavy usage. Battery drains only if internet is connected all the time. Standby is more than 3 days which is really good. Touch: It is smooth and responds pretty good. Hang/Heating: Never faced such issues till now. Camera: Primary is good and secondary is average. 8GB Memory: 6GB available in which 2GB is for internal apps, I haven't utilized much of the memory hence this is fine for me. Gaming: I have tried only couple of games like Moto racing, Sniper and the performance was good and no lagging. Others: Ram 1GB, so speed is good. 4.5inch display, so handy. Dual sim (Both normal sim), so convenient. Speaker is in the backside still has good ring volume. Good call clarity, automatically reduces outside noise from ur side. Certified as radiation free, so safe. Xolo secure available inbuilt for theft security. Android Kitkat, so latest software and can be upgraded to lollypop once available.
 
Overall: If your usage is similar to that of mine, you can very well buy this phone and that too for a price range of 6-6.5K in India.

About its look, its good. Its very slim and has good configuration. 4.5Inch display with 1GM ram and 8GM memory with 2000mAh battery for Rs 6200 is a real good deal. 8GB memory does have only 4GM available for you where around 2GB is used for existing applications.

It is quadcore 1.3 Ghz mt6582 chipset  2. Its back is not leather ! Its plastic but its has a leather like texture 3. If you are YouTube watcher , game enthusiast, battery life is not good for you even in the specs it is mentioned 5 hrs of video playback so consider buying a battery backup with this phone. 4. This phone is my daily driver it gets heated up when you play heavy games like asphalt, FIFA,etc but if you use light games it does not heat up and performance is very impressive at this price (I bought @5299) 5. For normal use this phone is fantastic, memory app storage, everything is in perfect quantity. 6. I recommend all the Xolo One costumer, not to update to lollipop or updated, downgrade because there are way more issues in the lollipop update and some main features are missing from Google's lollipop version.

Only difference is OS. I am using Q610s for one month. Its battery back up is pathetic . If you need min 1.5 days battery backup don't go for Xolo One or Q610s model (only 1700 Mah).

Also if you install DU battery app, we can see the battery percentage drop. ie from 30% to 0% it will go within 15 to 20 min (this is user experience of Q610s).

Unique combination of features in the mobile are.. 1. IPS LCD HD display 720 x 1280 pixels (~267 ppi pixel density) 2. Damage Resistant Corning Glass 3 3. Battery 2800 mAh 4. Latest Andrioid Kitkat 4.4 5. LPDDR3 RAM (fastest RAM in this range) 6. Clock speed 500 Mhz 7. OTG Supported 
apart from that fingure print scanner, Infrared application(smart remote) etc. 
I am sure you will not get this combination any mobile in this range.
 
I know other specifications combination are just an average but these are most buying in the market. 
1. Mediatek 1.3 GHz quad core 
2. 1 GB Ram 
3. 8 GB ROM 
3. Primary 8M and secondary 2M Camera 
and so on.

Slowly falling for it..  Earlier thought its huge in size..now it feels like ideal size..esp more so for elderly...now my old 4.5"" looks midget Update has been provided of about 14.4 mb ( supposed to correct maps crashing ; i havent updated n my maps are not crashing ) New n good for me     - double tap to open offscreen ;     -from lockscreen u can go directly to certain apps eg camera/call/sms (u hv to change lockscreen via settings for this feature ) ;      - a small widget contains certain apps n also locks screen directly ( so no need to press power button to lock screen ). 
    - comes with cover, charger, ear phones , extra ear phone covers
 
Changes i dont like - well they are related to android kitkat n not to phone per se ( like sd card is not detected now when u connect phone to laptop ; settings have changed )

Battery drains fast when we play games (especially online games) 3. Back cover or Cases, nowhere to be found..... 4. Sometimes phone did not gets charged if we plug it in wallcharger, but it shows the charger sign. 5.

Accessories... screen guard is available online, but back cases are hard to find even online... i am now using transparent case of other brand phone.  Apart from that the phone is excellent given me no complaints for the past 1-1/2 years....Only sore area is battery which drains fast but you can always use a power bank for back up.;;;;;Spare battery is available. If you need please contact the authorized service center. I bought it few days back. There is no problem with battery as such but I bought it just to keep it in stock or future. i am happy with the phone. The best part is it's Camera. It has Sony XMoR sensor which helps in taking Pro photographs. I myself has clicked wild life photographs through this phone which came out to be best. The only issue with this phone is there is no software update. It is still running on Android Kit Kat version.;;;;;Though the phone is good but the biggest problem is that once your back cover or smart flip cover goes old you will be left with no choice but to sell your phone as these unethical people will ask you to go and search in local market. I tried to talk with so called xolo care, mailed them various times but they have only one answer that they do not sell the accessories. why the hell any other company will make back cover or flip cover for your phone. So even the phone is good but don't go for xolo phones else you will be cheated by these unethical business house. I asked them to replace the phone but they are not ready for that too.;;;;;Back cover not available in market.;;;;;never ever go for xolo phones, worst phones, worst customer care executives, not service centers, no android updates nothing good about company;;;;;dimerits : . warm (ie , radiation) .mic prblm .ic problm advc: dnt buy . . . ;;;;;this company thief company. service center bogas . not a buy one mobile xolo;;;;;My husband buyed xolo-8x-1100 before 11 months.. in 2-3 months there started so many problems in phone related to mic, camera...it is very worst phone. why we buyed this phont?

Xolo should look into this!!;;;;;Can you specify your booting problems.. I believe m facing the same problem... ;;;;;Not buy xolo phone. Bad things:- 1) back camera doesn't work properly in night.  2) battery back up is very very very very poor. 3)buy at least 2800mah phones. Good things:- 1) Speed 2) Touch 3) headphones;;;;;I bought this phone at last xmas eve, somehow ran for one year. But Man know this!! ...right after 2 months I bought xolo play 8x 1100, the microphone was damaged.I sent it to  xolo repair which took me complete 30 days with the warranty card. But the moment i got my phone back i realizd my rear camera focus was damaged again and my snapshot button after some days following. Today its running dragging itself somehow for one year but ask me??...the battry partly damaged! The screen goes out every 60 sec!!..,biggest thing it made me quiet mad!!...I should have listen to my friends and my family. Don't ever buy this phone plz..:( :(;;;;;agree.. i m using since 1.5 yrs.. no issue.. but bad experience with spares  and service..;;;;;XOLO is not even worth of reviewing, worst worst worst phone ever and company's customer care personal are just pathetic.;;;;;Third class service centre.otherwise phone is best in its range.;;;;;Most of reviews are true because its work very bad and spare were not available in market and almost service center not support to issue  spares;;;;;Xolo 8x 1100 is average . Working 10 months very good but from 3 month vioce not clearly hear to others . Once micropjone replaced but not satisfy.;;;;;its just worst mobile & company. never buy the product of XOLO. service is also worst........... i buy mobile before 11 month, but i only use it only for 2 or 3 months. remaining month it was used only by XOLO service center. DN'T BUY THIS COMPANY PRODUCT.;;;;;Most useless phone, it had no assignment with Google so Xolo secure do not work, Purchased on 31st October , battery worked and was able to charge full only once, visited Service Center for replacement they refused, new battery could not be charged more than 56% in more than 5 hours, received battery back today that is 13rth November 2015 which was given for replacement on 6th November 2015. The battery etc. are not awailable in market. Never never never buy this company products.;;;;;Guys please don't buy any product of xolo brand because they are utilising very bad quality material which can definitely give the problem and along with this its costumer care service is not only worse but great worse  You will definitely face the certain problems like Battery backup, mic problem, touch problem, battery swallenvand non avalibilty of parts ;;;;;iam from dehradun. Pls never buy xolo phone. The co is cheater after sell no body respond your problem. ;;;;;Nice phone, I m using this phone since last one year, no lag, no hang. But no software update till now. Otherwise this is a good phone. ;;;;;Battery &spares not available ;;;;;      A complete trust-able review from user using ""XOLO PLAY 8X 1100""  from 2 years.! This phone is awesome .Have been using this phone from about 1.5 years . The Battery is not at it's peak in it's first 1 month , but yes, after sometime it become stable . It gives a battery output of about 5 hours for 4 hours of charging.In standby mode it gives 10 hours of approx. full battery power . Camera quality is not so good on a 13 mp! I was glad to know that other phones with 8 mp quality was giving much much better quality. speakers are good . I recommend buying heaphones - Philips SHL3095WT/94 DJ Style Headphone With Mic- White ( link for buying -http://www.ebay.in/itm/151848542889?aff_source=­Sok-Goog)  as it's a best with this phones at a price of Rs. 1,300.It feels like this heaphone was made for this phone only. Now we come to lagging issues .please if you heard from anyone that this phone lags, it's false .It has completely smooth processing with 2gb RAM;although there are some little heating problems not basically a problem .It starts heating a little when played games like ""ASPHALT 8 -AIRBORNE"", ""MODERN COMBAT"",which is a problem with every smartphones in this range. Screen display is quite impressive & it gives a professional -like feel when placed in hands. 
A 5-inch display as you already know has a 1080 p video play-back which is a good feature for viewing HD movies and playing HD games .
 
Headphones which comes with it are also good  , but you should definitely buy the ones which I mentioned earlier for great movie experience .

 
Front camera is great as compared to rear camera with a 8 MP .So it's good for video-calling and skype .
 
Inbuilt speakers are also good but it has a low volume but okay when a call is received .So you will be able to hear your calls LOL :).
 
""1 GREAT FLAW WITH XOLO COMPANY IS IT'S SRVICE""
 
It has a very bad bad bad .,or say a worse service - rendering .So don't expect to get a HD screen replacement after broken . It will take months and months for your phone's service. 
(when in warranty period)
 
inside the box- a charger, a cable (USB) , headphones,OTG -cable(a rare feature in this price range) and a Flip cover (also a great feature in this price range).
 
""Overall a rich user-experiencing smartphone"" at a price range of Rs,13000.

 
any recommendation- ""yes, you should definitely buy this great android smartphone.""
 
Any rumours- ""yes , some people say that the 2014 version is made in china & comes with ASAHI glass . Let me tell you people that ASAHI glass IS THE BEST WHICH IS NOW COMPETING WITH GORILLA GLASS 3.and yes it has been manufactured in china , but no problem they are still providing the same performance as the white -coloured model ;whose manufacturing has now been stopped in INDIA.""

Bad experience with XOLO;;;;;I like to buy this phone , what is or option rly plzzz quickly;;;;;Which year update phone in lollipop;;;;;My mic also stopped function..  17 days it took for service..  And after one month again it has stopped..  ;;;;;Worst customer care experience. my phones mic went dead in 2 months. given to service center on 6th may. haven't received device yet. no reply from them too. In black model way too cheap parts of very bad quality are used...no more xolo after this. very bad company...;;;;;very bad customer support - ordered battery from 30 days but not received yet;;;;;I bought this phone for 14k. Average android performance. NOt upto mark of 1.7ghz 2 gb ram. Camera quality is good but lot of blur in pics. Audio jack get spoil soon, Headset given were of good quality. Battery performance is poor. Flipcase is awesome.Features of special guestures were cool. This phone would b worth quoted its prise as 10k. Xolo say its powerful octa core. Xolo fooled al its customers. Very poor hardware configuration , Call does not connect. Iam using black variant of Xolo 8x 1100. Iam big fan of xolo. BUt not now. Earlier I used q1200.;;;;;handset is good, bt i facing mic issue on my handset, xolo 8x-1100 black , i give it to service center on 2-may bt still no reply from service center, plz dont by black handset. ;;;;;very bad customer support - ordered battery from 20 days but not received yet;;;;;i have been using xolo play 8x for last six months.. according to me and my experience it seems to be a very good phn and economical regarding to the provided specifications and evrything is working well.the phone will give you an amazing gaming experience. but a problem occured for my mic due to external heat when i kept it in my bikes dash and it had been successfully serviced by xolo care. the only problem of the phn is the it cant manage heat well;;;;;i have been using xolo play 8x 1100 for 6 months... the phone is very much economica with respect to the provided specifications and every thing is working very nicely and the set is awesome for gaming.. it supports any type of games and i hadn't experienced any decreased capacity of the battery.. but a complaint for mic had occured due to external heat when i kept it in my bikes das and it had been successfullu serviced by xolo care within 10 days.. the obly problem of the set is that it can't manage heat properly.. everything other exceptional.. and some part depends upon buyers luck ..;;;;;Hello.. Friends :D I Just Got Free Recharge Of Rs 1000 ;;;;;worst experience with xolo play 8x 1100 and 8x 1200. customer care service is sooo disappointing. plus not a single accessorie is available for xolo phones is super bonus. bad experience with xolo play 8x 1100 black model. ;;;;;My Xolo - model Play 8X-1100, has been submitted for the third time for the same complaint of unusual heating of the handset on date 04.04.2015. ( work order no. 310001268031 ) Major problem of Motherboard replacement was carried out earlier & still the same problem of heating of handset is repeated. During this repairs following more problems are noticed, 1. Battery life has reduced considerable, which earlier showed more than 10 hours talk time has come down to 4 hours or so. ( 60% erosion in capacity due to battery heating with faulty circuit ) 2. Display Screen size has reduced 3. Speaker volume has considerably reduced. 4. Wi-Fi connection drops and I have to make it ON again & again. 5. Screen touch response has slowed down and many times a character/alphabet next to the desired one appears on the text screen. The said handset was purchase on 14.09.2014 and is in warranty period.
 
Considering above repeated problems I request the Xolo management to provide me a Brand New piece and end my agony of sending the handset for repairs again & again.
 
But Xolo is adamant and not responding to mails and request of replacing faulty handset are ignored. Just trying to repair and send back faulty product to customer is their moto.
 
PRASAD KARNIK, Mumbai;;;;;How come u not facing battery problem ,plz tell me ?;;;;;never buy xolo phones friends. i am also waiting for xolo play 8x-1100 battery. registered 3 weeks ago. not got any call from them to collect the battery till date. i myself called two times to service centre as well as customer care, but no positive response. They cant help even if they want. the company is absolutely incapable of providing after sale services, which you will definitely be requiring after the purchase. my phones battery got swollen just after the expiry of 6 month warranty period. so i registered to purchase the battery for rs. 788 three weeks ago. but i am feeling helpless as i cant use my phone and they are not providing the battery. so never buy the xolo phones if you really care about your money.   ;;;;;Super cheater co.

Asahi using phones are googles nexus..  This glas helped the screen to work in all arientation of phone along with scratch resistence.  With gorilaglass it was unable to respond by the phones screen when it is in flat surface.. .  No lags at all. All the android games are playeble without lags.  Awsome performance.  Very happy with xolo :) ;;;;;Continued.... As there is no edit facility, The original review stands corrected & additional relevant info as below. 3) Audio Quality It is very difficult to say audio quality accurately without combined Lab test & experienced audiophile subjective opinion. However the following is my subjective opinion based on reference Sennheiser earphone & confidence on my ears.  Xolo claims wolfson audio codec DAC used but Audio quality is poor, as low frequency band is  filtered / deteriorated  & high frequency is excess loud. Hence it is neither audiophile nor even qualify to be HiFi. Wolfson audio codec chip set is being used by Samsung in their some premium models with specific Model IDs e.g Samsung Galaxy Model S4, Model ID I9500 (Not all phones of same model have this chip set e.g. S4, I9505 uses Snapdragon). The sound quality of Nokia E52 appears to be far superior. The sound of Moto G (1st Gen) is also better than Xolo. Built-in audio player is OK. however if you have already purchased the phone, you may consider  PowerAmp App (Rs 58) & set the equalizer to flat, except 32Hz to +50%, 64Hz to +30% , 125 Hz to 15% to compensate poor bass(but not pure). Further at Phone settings>Audio profile>un-select sound enhancements (both BesAudEnh & BesLoudness).

 
Addnl Info
 
13) screen Front glass: it is given as scratch resistant Asahi glass at Infibeam specs,  but  it is specified as Gorilla 3 on the packing received along with phone.
 
14)  Build quality is OK functionally, but poor comparatively. especially flip cover makes creaking sound even for light pressure.
 
All other concerns & info given at different times on Xolo  8X-1100 stands true to the best of my knowledge & opinion.

Good News -Battery Drain In my phone (50% of total consumption) was done by ""media server"" as identified by App GSam  Battery Monitor Pro. As I have installed microSD card  from old phone, it consists of tons of files on it , media server was always scanning. Soln: Disable media server through App ""Media Scan Switch v1.0"" but it needs rooting Results: Not only battery drain by Media server is eliminated , but also total battery consumption reduced dramatically (i.e.it was also loading hardware/cpu etc) e.g. consuming only 25-30% with moderate use ( will it come for 2 to 4 days?), definitely expecting more than 1 day .  -KitKat brings a limitation, it makes Ext SDCard useless But XOLO overcomes this with innovative way by swapping phone memory with external SD Card at boot image level i.e. for all programs , Ext SD card appears as SDCard0. However the limitation shifts to Phonememory. 
Soln: this can be solved through ""SDFix V0.7"" but it needs root again.Result: Phonememory (mounted as SDCard1) also becomes writable. 

 
Phone Manufacturer should do sufficient R&D before bringing into market, even though Google is making improvements / Beatifications & changing versions so fast without maturity,  but also bringing limitations / controls like these ""No ext SDCard, No Void.ftab, No init.d , bulid prop limits etc"", unfortunately KitKat does not allow even GSam Battery Monitor Pro to function properly , it also needs root. But Upto JellyBean 4.1.1, it was flexible;;;;;excellent performance. Worst battery. If you are planning to buy this phone consider investing in a powerbank as performance of this battery is highly poor. With internet on 7 hours. Without internet 18 hours. In short this phone will cost you 13500/- + 2500 for a good powerbank total will be 16000. On other hand i can buy asus zenphone 6 at 17000/- with same specificatiom whose battery lasts 12 hours with internet on & 2 days without internet. Im mentioning asus because my bro is using it and we have practically compared battery lives of each device..;;;;;....continued. Minor Concerns: 1) Little bit more (area) touch is required (even after removal of [packing] screen protection film) 2) Relatively high battery consumption. 3) 2GB RAM is OK but DDR2 4) Xolo service centers may not be abundant like Samsung.;;;;; 1) Call Quality Clarity is excellent, Signal catching is excellent, loudness is Good. 2) Camera Quality Both Rear & front cameras are excellent comparatively. Further they   excel in low light conditions also, again thanks to Xolo for using Sony Exmor RS type rear sensor (the sensor itself costs approx Rs 2000.00) & front BSI CMOS. However there is scope for improvement in color faithfulness. 3) Audio Quality Built in audio player is poor in fidelityc, PowerAmp (Rs 58) is  excellent almost audiophile quality of music. It may be due to wolfson  audio codec DAC (model is not specified by Xolo). This the chip set   used by Samsung in their some premium models with specific Model IDs (Not all phones of same model have this chip set). Thanks to Xolo.
 
4) Video quality 
Video play quality is ok
 
5) Sensors Quality 
All sensors are working OK, magneto meter integration with Goggle maps Is seamless, far sensor is optical resulting quick response to off / on the screen.
 
6) Battery Consumption 
Battery consumption appears to bit higher side compared to Moto G  (quad core) or Lenovo 369i for similar use. for example 2 hrs 2G talk, 10MB data use, 20 sms from morning 8 am to night 10 PM, it consumed around 35%. No heating issues under normal use. (Gaming is not tested, purchased based quality specifications)
 
7) OS experience, Features. 
Kitkat 4.2.2, almost it looks like stock, but the dialer / people is little bit confusing. Inview of this,  I am using 3rd party app ""Dialer One"" for dialing & ""Pansi / Easy SMS"" in inbox / out box mode for messaging. Gestures works flawless (when screen is off only) but consumes high battery for keeping  touch 
system always on. So I kept it off.
 
8) Size of Phone 
141.5 mm is little bit high but now a days, 5"" screen is most popular.In fact 4.5 to 4.7 inch screen overall length 130 mm (like Moto X/G 1st Gen) is handier & fits well in shirt pocket. Weight is OK.
 
9) Appearance 
Nothing special but good
 
10) Goodies 
Flip cover & screen guard is included in the package. It is a good strategy, as they are not popular outside.
 
11) Quality of accessories 
Quality of earphones supplied is above average but bass is limited,Data cable is OK, OTG is cable is excellent. 

 
12) Info for Advanced users  
(The info below is associated with risks of bricking the phone if not used properly and warranty may void etc. so it is at your own risk) 
 
1) Stock ROM is available for flashing in case of extreme conditions. 
2) Rooting tools /methods are available for administrative privileges. 
3) Boot loader is not locked. 
4) User Replaceable Battery (very useful during unbricking etc)
 
Reliability is under observation. Excellent phone, imported by Xolo as a manufacturer, so Indian brand. Highly appreciable for bringing such a quality product. It can compete with Rs 30k+ phones. It is pity for such an excellent phone, no reviews by experts are available.

Dont worry n go for it.;;;;;Is it worth to buy this phone or think about the other?;;;;;Nov,2014 Ashashi,glass ;;;;; Never buy xolo play 8x 1100 black colour 2014 nov model. I charge my phone 4 times a day.Battery charge to 100% within half an hour or  within 15 minutes and discharging time is also same (30 minutes or 15 minutes. Phone automatically switched off at 30% battery. May be it is battery issue.Secondly its rear video quality ,body quality , battery power is not better than huawei honor holly.so tomorrow (12 jan 2015) i will go to service centre for battery issue.Snapdeal has delivered this fault  set on 3 jan 2015.There is no smart gesture,no gorilla glass 3 in black colour nov 2014 model set. But asahi sratch resistant glass is present in black colour nov 2014 model set. Corning gorilla glass 3,smart gesture is present in aug 2014 model black white colour set. Why xolo company did not display  specifications of black colour nov 2014 model set in their website?. 
Company show only black white colour aug 2014 model in their website. 
This full black colour nov 2014 model set is manufactured by lava xolo company only. 
So in below reviews people said it is the copy of play 8x 1100, 
that is wrong.Huawei honor holly is much better than this  set in terms of money 7000Rs only, 
most important build quality and camera video quality is excellent.I recomend you go for honor holly.;;;;;Never buy xolo play 8x1100 black colour 2014 model .go for honor holly.;;;;;  USING SMART GESTURE IN XOLO Play 8X-1100 {(the smartphone was in must screen lock was slide)( please to go settings > security press > screen lock press> choose  slide option)} you can use smart gesture please follow .  first you can click settings  >click smart gesture> click to tap> or click to drag when on it become blue> to see down option> first draw unset (click to drag it become blue)press draw unset(before click to on)it become see a list of app own your smart phone. to select which app your favorable or which app you should easy to open please to select THEN you  close all. please single  click power off button the display turn off then you can USE SMART GESTURE (use draw unset 2th item please see the drowning pattern under to top drown across the display) Then open that choose application.  ;;;;;  USING SMART GESTURE IN XOLO Play 8X-1100 {(the smartphone was in must screen lock was slide)( please to go settings > security press > screen lock press> choose  slide option)} you can use smart gesture please follow .  first you can click settings  >click smart gesture> click to tap> or click to drag when on it become blue> to see down option> first draw unset (click to drag it become blue)press draw unset(before click to on)it become see a list of app own your smart phone. to select which app your favorable or which app you should easy to open please to select THEN you  close all. please single  click power off button the display turn off then you can USE SMART GESTURE (use draw unset 2th item please see the drowning pattern under to top drown across the display) Then open that choose application.  ;;;;;pls dont buy xolo mobiles.i purchased xolo 8x 1100 mobile on 13th dec.my mobile was hanged & dead on 22nd dec.xolo is cheap brand .i took it to service center .they are not well equiped to do major services.they sent it to factory at noida.it almost 20 days bt still i dint get my mobile.;;;;;Friends I want u all to be safe. I will give this mobile 1.5/5 (only because of camera and gaming) I purchased XOLO PLAY 8X-1100 ""Black"" on 31 December 2014. There is no Gorilla Glass 3 protection and smart gestures as promised by the company. The mobile is full of glitches and bugs. It also have sounds delay(like in phone lock and volume up and down) which is referred to as a soo called ""feature"" by the XOLO care. I think no company provides sounds delay as a ""feature"". They just dont know how to get this problem fixed so they are just avoiding to repair it. Yesterday, I had visited the Xolo care as my handfree was not working but it was working in the other mobiles. They told me that I have to leave the mobile for 10-15 days as they will have to send the mobile to change its PCB. WHAT KIND OF MOBILES IS THE COMPANY SELLING??? DEFECTIVE!! I DIDNT EVEN USE THE MOBILE SINCE I HAVE PURCHASE IT RATHER M BUSY RUNNING TO THE SERVICE CENTER EVERY NOW AND THEN.

I don't know if this device work properly or not.But I do believe. some people says that the device feels hot when running big game but without any big issue.I think it might be because of octacore(single silicon having 8 processors).T he 8 cores might not be able to transfer the heat released while running heavy games.

This phone have 2gb ram, 8 processors, 1 mali 450 graphics card, 2 camera sensors, 4 normal sensors and 2 special sensors. light weight. candy design and coring gorilla glass with 294ppi display gives amazing touch experience.  Android kitkat 4.4.2 Excellent configuration. Light weight and soft touch. Extraordinary front and rear camera quality. uninteruppted 3G video play back. Worth for money. Amazing performance.

But it is released only in 2014 August , not even 6 months;;;;;Hi, Even i too facing the same problem. I am using the phone from one year, now suddenly one day - the touch screen at one place is not working. ;;;;;Guys.. This phone is really good till it works fine.. battery backup is good, and if you are using wifi all the time, anyphone will run out of juice quickly. My phone lasts for 1 day easily on about 4 hours of talking and around 1 hour on 3g internet, 2 hours music and around 45-60 minutes games like asphalt 8, fifa etc. I think it is more than sufficient.  Processing power and apps/games functioning is superb. Also before playing any game, make sure you uncheck the CPU Power saving mode in battery option to have best use of its processing powers. Call recordings apps are working absolutely fine, 32 gb card, very well working with the option to move apps and games to external memory. Problems faced: The speakers do have less power as the output is low.  Touch is a bit letdown as it is slow and not very sensitive. One extremely annoying thing is that the shortcuts placed on home screen dissappear automatically and specially after connecting it with computer and restarting it. This is extremely frustrating and i hope it is fixed in future updates. Also it do have some signal problem as when both sims are active, suddenly one sim will losses it's signal, even though the same network sim card in other phone will give you full signal at same place. This happens almost daily. The negatives seems to be the software glitches which might be resolved in future updates. 
If you weigh the positives with negatives, it will appear to be a good choice. Rest is upto individuals preferences and tastes.;;;;;Battery will never be there in a new unopened box phone. It means that the seller had already opened the box and used it for some purpose. To make flip cover work, u need to click Leather pattern in display settings.

I have deposited the mobile with the local service centre people for repairing at that time they told by evening it will be ready after repair but they could not repair it and told me to come day after tomorrow, on that day also they could not set right the problem and they informed me that they have to send the mobile to their main service centre at Noida.  What does it mean, either it is having some manufacturing defect or having major technical problem. Till today the issued is not resolved. In Baroda local service centre itself, every day, average more than 50 comaplaints are registered regarding faulty xolo mobiles purchased by customers.  That is what I have given my review that this quality of Xolo product is very poor.  Further In the box of the bobile they have given the features as 13 MP rear cam but in the Xolo Quick Start guide supplied alongwith mobile indicate 8 MP rear camera.  Because of this I have to approach consumer forum for misguiding and cheating me.

Seeing the latest release Xolo One gives the impression that it's made by scraping the barrel for tricking the fans of Android One. The specs of XOLO One are so bad compared to the other brands of this price range. Their Facebook and Twitter pages are active all the time to advertise their phones but you get automatic response like answer or will be ignored if you have a query or complaint.

With normal use the battery will last one day. 3.) The white flip cover is standard issue with the phone and soils easily. Replacement covers in other colours are not available in the market. 4.) The Octa core processor is very FAST...!!!.  I am not a serious gamer. I am sure gamers will find this very useful. 5.) The phone is light and is a delight to use. 6.) The  ear /audio seems a bit muted and the built in speakers are inadequate to play music. 7. The Plug in Charger has a very short cord and is of poor quality.

I have purchased Xolo 8X 1100 on 7.9.2014, within one month it got technical problem and same was not able to repair at their local Service Centre Baroda.  As such I requested for replacement of the defective mobile by fresh one as the defect has taken place within one month period.  But the company straight away rejected my request and they said that it not under their company's norms to make replace or refund.  After lot of email with Xolo Company and registering complaint with Grahak Surksha Samity, now they are planning to replace the same.

I am using this phone for the past one month. Saying frankly it is an awesome phone with amazing features. Camera quality is comparable with that of higher end phones in the price range of 25 to 30 thousand. The only let down is the 2100 may battery which drains quickly with WiFi browsing and heavy gaming. Its better to get one yourself and write an honest review rather than making nonsense statments based on second hand information;;;;;360 Security;;;;;Go for online shopping..;;;;;Hello friends, I m not any agent or any seller A real user so just trust me I m using this phone from last 2-3 weeks which I ordered from eBay  I would suggest u to go for it Good features: 1.

Indian brand, as being the MODI follower I prefer u to go for Xolo 8X 1100 or any other phone. 4. It have gorilla glass 3 & it is really a strong one 5. All games can be played on it without any lag 
Bad features 
1. Battery sucks, like I use to chat & listen to music, as after 4 hours of chatting or listening to music I found my battery near 45-50% which I don't like atol 
2. Touch is not so good, it is good if u r using it through ur thumps 
3. Back camera not so good as compared to Asus zenfone 5 & moto X
 
This were the points I have found it  
Still I will prefer u should go for it  
Overall the phone is very good 
It's looks impress the others as well as the premium cover they r offering

Ty :);;;;;Just bought this phone 14 days before...am really happy with this phone...camera...apps...no lag..battery drains a lot while on data connection... Other than it feels like a iPhone in hand....go for it guys....literally superb...;;;;;was planning to buy 8x 1100 bt is 8x 1100 more suitable for games...... for normal use...for a girl...... 8x 1000 is better or 8x 1100 ..???;;;;;in gyroscope u can play hd games with motion hand sake function;;;;;Hello Freinds can anyone tell me which antivirus to be installed on it Please answer ASAP;;;;;Gyro gives u full six axis motion includin accelerometer's three motions, which enhances ur gaming experiences, 3d modelling n many more. ;;;;;Wat is the use of gyroscope?? Plz tell;;;;;Wat is the use of gyroscope?? Plz tell;;;;;Its been 3 weeks since I started using Xolo 8X 1100. I must say, this phone has impressed me with its specs, performance and features. I have moderate use of the phone - about 2-3 hours of phone, data usage all day, screen on almost 4 - hours. The battery lasts a whole day. Extremely smart power-saving features that makes your battery stretch atleast 30%, maybe more. Wifi, Data connections working like magic! The display is also very impressive. The camera quality is great. The processor is designed for a gaming experience. I don't play games much, but, this has made the phone highly responsive for business apps. like emails, messaging, data, etc. The speaker output is also quite loud. I did read somewhere that the phone heats up, but my experience has not been so. CONS: The speakers get muffled considerably when the phone is placed on a flat surface. Ringtone volume comes down drastically due to this. The touch screen is not too sensitive and requires a bit of pressure to operate.
 
All in all...great phone for this price !!;;;;;I am intrested in this phone ;;;;;In which website did they announce that xolo 8x 1100 will be officially Available ?Plz give the link ;;;;;see micromax nitro is good phone but it doesnt comes with gyroscope and even magnetometer sensors.then it is your choice to buy which mobile?;;;;;download download manager from play store;;;;;This is one of the best phones under 15k. Guys do not compare it with a PC, this is a phone. I am owning it from 1 month now and find only a very few flaws. This phone is very gud in multitasking, playing games and internet browsing. 1. Phone heats up a bit but i guess that if Xolo comes out with a better body like a metal bezel it would reduce this problem. 2. Battery power could be increased upto 2500-2600 mah. However that will increase the weight. 3. Accessories are not available in market - Screenguards, backcovers etc. If that is done Xolo could attract more customers (even females - looking into the current light weight the model has). This model has everything in it. The only change required is a sturdy body. The existing body looks premium and good but is very delicate. SO XOLO GUYS IF YOU ARE LISTENING BEING AN INDIAN I SAY U HAV IT FOR A LONG TIME IF U QUICKLY LOOK INTO THE FEEDBACK SERIOUSLY.;;;;;put gravity box reduce the brightness. also  frezz hall lock, and xolo apps , battery charge will reduce normally;;;;;Thnx for reply. And i can't download videos and  pics from whatsapp. Plz help;;;;;You need to turn off an app named XOLO POWER. It turns off and on the data connection and wifi to save ur battery.

It had lots of features to count but very cheap quality materials used.  This made the phone so bad.  It looks good, features are so many..but performance is extremely poor.  ;;;;;Why this phn is not available at any mobile store ... i want to puchase it..;;;;;same kind of duplicate phones available bcz of phone popularity.. seriously guyz its a awesome phone, u cannot be cheated by using this phone, its worth.. realy trust me.. go for original xolo phone... xolo play 8x 1100 rocksssssss.....;;;;;Worst phone.  It woks good for hardly a week.  Cheap quality material used.  Touch is so bad.so bad is the camera and audio....bad phone..company should not seel this product;;;;;Hi, I am using this phone for last two weeks. And i am facing problem that data connection and wifi  automatically turns  on and off .And also i am unable to download pics and videos from whatsapp. Anyone who also face this problem plz help. And those who have updated their phone plz tell that does the update fix these problems? ;;;;;Awsm phone, camra quality is very gud :D i m vry satisfied with the XOLO service.. Go 4 it without doubt... :);;;;;After using this phone for the last one week...i have following review Design It's sleek, light & gives elegant looks. The back side has matte finish and does not leave residue at all. Plastic quality is good. Smart flip cover which comes with this phone is of premium quality. Rocker & power button should have been chrome or mettalic, i feel sometimes they are unable to press the switch properly. The only thing..which xolo should look into is accessories. back cover & screen guard are not available as of now. Features Phones has features which are available in above 25k phones in the market e.g hotknot, smartgesture, dts etc.Screen size is decent 720p gives a good resolution even in sunlight. Screen can be displayed from extreme angles clearly. Dual speakers has good sound output. Performance I am a heavy user of 3g, uses around 3-5gb every month. have not noticed any lag while opening the heavy pages,videos, e-com apps etc. camera performance is pretty good because of sony sensor (which captures the focus pretty fast), flash light is too bright sometimes. Phones does not heat up while working on internet, however little bit of warm during charging. 
Extra: xolo (being an indian company) provided the bunch of premium accessories with this phone. no other phone company could have given. Also, in my recent experience regarding the service xolo is doing pretty well since i have service one of my phone xolo 700s recently, which was given within 10 days by service center. ;;;;;Canvas Nitro vs 8X-1100 Xolo Play 8X-1100 and Canvas Nitro have a lot of things in common and this small review will give you a good idea about what you can expect from these devices. # Similarities between Canvas Nitro and Play 8X-1100 Both Canvas Nitro and 8X-1100 has the same octacore chipset (MT6592w) and same amount of Ram (2GB) .The rear camera is made of a 13MP Sony Sensor which performs quite well. Both have a 5inch 720P IPS screen on the front with good viewing angles. Overall performance of these devices are almost identical. Its fast. # Now lets talk about some differences between these octacore devices. 8X-1100 gives you 16GB internal storage + a micro sdcard slot. It also supports OTG which allows you to plugin pendrives using an OTG Cable (priovided in the box). On the other hand Canvas Nitro only has 8GB internal storage. It does come with an sdcard slot,but strangely doesn't have OTG support. One other main difference is the battery- Canvas Nitro comes on top here as it packs a 2500mAh battery compared to a smaller 2100mAh one on the 8X-1100. Play 8X-1100 comes with a lot more sensors (Gyroscope,Magnetometer,Accelerometer,Ambient light sensor,Proximity sensor,Hall Effect sensor) than Canvas Nitro (Gravity , Light, Proximity Sensor). One other big advantage 8x1100 has over Nitro is that it comes with Gorilla Glass 3 protection.
 
If you compare the overall look of the device, Xolo 8x-1100 comes on the top as it comes with an attractive black and white combination. You don't get a leather back though,like you get on Canvas Nitro.But u do get a premium flip cover with xolo 8x-1100...
 
Even though both have the same Sony Sensor at the back, the front camera is different. Canvas Nitro has a 75 degree wide angle BSI sensor, while 8X1100 comes with an 88 degree wide angle 5MP BSI camera.
 
8X1100 has DTS on board with Dual speakers which is always a nice thing to have. Nitro doesn't come with dual speakers or DTS on board.
 
# Software 
Micromax has made a lot of software additions to the stock Android Kitkat, like a blinkfeed like news app on the home screen,some cool gestures and widgets etc. Xolo 8X-1100 on the other hand comes with a close to stock Android experience. The flipcase provided in the box has some cool features. Note that Xolo's Hive UI is not available for this device and there is no official word from them yet whether this will get a HIVEInside update.
 
# Cons 
Nitro - No OTG Support and only 8GB Internal Memory. 
8x1100 - Smaller Battery, 2100mAh. 
Neither Micromax Nor Xolo is promising Android L update.
 
# Verdict 
Overall both are good devices to own. If you prefer better battery backup, i would suggest to get Canvas Nitro. If you prefer more features like a Gorilla glass,better looks,more internal memory,more sensors,DTS and OTG support, 8X-1100 is far better device to own;;;;;Please someone explain about playzone app and its features. Doest it have preinstalled games. Hows the front and rear camera. Please  help. Thanks in advance;;;;;Currently out of stock in kerala . 1 doubt is that  Why arent they advertising. Please someone explain about playzone thanks  looking forward to buy this phone.;;;;;Thanks we can use skull candy headsets ?and iam cnfused btween micromax nitro or this one plz tell which is best;;;;;The music quality on the provided headphones are not bad,but cannot be compared to sony or any other branded ones.since the phone has DTS,surround and equalizer the output is pretty reasonable and does the job.;;;;;'Preferred Install location' is another option which is available there for apps. So the option which i told you earlier will only affect the default write disk in case of cmaera, backup, downloads etc.;;;;;does anyone know why is the price of this phn is increased so much ??;;;;;but will it not change the default save location for all apps? I want to change for camera only.;;;;;check out ebay, amazon and snapdeal. Such is the demand of this phone that it is selling for more than 15000. on ebay it is selling at 20000. so please dont talk rubbish.;;;;;Go to Settings, in Device section choose Storage, there change the default write disk to 'Phone Storage'.;;;;;Hi! i m confused xolo 8x1100 n moto g . plyz better then;;;;;why r u repeating your previous comments again & again.. and claiming this phone as worst... u seem to be a brand ambassador of any other competitor of xolo who is only here to degrade the brand of xolo huh?  ;;;;;Hmmmm... After reading your comments am really thinking what could have made you write so bad about this phone.. Tell me one just one feature which is bad(hope you know the meaning,average is not considered as bad) on this phone.. I really don't find any flaws except less battery(that too adjustable) on this phone... I read/assume it in this way, when some phone is not available in market ""it means its in demand"" Think before you write anything here.. All the comments at gsmarena are very important and checked by all.. People will not believe when said something good but believe blindly when said bad without investigating..
 
So guys looking for this phone can ignore her comments..
 
This phone rocks with it's beautiful features. 
;;;;;If you read opinion, you find this phone the best.  But the actual phone is just reverse. If this phone had been that good, the company would have tried to sell this product during Dhanteras at least..but it seems they have stopped this phone due to some major manufacturing defect.  This phone is neither available with retailers, distributors or even online...;;;;;Yes..worst phone....we got three phones in our group and we all are unhappy....Company has stopped selling this phone may be bcos of this reason only.   This phone is no where available, not selling at all..just review and opinions doesn't make a phone good..;;;;;How is the music quality in earphones;;;;;How is the music quality in earphones;;;;;Buy xolo..nitro doesn't have otg and it has very weird back cover.. Mi3has only single sim so it is not in this comparison.;;;;;7 out of 10 Display and camera.. Full marks For operations..touch is not as good as the other devices, some time network issue happened,no gestures are working. Otherwise very good to use this device, I m plying real racing3 1.5gb game but no hanging or freezing,not much heating. Very light weight n slim. Battery 10hours in normal use with 3g. U may feel less options in settings and operations. So in this price range of 12 to 14k good mobile to buy.;;;;;can anyone tell me how to change the default save location of camera of this phone? when i didnt insert memory card the pictures used to save on internal memory. when i inserted memory card the location changed   to memory card. I want to change it to internal memory. Can anyone help? I checked camera's settings and there is no option to change save location.;;;;;i have this phone, everything is awesome with it!!! really chanceless!! just download a battery pro saving app and get a powerbank!! everything is awesome!! the phone is awesome enough to handle your everyday task!! it handles everything like ease!! get it man!! its better than mi3!!you can ask me anything regarding the phone!! i am not interested in rooting the phone!!! so dont ask about that!! ;;;;;which is better xolo 8x 1100,canvas nitro or Mi3. ;;;;;which is better MOTOROLA MOTO G OR XOLO PLAY 8x-1100...plse reply soon..! i am really get confused with both...!;;;;;its a awesome phone ..... screen is very smooth and camera is mindblowing.. wooo ;;;;;7 out of 10 overall. I bought this on 27th sep14,but facing some issue like screen is not rotating, touch is not working well and network was coming and going.. So mobile store replaced my piece with new 1 after 2days. But having issue of touch and network is as it is..another problem of gesture, it is not working at all! So I visited service center of xolo..I explained them everything, they told me yes this model has issue of touch and network, but u will receive software updates for these issue. And for gesture, in this model gestures is not started yet..but u will receive software updates for these also in short time.that's the answer they give!;;;;;i have been using xolo play for a week now, resolution is superb, camera is also good, i got no problems with touch, but the battery goes down fast other than that this phone is awesome. im glad that an Indian company can do this good.;;;;;DOES any1 know when this phn will come back in stock ?? others sites other than infibeam like flipkart & snapdeal or in local stores.;;;;;Its Screen is a big Let down. Touch is not very responsive, I had removed my screen guard,, but then also its not smooth at all. BUT the worst part is it has a YELLOW TINGE i.e. the white color on screen is yellowish because of which it looks very dull... Has anyone else has noticed this yellow effect?? If not then open any app with white background like google play store in this phone and then in some other phone, you can see this difference which is very large...;;;;;I think he got defective piece. XOLO Play 8X-1100 has best camera in this price range and also best speaker and sound experience in headphones in this range. The display is also great, and now XOLO's service is getting better and better. :);;;;;Nitro do not have many of the features that this phone have, especially Corning Gorilla Glass and Hot-Knot so how can they keep it under the price of Nitro? And about Canvas Knight, you should read the model carefully- that is Knight Cameo, which could not even be compared with Nitro. So, better purchase XOLO Play 8X-1100.;;;;;Hay ! Gyz....  i'm little bit confused...  i want to buy a xolo mobile  ...  which one will be the good one? Xolo 8x-1100  or xolo q3000??;;;;;Your statement 'superior features than nitro' ... Really???  Can you please recheck,  compare both phones again and check?? At least I feel , pricing of this phone is accurate and acceptable with the kind of phone it is. Awesome;;;;;Why are you worrying about that when the people who are already using this phone are giving great feedback about this phone under comments in gsmarena. But yeah , still the rating is not decreased that much. For complete 2 months, the ratings were at high 8 which was really great.;;;;;To be very frank, in terms of battery there is no difference at all. Both lack in battery but performance and other features wise,xolo wins over moto 2nd gen.;;;;;R u sure,,!!,,,,100%""""""????;;;;;supb phone and i love it;;;;;XOLO is doing stupid with pricing of this phone. XOLO has launched this phone against MMX Nitro. Now Nitro is costing less than 11,000 and 8x 1100 is costing at 13059 at Infibeam. Why? Moreover, MMX Canvas Knight, which has superior features than XOLO 8X 1100, is now costing at 13399 at Infibeam. Then why now anyone will go for this phone? Xolo you need to be proactive in this highly competitive world.;;;;;why are the ratings of this phn gone so much down on gsm arena ??;;;;;Worst Phone at this price.  Worst display. Very cheap quality display, worst rear camera...bad sound quality, poor brand...  Only one reason to buy,its an indian brand...buy and promote indina product, end Chinese monopoly;;;;;Which one has better battery backup  XOLO Play 8X-1100 or moto g (2nd gen)? ;;;;;Superb in all .... Camera, screen,  touch, battery, audio quality,  performance,  oh its too too too superb .... ;;;;;Hey I have but its touch is superb, so 1ce u check ur screen guard;;;;;11gb something... But cell performance is too good;;;;;I agree with you on all the points you have mentioned. Very honest opinion. Very true that touch is not so good. If your phone on table you can not type with any other finger. You should use thumb only. Not sure the similar problem exist in any other phone.;;;;;4GB plus is available for apps installation.;;;;;Battery is bit of concern. Apart from that everything is really good. UI is basic android KK. But you can install custom launcher for better UI. I have installed Doodle launcher and it works really great. Also it never slowed down and not consuming much battery. ;;;;;Around 14GB is available. ;;;;;Am using xolo play 8x-1100 post 4 days. it is one of the awesome phones in India you can go for it. except battery backup all are really good from an Indian company. Hope all Indian brands will suck the other foreign brands.  Good luck. Thanks in Advance ESS;;;;;Hi, I would like to know about the UI design, i.e whether the phone look is good?

I have lot of expectations for this mobile as seen Specs, reviews & videos. But i lost my full expectations when i saw the Display of mobile. Made of cheapest display materials. No crispiness, No sharpness, Feels like blured when you look at the home page or icon page.  Even the touch responsivness was so boring. There is no point in ppi. Because when i saw the same ppi mobile Zenfone 5, The display is so beautiful. You can feel(zenfone 5) the same quality, crispness, sharpness as you see in premium phones. But this was so bad for xolo. Lastly i went to buy Zenfone 5.  NB: Never Buy this mobile Online just seeing spec. Go 4 shops where they have opened box of this xolo. see it if you like it go & buy from online. Else you will loss your expectations & money. Some will think i am saying this because i hate xolo. I have no problem. but you are loosing if you buy.  Pros: They provide you more features with less cost, this is done buy reducing quality. Even the shop guy told me, gionee(gud quality - but more price) is better than xolo & micromax.;;;;;Hall effect sensor detects the near by magnetic field, n thats how the smart flipcover works which hav a magnetic lining on it.

Its a very nice phone and it also has Hall Efect Sensor ... I wanted to know how to use this sensor...please Advise.;;;;;it really shots amazing photographs with good quality even in low light the sony Exmor sensor do its job nicely..... ;;;;;WELL If u want to but the phone under 10k then the redmi 1s is better phone but u get only 1gb of ram of which u get only about 600mb usable or may be less due to miui otherwise phone is very good.  but if ur budget is upto 13-15k then can go for moto g2 or xolo but if u are a gaming freak then dont care for the battery and go for xolo as has above 30k antutu  score otherwise is also a good option but the screen quality of new moto g is not as good as the old one. both moto g and xolo have 294ppi screen xolo has much better camera than the moto g2 battery almost same but moto g2 is little bit on better side as the processor is less powerful as i'm a gaming freak i'll always prefer powerful processorwhich xolo is providing at an affordable price and also xolo 8x 1100 looks nice in hands(as xolo seriously woking on designs too) not better than customized back cover of moto g2 but still a good value for money;;;;;Thanks Buddy.;;;;;Please anyone tell me about camera quality of XOLO PLAY 8X-1100.  Is it really like sony Xmore sensor ? (I want to buy it) Hope some one replies ;;;;;As you have used all the phones which one you suggest is better from redmi 1s,moto g2,xolo 8x1100?;;;;;i have been using this phone for a week now pros display  both cams r good especially front cam superb for selfies looks like a premium phone quite loud both speaker and earpiece good call quality due to noice cancellation flipcover is of premium quality lot of space to download apps processor is amazingly fast everythng works superb on this device 
cons:- 
battery is a definite thumbs down, discharges very fast like not even a day with moderate usage;;;;;well friends i bought this phone a week ago and i purchased this phone after using redmi 1s and moto g(2)  the phone is awesome for gaming everything u throe at it will run like a breeze.games i played on it (asphalt 8, modern combat, dead trigger 2) they all run smoothly.   i use this phone over wifi the downloading speed is awesome, websites load very fast  touch experience is very good, very less beezels so quite handy also , look is also great sometimes confused people with htc one. battery backup is good not great. xolo power support app. provides good support to push the battery to run throughout the day very easily with little bi gaming (15-20 mins with high graphic games), lots of watsapp with frequent on and off of data, watching videos for 15 mins ,calling 1 hr with awesome call quality with all this the battery will still remain 15-20% at the end of the day. earphones supplied are a bit average but speaker quality is decent with dual speaker. apart from this i experiance 2 shutdowns during call that might be because of some laucher error(using nova launcher) but apart from this every thing is butter smooth from excellent screen quality to gaming.

If yes what does this update has ?;;;;;what about net speed?;;;;;I got my phone couple of weeks back and using since then. I would say this is a very good phone with this price range.  It has very good display and nice outer look as well. The black and white combination looks really nice and unique.  I need to mention about the flip cover which comes along with the phone. It is just wonderful and perfectly fits in and the sensor works fine. I did not see any lag playing games or using the apps. All the time I see 600-950 MB RAM free with heavy usage.  Camera is damn good. It takes very good pictures. Both front and rear. Battery is not bad but it lasts 16-24 hours with normal usage like 3G+calls+bit of gaming. If you do continuous gaming, it will last only about 7 hours. It has gesture feature where you can draw something and assign it to any app. It is really cool and unique. I have not seen this thing in any other phones. Just received an software update from XOLO. Overall I would rate this product 9/10 for the specifications it has at this price range. 
Go ahead and buy !

Does the front camera have a flash of its own? or not?;;;;;Sam, since you have been using the phone for a while, I had a few queries for you. I will be GREATLY obliged if you would be so kind as to respond to the queries at your earliest convenience!  A. Do the Full-HD recordings appear to be shaky or jittery in any manner? In one review about another device someone claimed that activating electronic image stabilisation while recording a video can result in shakier or scratchier recording. Is that applicable in case of `XOLO 8X-1100`? (I hope not.) B. How good is the performance of both the cameras in ""low light"" conditions?  C. While recording video with the rear camera, does it record the audio in MONO or STEREO?  As in, is the recorded audio track ""monophonic"" or ""stereophonic""? The latter uses two microphones while recording and gives a sense of directionality and audible perspective while WEARING HEADPHONES. Thanks in advance.

Demerits 
Poor battery backup( Battery suddenly drains when connects to 3G network) 
Even without internet the battery getting discharged for videos and games 
Phone getting heat in top of touch screen and its backside while playing games and long time usage.

Its worth money..m using dis fone since last 2 weeks and I wasn't able to find any cons except the battery backup.xolo plz luk after it..otherwise go fr this fone..;;;;;It is a disaster phone. From 3rd day It hangs and in 10 days it completely shut down. This is review of the phone but worst comes next.  The service center told they need 20 days to repair it. When in 20 days I didn't receive my phone, I sent lots of mail to the xolo service care with invoices, workorder order and their number. but each time iIreceive same mail with query date in subject line. ""Thank you for making us aware with your grievance. This is in reference to your email dated 03.11.2014 regarding your complaint for your XOLO Smartphone. We request you to kindly share the work order number(310000+) so that we may able to provide resolution further. While the work order number was available in mail."" 
No ticket number!! nothing!! so that I can refer it in next mail.
 
Finally i got the cell phone after 52 days.
 
Phone is a disaster while the service center is the icing on the cake.;;;;;Use the ""APUS"" theme in your Xolo Q610s and it gives a good battery packup.;;;;;i am about it for buying plz tell me frnds. is  support pdf file or not?;;;;;My Opinion for xolo q610s is that 2 improve the battery back up, as it is not at all good, on the other hand phone is excellent , i have no complains regarding to the apps,resolution camera etc.. Lookwise also phone is good, it has BEEN given leathery finish which looks classy while holding in hand.. at last i would like to suggest the company to improve the battery of XOLO Q610S... as it is only 1700 mah where that of XOLO Q600S has 2000 mah...;;;;;Dear All I am using Xolo Q610S model Smartphone for a past one week, I am very happy for this phone in this best price, but I agree some demerits about battery backup, I updated some merits and demerits of this model Merits  &#61558;	Phone looks good  &#61558;	Nice touch screen, nice resolution &#61558;	Good dimension, thickness 9.3 mm ( so slim),  &#61558;	Best price  &#61558;	We can install the apps in SD card ( for Moto  E installing in internal only) &#61558;	Good Rear camera 5Mpx with LED flash and HD recording, Front 0.3 Mpx (VGA only) &#61558;	Mobile pack comes with screen guard, back case and require apps ( we need not to install like FB, quick office, file manager, gallery, videos and browser) Demerits 
&#61558;	Poor battery backup 
&#61558;	Even without internet the battery getting discharged for videos and games 
&#61558;	It battery range is 1700mhr only, so it will manage only 8 -10 hours  
&#61558;	Phone getting heat in backside while playing games and long time usage.;;;;;Is it support otg;;;;;this is a good phone..  perfect  but battery prblm;;;;;I m using dis phone frm last 1mnth.  Gud phone at dis cost range. DEMIRTS:- Battery backup is really surprising g..its nt at all gud. Phone starts heating from back side wen charged. No flipcover..not available online or at stores. Over all a gud phone agn went to an average region ;;;;;Phone is good....I will say it is excellent in its range..! I brought it for 62000 and I don't think I have wasted my money. Camera is good. Resolution is good. 218 PPI camera recordings. Luks wys its superb. For battery backup its not up to date but still it runs for full one day when using 2g ntwrk. People complaining about battery backup are stupid . If that want a fone for larger battery backup..that should buy fonea of battery rating above 1700 mAh It has only one problem that it does not supports 1080p videos.
 
From my side...its a gud fone and I m using it from 3 months..and it is best smart fone in its range.;;;;;Yes 100% true. Battery drain very fast. Stand by only 6 to 7 hours, even mobile in not use. I am using this last three days. I waste my earned money.

XOLO,Play 8X-1200,";;;;;this phone is awsome ;;;;;i am using this phone for 1 year, it's working fantastic. in gaming also, serves good, sometimes in heavy gaming ,it heats up but no issue for me.  The only disadvange is it is having kitkat version, and no update from xolo till now. recently rooted my phone with kingroot, and performance is improved that surprised me. ;;;;;This phone is heat b cause this is a mettal body N when u a charge this phone u dont use this phone  I promise do not complain agin 4 heat I love this phone his camera is very good n only one problem wife network clearly not searching ;;;;;I m using this phone last 7 month .this phone camera is good.

N while watching mvi battery will be low after finishing single mvi after full charge. Wifi doesnt catch signals properly. N too much heating issue even after lowering cpu performance in setting.;;;;;M not agree with this review. Gaming performance is good but mobile heat like a hot French fry. U cant bear it on yr face or ear  while some one calls u while u r playing game or while charging. Graphics r good bur wi fi device is very poor. Same goes with battery need to charge 2 to 3 times per day. N dont expect for any update, company policies are only focused on selling.;;;;;Dont go gor xolo, i hate this cell, using this cell for last 1months. I hate this cell. Nothing good abt hardware n software look like Chinese phone.;;;;;What a phone !!! Woow . excellent !

Every day I facing different kind of issue.. Last I had used xolo q800, that's really good. That's why I goto this company. But am really disappointed. My kind advice when you plan to buy this mobile then please choose other option. Its really not worth on our price..  Camera only advantage on this mobile..;;;;;Same problem ;;;;;I have recieved a software update buh as soon as i open it ,, the app stops;;;;;software update is unfortunately stop;;;;;Bought xolo 8x1200 after a lot of research in Aug2014.Its touch started giving troubles very soon.You enter one thing through keys and it displays other,selecting pics from the lower side of gallery became a task,similarly while selecting refresh option on whatsapp it opened some thing else.Its soft keys became dead may 2015,i.e.in just9 months after purchase.I had to deposit it at a shabby service centre,which has sent it to noida for the change of touch,which will take 15-20 days,Sic,Now i am without a smart phone.I am repenting my decision of buying this phone. ;;;;;just restart the mobile probably it fixes;;;;;please do not buy the phone heating effect is a lot and battery packup is worst that i have everseen front cam is good rather than back.;;;;;auto rotation is not working in my phone. is there anything I must do to enable it?;;;;;please dont buy this phone cause tej is buying IT;;;;;Anyone is receiving any updates??? 5.0 or anything??;;;;;Can Support OTG and works Good.;;;;;Still there is no updates on this device i think!;;;;;You received System Updates ?? I have Android 4.4.2 kernel 3.4.67 and it says No Updates.;;;;;I received a update but that was error I can't understand what going in my phone;;;;;Good phone;;;;;this is menufactured by chines company ;;;;;Bad phone don't purchased it. Batrery & heating broblem are big...... Only 5 mins of used using  30% battery down....;;;;;Anyone is receiving any updates??? 5.0 or anything??;;;;;Me too having three colour LED.;;;;;i am using this phone for 3 months now,excellent product from xolo,everything works alright, i appreciate what xolo as a brand is able to produce on daily basis. listing below the highlights pros 1.good built and feel to the device. 2.good front cam and completely acceptable 13mp rear cam.
 
3.good for gaming and daily multitasking with an octacore clocked at 2ghz with 2gb memory.
 
4.good amount of storage capacity as internal.
 
5.phone charges at good speed.
 
cons-
 
1.battery has to standout as a big con for this flagship model from xolo,if you are a data user on 3g ,it just can handle between 60-90 mins top,its a no match for the price paid for the device and the device configuration.
 
2.picture quality is excellent but feels to be on the brighter side,true color seems to missing out or it must have something  to do with the contrast,gamma,hue setting.
 
3.music quality with stock earphone is disappointing.
 
4.non removable battery.
 
5.rom build is not acceptable at all for something which you have priced above all of your product,needed it to be a lot optimized with good features and a customized launcher,what is hive all about?
 
well these are some pointers i can come up with while i post,i have been xolo loyalist for 3 years now,have purchased quite a few of them.
 
xolo is amazing in coming out with exciting products now and then.
 
suggestion to xolo - being the flagship model of xolo i expect some updates and changes for the good of xolo play 8x - 1200.

;;;;;does this handset support 3D games;;;;;there is no split to install applications and data unlike micromax knight. all 28 gb usable memory can be used for apps.;;;;;Yes, the battery is a big issue when playing games or the camera. Also face heating issue when games and camera on.;;;;;I am using this phone for the past 6 months now. Overall, this phone is good but there are some performance issues.  Display and camera: The display at 441 ppi is perfect and the camera quality is excellent too. The front camera is good for selfies; however, there is an issue with shots taken at an angle. Battery and heating: The battery when calling and when the phone is not is use is brilliant. But for camera usage and gaming, the battery performs poorly, and will go from 100 to 0 in less than 45 mins. (continuous usage). Network: You will get perfect 3G network is most places; however, at some premises, the network is a major challenge. I have tried the phone with Airtel as well as Vodafone sims and same issue. Design: While this is is purely a preference issue, I can guarantee that the phone is sleek. but the screen to body ratio could be better; especially the bottom part of the phone. If the network and heating issue is fixed, this phone is a great buy at the price it is offered today.

I recently bought a XOLO PLAY 8X 1200 mobile phone from a mobile dealer at Borivali on 3/10/14. The sole reason why I bought a Xolo mobile phone was because the company in promotion of this particular mobile handset had stated that it had a Octacore processor, and that its other features were far superior in comparison to mobiles in similar segment. The company however conveniently concealed that none of these features functioned effectively within anatomy of their mobile phones. On first time use the mobile started displaying issues such as fast battery discharge, mobile being hung up, failure to run pre installed apps.... Since being put to use the handset would require long hours of battery charging however, once being fully charged the battery would exhaust within 2 - 3 hours. Also, there was an extensive heating problem when used continuously for more than 10-15 minutes. As these issues arose within first week of use, I immediately contacted their service center. But to further aggravate my plight, their service executive stated that it would take about 30 - 45 days to rectify the defect and that the mobile was required to be sent to their only service and repair center in India at Noida. Despite having spent crores of rupees on their brand promotion and marketing, the company did not find necessary to have one Repair and Service center in a metro like Mumbai, which has its largest customer base.   ;;;;;xolo play 8x 1200 is grate i buy this and i fell that ;;;;;Its value for money device.

Hence even with other good points u cannot enjoy once ur phone interupts constantly. Initially its all well but a few months(4 to be precise) and ur phone goes for a toss. Its repair centers are scarce hence its a big issue. The last time I had this issue soon after the purchase after 1month of trying to repair it at the xolo service center they sent me a new piece bcoz it was in warranty period but yet again with this new piece I am facing the same issue. Wouldn't suggest anyone to buy it. I bought it out of total patriotic feeling to give an Indian brand a chance but sadly might not make this mistake again.;;;;;bring these phone in south africa please ;;;;;Can we update or expect update of Lollipop/Marshmallow in future?;;;;;I m using this phone guyz.... worst phone poor battery backup, poor updates, poor software, wifi not working well;;;;;very poor phone. i purchase this phone september 2014 and it was very good but only one year running its PCB is not working properly. i change it PCB but now today it will same problem repeat. how can i trust this phone. pls don't purchase this phone. very poor performance of this mobile.;;;;;i want to buy xolo black 1x is it good or not.?;;;;;The worst phone ever built by mankind :( The phone gets switched off after every call, and it started getting switched off during the calls as well recently. Since yesterday, the switch on/off button has stopped working, making the phone practically unusable. My collegue's phone also conked off on 31st December night. Service centres are absolutely hopeless..;;;;;I love this phone it's almost year and half since I am using this phone. Till now no problem, but yes you can say at that time when I bought this phone, the price was on the higher side(Rs. 13,500). The phone design is awesome. Each and every hardware is working fine.  Camera Quality is far more than enough, Display is of very fine quality. Back-up is also quite decent on 3G it gives back-up for 18-22 Hrs. On 2G the back-up goes up to 26-28 Hrs. Only one problem is that you will not found any software updates from the XOLO. The last update came in April 2015. Apart from Software update and the price at which I bought it every thing is excellent. So as of now price i.e, 7000, I will rate this phone 9 out of 10(not considering Software Updates).;;;;;Dnt ever buy xolo product m using this hive 8x1000 wrost phn ever  Heating prblm Btry backup 5-6 hrs only M fed up wd ds product  Its totally waste of money;;;;;nonu you can buy this phone i think it is one of the best. see its configuration.;;;;;a good phone with poor network reception and battery back up...  and worst service centers and u ll never get a android version update from xolo...;;;;;Osm;;;;;i have to bought this phone plzz help me can i bought or not??? ;;;;;Plz help friends my xolo phone is never saw my sim card network....;;;;;Awsome Phone Good battery life Good camera;;;;;good;;;;;Worst phone ever.....to much heating problem and battery issues .........and auto aap installation problem how can i stop it...;;;;;dont buy this phone guys  1)low battery performance 2)phone heats a lot  3)when heating goes high the phone automatically switched off 4)only 6 hrs battery life for day when you hear songs  ;;;;;very sexy;;;;;One of the worst phone I have ever seen.

REPLY GIVEN BY SERVICE CENTER PEOPLE 1) sorry we are NOT PROVIDING service for people who are buying online. Sorry we cant help you, you can go now and he is telling directly WHO TOLD YOU TO BUY ONLINE AND TELLING AND WHERE  YOU WILL GO NOW ,your money is lost. 2) Again called eBay care ,they told me we will give replacement for mobile only if you bring DOA letter from any service center. 3)again i visited the xolo care in jayanagar and requested for DOA letter, he behaved in rude manner and told that, how many times i want to say we are not providing any service fpr people who are buying online. 4)i called xolo care toll free number and told the response given by the service center people in jayanagar ,Bangalore. They didn't help me. 5)i called many times and launched many complaints but response. 
6)After one week i got call from xolo care ,they told me to visit service center to take DOA letter,,i felt happy and visited service center ,people in care told please wait for few minutes we will give the DOA letter, so you will get replacement.

8)Next day i called xolo care not service center, care people told ,please bring new bill with new date ,so that we can help you in providing DOA letter, so that i mailed to EBay care regarding new bill and after 2 to 3 days i got new bill from eBay. 
9)i visited the service center in jayanagar Bangalore with new bill, he took new bill and said we will approve it to our higher authorities and we will call you within 4 days. 
10)afer 2 days i got call from service center people, sorry your DOA is not approved so you need to spend 6000 rupees for repairing this device{{{{{{(((("""""" here on day one he told we are not providing service for people who are buying online, again after one week he told DOA letter time has ended, now he is telling not approved and asking 6000 rupees for repairing the device*******EVEN A SINGLE HOUR ALSO I DID NOT USED THE MOBILE.

I liked this phone at first glance, however brand xolo was not my choice. Lets talk about the specification. The specification of this phone is at most worth the price bracket.Gaming without any lag. Sound low though. Phone heats while charging or gaming or on internet. Battery not that great. Premium look with gorilla glass on both sides thats really good. Hive helpful and easy.

If you play games... heavy 3D games or use WIfi or 3G for continuous long time or are constantly downloading something then YES the phone will get hot, but that is with every phone. I had the Galaxy S 2 for 3 years, and it got HOT in like 20 mins of playing 3D games. Same is with MOTO G 2,... infact in Moto G even if you use camera for sometime it will get hot. The popular craze Xiaomi Mi3 too gets HOT. So as long as the Heat is not too high and unbearable, I you should not worry. To download the OTA.. goto Connect>Software Update> you should get the latest update. Hope this helps. ;;;;; ;;;;;I don't know;;;;;This phone is awesome bu it's battry backup problem;;;;;I love this phoneqq;;;;;How can we assign different ringtones for two sims;;;;;thanks fr ur reviews..... today only i ordered hive mobile in snap deal eith good n attractive price of 11k. thanks a lot friends... i am lookng after fr my phone..... i love it//,,,,nd i really miss it..plz come fast to meeeeeeee darling...aaahhhhhh...;;;;;this phn is awesome;;;;;i have this phone XOLO Hive 8X-1000 but it is facing heating problem. do you have any solution for that.;;;;;great phone no isue;;;;;Excellant Specification;;;;;Performance is incredible, was surprised by speed, absolutely lag free;;;;;People looking to spend around 12-13K should look at this device, without doubt. It has bugs but the good part is Hive team listens. They have already fixed heating issue of the device. Battery management is improved.  A few widgets had issues with update and removal they fixed that too.  Users asked for Gesture controls, Viola... Xolo provided that too. So as far as the support goes, Xolo is trying its best. Issues that people are talking about mainly heating and battery drain, well those aren't that bad. Heating is fixed and it does get mildly hot like any other device like Moto G or Xiaomi Mi3 and so it is nothing unbearable.  
Battery drains faster from 100 to 80% and then somehow stabilizes and last for a day or normal WIFI, calling, browsing, downloading apps, casual gaming and watching one movie, etc. Heavy Gaming will last for around 5-6 hours. So really battery is not that bad as a lot of people are saying. To get the best out of it use the power app that comes built it. It optimizes the CPU processes smartly so it does not interfere with your usage and still conserves the battery.
 
Connect and Edge are good. Themes are limited but are pretty interesting and refreshing.
 
Xolo provides it's very own Secure app to track, lock and remote wipe your cell in case it is lost.
 
Screen is excellent...period.
 
Camera is better than what you can expect in a 12-13K handset and low-light photos using Pro mode are particularly surprisingly good.
 
No Lags, Smooth overall. Small little features that are good and handy.
 
Overall it is a very good effort and Xolo should be complimented for it.
 
I have been a long term Samsung user using it's S2, Note 8.0 and Grand 2 and still I really liked what Xolo has done with Hive and overall the handset is value for money.
 
The negatives are not as grave or serious as a lot of people are saying. At least I haven't faced any issue so far. No crashes, no hangs, no unbearable heating or no Significant battery drain.
 
Go for it if you have a budget or 15K. Currently it is available under 13K. Plus with the money you can save you can always buy the Xiaomi 10400 mAH Powerbank at 999 and have constant battery backup....

;;;;;Hi This is one of the great feature of this mobile. The Front glass is made of Dragontrail glass and this is very sturdy, unstracable and doesn't brake easily for normal falls. you can search for Dragontrail glass in goole and there are tests being done on this glass to show how sturdy it is. Back case is also make of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is also hard to get stratches and Brakes.

Enjoy!!!;;;;;Does it have a multicolor led Notification ..? And. .  What about gaming performance..?;;;;;just tell me this set is good or bad;;;;;Finally I bought this phone on Sept 8,2014 I have already used Xolo's many mobile phones.I think I have used almost every mobile phones by Xolo.I surprised every time .The way they created their position in a terrific competitive market that is excellent. Now talking about Hive 8x-1000. U all know the specifications very well that's y am not repeating. This is one of the finest phone I have ever used.Sony to Samsung to Nokia to Mixromax ,I have used bunch of mobile phone in my life.Am telling u this is great. Looks- Wow. Design-Amazing Built-Brilliant Now talking about software part. 
Good,light wait,highly customized, u just need to engaged with ur phone for a day to understand how to apply themes & wat exactly Hive is.But its easy.I think it is good but not like a big thing.it's normal cz its just a ui.Xolo marketed this phone with Hive.&that is a technical marketing. But overall its good.ultimately a fresh look
 
Home button & back button is like a dot.so u need to habit of pressing a dot rather a arrow.but looking cool 3 dots .
 
Back panel made by glassso it looks really cool but problem u faced that is fingerprints. U will not get any cover for 8x...so apply a screen protector on the back panel like I did.
 
Camera quality is really great.
 
Talking about processor & all 
Octa-core processor device - Good for gaming. 
But think about ur octa core device.y????U guys are complaining about 1920battery... 
We all know 1920 is not enough but guys & girls this is not possible that u can find everything on a single device.if xolo placemah. 2200mah..then we would say we need 3000...so its normal..& this is normal for every brand's phone
 
Sound quality is decent. I don't know y u guys submitted negative post .its really good out put in speaker as well as in headphone
 
Accessories are poor.Xolo doesnt think about it.
 
Visual- I think they can put 1080p screen...but 720p with a294ppi doesn't disappoint u.if u look on the screen u will feel that it's a 1080p screen.also viewing angles are good. 
Wat mainly disappoint me that is call quality .it is not good but not so immpressive.but u can manage  
Overall its a great device .u must think about the price before write something. Its cost around 13000...& u r getting everything wat u want.from looks to performance.
 
Thank You

N Heating just tell me which phone does not? when playing high end games. I hv tested Lumias 720,520,625 as friends hv that n many androids too so STOP it it's annoying...I think some People want to play music on 8x at Chandani chowk that's why they complain about low Volume. No Lags so far No crashing of apps WiFi is ON for 6hrs daily battery still lasts for a day I think XOLO gave me a Special Piece or others are Exaggerating :P;;;;;Hey I hv seen two coloured notifications so far Red and Green.

Battery is not that as some Loosers are saying.;;;;;Hi Mitul i would like you to correct some comments that you have posted for xolo 8x-1000 Con1: Definitely poor battery as compared to IPS screen and octacore processor. Battery is a 1920mah which is non-removable but that gave me decent backup for more that a that a day  with fair 3g usage,  multimedia and wifi usgae. The batter  drops to 65-70 % within 30-40mins of usage once fully charged but with the 65-70% we can sure stand a day with moderate usage. If you a high end gamer or mutimedia  freak dont go for it. But i would say it can handle the 1.4octacore processor and hiveUI usage(this was i told when i contacted xolo service head regarding this concern) Con2: Once we set a ringtone from SD card it get backs to original tone as we reboot the phone. I dint get this problem with the phone and i tried it several times. I triedto set a ringtone and rebooted the phone which did kept the one that i set. you might have someotherissues with ur handset if you are using one 
Con3: Can't remove google search bar and weather and date widget from home screen. 
Thats true and its little annoying. However xolo runs hive over kitkat4.4.2 much of the stock andriod features are maintained for example the widgets. Howere in motog 
motox also we cant remove the google search bar 
 
Con4 :Yes it surely gives a heating problem. 
I dint get any heating problem with normal usage yet with 10days of usage. However tried playing asphaut 7, dead trigger and temple run the phone got hot like anyother  
budget android phone. 8x-1000 heat can be felt more because of the corning glass panel at the back unless the plastic used in other phones
 
Con5 : Scratch guard not applied properly at all. 
Mine was perfectly blended with the Asahi Dragontrail glass in the front.If you are notsatisfied you can remove and use the additional guard that is provided with the  
handset
 
Con6: Opted for facelock now can't move back to slide lock don't know how to enable. 
I used facelock and am using it till date with no issues. Bro i think consider replacing the phone.
 
Con7: Terrible sound problem with ear piece and speakers both are very low. 
It gives good output through headset with the fusion fx palyer and google play music with its inbuilt fx equilizer. However i agree to the loudness of the external 
speaker where on the bottom we have two grill for the speaker which makes us think it is dual speaker but only right side work other one is a dummy grill
 
Con8: Being 5inch screen it should have come with full keyboard with number tabs. like samsung provides in its big size screen phones. 
No comments depends on your personal opinion
 
Con9: Mail notification tone not working just led light blinks. 
I dint find any specific notification alert that can be set for mails. It is general tone for notification and works fine.However we cannot change or set  
notification light colors it has red and green 
 
Con10: Left side speaker not working. 
On the bottom we have two grill for the speaker which makes us think it is dual speaker but only right side work other one is a dummy grill,however dual speakers would have 
been much appreciated
 
Con11: Problmes With Phone Vibration Sometimes Only It Works & Vibrates. 
Bro consider changing the hanset or try a factory reset but i dint get it personally and such kind of a problem not reported by anyone else. might be hanset specific
 
Final verdict by mitul: 
I Dont Think So One Should Buy This Phone Till The Above Problems Are Solved. 
Final Verdict: 
Phone looks are awesome and gives premium look and the hive UI is refreshing however they are missing some features which we hope can be added in the future with OTA updates. 
Rear Camera is 8mp i would say is not that great but no that bad. It uses sony exmor sensor which takes decent and great pics in daylight and in normal environment  
with flash the color production and details are above average but not that great. 
Front cam is fixed focus and i would say not that great for 2mp but you can do decent video chat 
Expect the battery fact and lack of loudness of external speakers you can go for it if you are a moderate user.

Please keep posting your user experience regularly. I am buying this phone next week as soon as it is available with the nearest retailer. I would like to go for it after knowing all the necessary pros and cons from users like you! :) Please post again on the battery performance in detail if possible! ;;;;;can anyone using this device tell me its antutu benchmark scores please....thanks;;;;;Hey is there any heating issue with this device? I have bought this phone on 20th aug. Bt on 24th i found the temp of my phone was rising beyond 50 degrees. So there was a pop up coming that tje battery os overheated please remove the battery. Now i am going to replace the phone.  my query is that is this a problem with every phone?;;;;;Can u please inform whether word,excel documents can be edited & saved in .doc, .xls format.;;;;;Thanks for the update Prajval. I usually am in office for 12 hours in a day...and rest of the time at home using wifi. So I think if I start the day at fully charged battery, it should work well for the whole day as I do not have 3G connection nor wifi in office. What do you think buddy? ;;;;;Bought this phone couple of days back n guess what I Felt Lucky :).( canceled MI3 n Zenphone) Everything is good about this phone, bought this even after considering the battery coz I went crazy for the Look's. Camera, Performance, screen just awesome as u can read other reviews. But let me clear one thing battery lasts a whole day on average it drop's to 60% in some hours but then it takes you through whole day. I questioned Xolo guys before buying this phone about battery here's their reply  This is a response from HIVE on your comment. Admin response: Dear Atul, though battery is 1920mAH, XOLO 8X 1000 uses an ARM core running at 1.4GHz. HIVE also comes with built in power optimizer which helps in conserving battery. If you are facing issues, we request you to report it to the nearest service center \r\nwhere it will be resolved. To locate a service center near you , please visit   Below is the details of your comment 
Your Comment: hi waiting for this mobilesince two weeks. First look made me crazy had hands on at ezone.But battery is d onlything bothering me n NO SATISFACTORY answer from ur side. Cancelledmi3 for it. U going to ccomment on battery?? I should just change my mind u say....
 
No lag issues so far,speaker sound is good until u want to satisfy a hall full of audience,headphones rock. N hey it's always good to buy a product from Indian company. Played heavy games no issues just battery drains fast, but obvious. 
Something's I didn't like, BELIEVE ME THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS LOVELY PHONE except it's Fingerprint magnet again obvious due to glass back n NO OTG. 
Comes with two screenguard(one applied) 
Just go for it.

This will relieve all of us regarding battery performance. I am going to buy this phone next week, so I request you to keep updating this post regarding your experience with 8x-1000.

Though both priced similar I would like to know how is the performance with the Wifi. Is the phone able to catch the Wifi signals properly and what is the range that it can work properly. This is a very big issue with almost all the Chinese brands and they under-perform while watching movies on Youtube or while downloading something when using WiFi. Your answer will really help me to make my decision. Also how is the performance with the secondary camera for selfies. Has someone uploaded any sample pics so far. Anything more that you would like to bring to notice is always welcome.

I havent yet gone through with OTG. Sound is not very good but its acceptable, i have made some suggestions to the developers on HIVE. And they are trying to improvise it. Once more i would like to applaud the innovation of HIVE which seems to be very helpful.  And the device is on my high priority list for any1 expecting to get a good device with fine service guarantee within 20k. Samsung has no doubt the brand value but then it carries high price tag to offer less hardware. 
 
Micromax has good hardwares vut lacks the premium feel specially that punch logo on the back is too cheap.
 
Xiaomi offers excellent hardware but then they r fresh n need to create service satisfaction first.
 
Whereas XOLO stands out coz of only this device i feel its the best bet over others.;;;;;How can u say that USB OTG is not supported bro..

Itz like goin 2 a war with a pistol if u kn0 wat i mean;;;;;Bought it on 14th August at Ezone Kolkata @ Rs.14000. These r my review Phone looks pretty good n solid resembling Xperia Z series a lot. It is already fitted with screen guard out of the box and has a extra screen guard in the box.  The glossy gorilla glass at the back is very much finger print prone. Though rubbing it on cloth makes it shine beautifully.  The dual sim tray is innovative.  The display is OK. I don't like the extra brightness which is whitish.  It seems it looses the punch. (This may b unfair considering I'm using Galaxy S4 & comparing the display with it is unfair) Hive is OK. But like the response 4m the admin on ur queries through the blog.
 
Camera is Good. Doesn't loose much details on zooming. Though it's grainy.  I was very amazed at its night outdoor shot which proved to be more bright than my galaxy s4. Thumbs up to it. 
 
Battery may be mere 1920mh. But it worked whole day 4 me with pretty much used whatsapp, fb, video, camera and few calls. Lasted whole day with 25% battery left. 
 
While playing videos on mx player it did jerk when swiping to forward. But when changed to software decoder it worked fine. 
 
Only disappoint was speakers which doesn't seem to be loud. Even if you are using headphones. May be because of the music i was playing. 
 
Light games like temple run don't lag at all. 
 
Overall there was no lagging.
 
I believe it is definitely very good but in its price range. Before buying this device i did lot of research of phones in this price range n found each and every phone lacks something or the other however this handset had it all in it though some feature might not be the best of all but it is surely the best buy amongst other phones in this range. 
 
Thumbs up for the looks and feel and also the camera and overall performance. 
 
I would definitely suggest any 1 this mobile. ;;;;;Does this mobile support otg?;;;;;only on ezone online store. any date of avail date. Or any other phone with this spec in this price range;;;;;its 4.4.2 kitkat only price is too high its available on ezone ;;;;;some where its showing 4.4 kitkat, whats the actual its 4.2 or 4.4 OS KITKAT ????;;;;;I have been a great fan and promoter of xolo mobile not only because of the quality and affordability but also because its an Indian company. Have been using q800 for past 1 yr, no issues excellent mobile only draw back - battery doesn't last more than 12 hrs. So even though with the hive using less battery, people expect battery to last atleat 24 hrs so 2500mah would be  good for hive. Also I hope xolo comes up with a 4.5 - 4.7 inch octa core mobile with 2ghz processor and 2gb RAM  good camera, excellent music and battery about 2500mah.....this is not just my opinion but the feeling of a lot of younger generation;;;;;Only @ ezone online;;;;;Its a Best Phone in look I like it  %%%%%%)))))((((((((%%%%%%%;;;;;its available in ezone online..;;;;;Check the Xolo website, the correct battery Mah is on there. that should help.;;;;;Do u really think dat 1920mah battery can handle a 2GB RAM, octa core, HD display smartphone???

I had a personal experience with the phone and I found that the battery is enough for this phone, because HIVE Custom ROM don't take so much of the battery. And as experienced by some other phones, the Mediatek MT6592M chipset also don't need huge battery. So, if removed it from your list jst because of battery, then... take it back!

Battery....???;;;;;Is xolo 8x 1000 has document viwer option?;;;;;atleast 17hour 2gb calling we want.. 11 hour very bad;;;;;Nice phone..bt battery problem is mostly android mobiles.;;;;;What is the weight;;;;;coming to battery its very very bad except that d phone specs's are rocking frnds.... Gionee M2 is giving 4200Mah why cant Xolo?????;;;;;it has no glonass;;;;;why people look at battery size? they should look and the battery performance. 11 hrs for 2g is vry gud. xolo is best company. ;;;;;Xolo people are Brain less.... every time they are making mobiles with one defect.... They will cover this defect in next model and by removing one of the existing features...... Everything is perfect except battery. Its should be atlease 3000mah for octa core , 2GB RAM.... even small kids also knows it.... :);;;;;Every thing is buildup with superb configuration possible in this price range. Excellent build quality, powerful engine, fast racing OS with elegant & crisp sharp display, brilliant camera graced with Sony Exmor-R Senser to make it high definition caputuring device, High capacity storage vault incorporated inside. This is my first and best choice now. The only sector in which it lags is the power bank sector. Only 1920maH battery and that too of Li-ion is really dissapointment factor for the customers. If XOLO powered it up with atleast 2500maH Li-po, no device will have guts to cross this guy's way. It will stand out as monopoly handset.;;;;;very very bad battery backup;;;;;This phone looks promising. Best in class by its specifications. I am also looking for the price of Xolo 8x 1200 in DELHI. Definitely my choice would be between one of the two. I am sure that the company is really looking forward to increase there customer base in India with these phones. Xolo will have to improve there after sales service centers to bring a mark in the Indian Customers. Rest all looks great as the company is growing with there excellent products. Thumbs up to XOLO.;;;;;xolo has provided battery saver core as well and processer is just 1.4 ghz which is true octa core so it might use lesser battery  and it does have a power saving mode...so dont worry and go for it and it consists of 720p screen with less pixel saturation which is an advantage towards saving battery. Think and then comment.;;;;;xolo what about battery life its only 1920 please don't buy only features doesn't matters ;;;;;The battry is more than 3500 mah;;;;;v v good phone in this range. now  mi3 time is over..in xolo  we see  memory card slot but not in mi3...and also xolo service centres but mi3???????? ;;;;;give battery 3000 & higher mah...;;;;;it has only 1920mah battery,is it good ?;;;;;Battery back up is must and think of for all smartphone ;;;;;Are u kiddin' me...octa core, 2GB ram, HD display with  this type of battery capacity..???? Really??? It won't even last for 4hrs...Use ur brain xolo...!!!;;;;;the config of the phone is terriffic for todays smartphone... but battery is worse 1920 mah li-ion it should be li-po OR 4000mah li-ion;;;;;the battery should be 3500mah and above for li-ion  and 2500mah for li-polymer;;;;;the battery should be more than 3500mah;;;;;Everything is suprb...... Kindly incres the mah of battery.;;;;;one of real smartphone we could specify... Capable of adobe flash & html in same android browser.... In a kitkat update.... Really a smartphone loaded with high end devices qualities.. In a low budjet phone.... A saluate.. To XOLO 8X1000.;;;;;wowwwwwwwww this is my choice now  no to mi3 love xolo as already using 3 phones bcoz it has memory card and double sim wowwww plz make it to 2500 mah as soon as poosible change it xolo;;;;;Xolo is joking with the battery. ;;;;;i don't know why xolo has done this big mitigation abut battery only 1950mh this is very disappointed for me because this phone was most awaited phone for me.  ;;;;;Saddd !!!  display is juz 294ppi..  they r juz tryin 2 compete wid Xiaomi mi3 wid d price;;;;;poor xolo...u guyzz always leave one major drawback in ur phones..this time battery is the major failure of the set...;;;;;i don't expect much from xolo.....i was knowing they will go micromax way & make us fool... the battery not even 2000 mah... ;;;;;Battery only 1920mAh ??? Every thing is gud except the Battery... big thumbs down !! -_-","[datetime.date(2017, 9, 21), datetime.date(2017, 8, 11), datetime.date(2017, 6, 26), datetime.date(2017, 4, 21), datetime.date(2017,

Bought it on Amazon.in for a really good price. Look & Feel is superb for a phone at this price. Back panel is a rubberised material which feels rich when compared to plastic (much better than Samsung's). This panel can keep scratches away by itself. Also the phone came with a screen protector on it and an extra screen protector in the box. Tested - Calls, Whatsapp, Video & Browsing (On Wifi)as these are the only things which I need on this phone. Opinion - Awesome. Go buy if you are low on budget and need a phone which is rich on features, looks and pretty much everything. Battery has stayed for 2 days on standby with very few calls. On Moderate usage this should last as per standards ( like charge once in a day) Concern - If there is a problem ever, I am worried about their service network. Fingers crossed that nothing should happen to this phone. Overall I am very happy about this purchase.;;;;;its dual standby or not??????????? camera quality ??????? google now loncher avalable or not?????? pls inform me.........;;;;; Hi Frd  plz tel me processor.

I have used lava iris 501 phone which i happen to drop a lot have dropped more than 30 times in its lifetime In which the glass over the display is broken at some 10th to 20th drop and phone was still usable. And then i bought xiaomi mi4i. No earphone in it ok lets forgive it. Then in 30 days i accidentally dropped a 1 rupee coin on the display and the phone became unusable. Then i repaired it for 4500 rupees as the display doesn't covered in warranty. Then again after 3 or 4 months i broke the screen again this time can't spent 4500 rupees again on it. So i changed it with a duplicate display for 1500 rupee. That was broken when i put the phone on my bag thats not xiaomi fault anyway The Phone costs me 7000 extra ( I bought earphone from mi site for 1000 rupees).  I am not saying the Xiaomi is producing bad phones but the display it is really not durable. And again my brothers xiaomi note 4 display broken on the first fall. But luckily usable. It cost him 3500 more. I would say comparing the prices at first not at all a matter anymore. I learnt it by my experience. How much it cost you at the long run that matters.;;;;;Its the worst phone ever I have used in my life .......maximum fr 3 months it was will work better but after 6yh month it will ruin your life......this phone doesn't work hangs a lot works by his own.

And you will write the same thing about it.;;;;;Pls do some changes who have bought this phone...  1. Increase the pointer speed in the settings to improve typing speed.   2 . Switch the back camera resolution mode to the highest ...I know it will not capture full screen photo but it captures with more details.. now full screen photos are now outdated as well.  3. Change the lock and desktop wallpaper..apply some colorful and hd wallpaper... its display will show its true colors...  I just applied  spiderman wallpaper on this phone..I am surprised to know about the display quality of this handset...Awesome Really true and natural colors.. When I compared with the display of many vivo oppo devices like vivo v3 max vivo v5 oppo F1s ..I have found z25 display to be more natural and vibrant...  4.Change the theme to the last one the third one ..I dont remember right now as m typing from my vivo V5 ....And z25 is with my brother who is living Ludhiana Punjab right now.. pls check on urself..  5. increase the vibration of keyboard to 28 level from the settings of the keyboard ..It will increase the typing accuracy..  
Guys I have observed that this handset is value for money and daylight camera is unmatchable ...U will find many to have a sharper image than this phone but in terms of skin tones and natural colors..its hard to find any phone in this price range.  even  vivo v5 plus didnt give natural effect ..

Lava,A97,";;;;;Yes I am playing gta vice city in my lava a97 1gb ram and just u need to disable some apps like lava app etc and not suitable for playing games above 600 or 550 mb it hangs.And Volte will disappear after some time.But not suitable for daily usage.It hangs.;;;;;Poor cellphone very hang device  noeveryone people buy it;;;;;Very annoying phone. Hanging, poor camera, bad looks, rubbish phone overall;;;;;Worst phone ever... Reasons :-  1) Rubbish items eat up almost 60% of internal memory. 2) Facebook doesn't respond properly. 3) Facebook Messenger doesn't respond properly. 4) Whatsapp messenger doesn't respond properly. 5) Recent call logs as well as contacts disappears. 6) The alarm doesn't perform when it is removed from the background. 7) Temperature rises up very quick. 8) A maximum of only 3 apps are installed for its bloody 1GB RAM. 9) Battery exhausts very quickly. 10) The VoLTE disappears after some time.
 
So , I request you to please improve the LAVA A97 and also other models of LAVA because no other chinese or international phones like Vivo , Oppo , Redmi etc. shows up problems like this. Also, I am selling the phone day after tomorrow only for &#8377; 3,000 , which shows that others also know what LAVA is worth of. Freakin worst phone ever. I am going for Redmi and I'd also suggest to my family as well as friends never to use LAVA.... Thank-you.;;;;;why do people say  about disappearing contacts ...i used to play heavy games all the time ...but i have never experience such a thing ...like disappearing contacts ..the thing is ....you guys should use a keypad phone instead of using touch ones ;;;;;Worst phone in india..automatically change display colours.hide contacts..poor camera.do not work night mode..i miss more events in night time..i feel shame for buy this mobile.;;;;;Worst phone in india..automatically change display colours.hide contacts..poor camera.do not work night mode..i miss more events in night time..i feel shame for buy this mobile.;;;;;Just three months back bought a97 and it starts giving bunch of problems .

Initial review is given :- Battery : - Not upto the expectations of 2350Mah.  Lasts a few hours of regular usage.  Also take much time for recharging. Camera :- Front 5 Mega pixel is good enough for cellphies.  Good clarity also.  Back 5 MP is VERY BAD.  Having whitish mark on the image.  In low lights totally bad even after using flash. Screen : - If you tilt a bit then you cant see the screen clearly.  You can watch just like old type negative images. Back button has also to be hard press for functioning. Some time got restarted automatically.  Sometime hang itself.  Sound is also not enough. Anyway in this price an average phone for playing games of low resolutions.
 
However, latest android version is a plus point.

The processor could've been better, but after seeing its performance, I'm not complaining. It has a standard 2500 mAh battery, which gives a days' worth of performance on a single charge.

To start with its got a price tag of less than 6 grand with a decent battery back-up (2000mAh), 5MP and 2MP camera with a realistic display!!! Also it has 1GB RAM with Android Lollipop!!! The best part about this phone is that it never heats up or hangs, so you can do all the multitasking you want to! Which other phone offers features like these and in this price!!!! ;;;;;Say what? Dude, Lava A89 is a dream phone! One of the best from Lava! I mean, okay, tell me about another phone that costs less than 6k and still has amazing features like smart music controls, 4G VoLTE and, even a powerful Processor - RAM combo like this one? And even though it features a 2000 mAh battery, it is still capable of delivering a day's worth of battery backup with absolute ease. Now tell me, disappointment what?

I didn't get any ""battery back up"" as company said...;;;;;In my experience this phone is simply a big disaster.Nothing more.;;;;;I really like the way the Lava A89 looks. The design of this phone is very appealing and pleasing to the eye. For me the battery is of the utmost importance, and this one has that---2000mAh! But I'm  concerned about the overall specs, hope they are good! Has anyone used the mobile -- a feedback would be really appreciated! ;;;;;Really like the new Lava A89! It has some superb on paper features like the big screen 5"" screen, pre-loaded with Android 5.1, 1GB RAM and Quad Core Processor, which means it can easily support heavy gaming as well.

Of course, not everything is perfect, but, I would say that for the price of 5500, the phone offers pretty good features.

I will suggest A82 as it is cheaper than A79 .If you see the RAM both of them have same ram..just A79 has front flash, so incase you are not a selfie freak.. you can go for Lava A82 only.;;;;;90% of the features are similar in both the phones.

Lava Iris Atom 2x-  4.5-inch screen  Price: 5.     Lava A82: 5,299 INR 6.     Lava Iris Atom 2x- 4,899 INR I feel that the price should be overlooked as we are getting better features in Lava A82.

Which is clear from basic to top models. This phone also has better build quality than Micrmax, Karbon and Intex etc. Camera quality is just average. Other than that phone is good.

Extensive memory, powerful battery (2500mAH), Android 5.1 (so almost the latest feature) thankfully with the promise of new upgrade! (so don't worry about wasting your money on an old model), amazing sound quality is what the phone is offering. The battery is not bad either though the low lighting condition can be a problem!

The pictures that they click are crisp, clear and highly detailed, even in low light. Try to clean the camera lenses of your Lava V2 and if that doesn't fix your problem, then maybe visit the service centre to get it fixed by professionals or a replacement.;;;;;Lava V2 comes with a powerful 2500 mAh Li-Poly Battery that can easily last a day. Check what all apps are running in the background. Go to settings and check which app is using the most amount of your battery. If it's there for a necessary function then leave it, but I it's not, I would suggest to either stop the app or uninstalling it completely. This should stop the battery drain. Also, if you're using high contrast setting, lower them in order to conserve battery life. Video chat is supposed to be a drain on battery as you have to constantly keep the screen on. I would suggest closing all the background apps and reducing the brightness.  BTW you answered yourself, that if you continue to use your ohone continuously its defi. Gonna back fire man! Keep that in mind!;;;;;using mobile is quite good, but it's battery backup it's not so as its presents while continuing video chat and gaming  it's battery slow down quickly, sometimes its touch response slow...... ;;;;;No;;;;;V2 3GB is supervphone in such lower price..but the camera is working as 5 MP back & 2 MP front instead of 13 & 5 MP.;;;;;Apps can move to sd card or not.

Thinking about buying one for myself now and would also recommend others to go for the Lava V2 without any doubt.;;;;;I got myself the Lava V2 smartphone (3GB version) and I'm quite satisfied with the performance. See I'm not a techie, so don't expect the technical mumbo-jumbo from me.  Â	Works like a charm, no lag! That is a MAJOR-MAJOR plus in my books! Â	Best part, comes with Android 5.1 with a guaranteed update to 6.0!! So even smoother performance, plus who doesn't like getting the latest things in their kitty, eh? Â	Big screen so the view is clear and big and makes the viewing experience new! Â	Don't care about the camera much, so its pretty much okay for me!  Â	Battery to me seems okay, lasts about 10-12hrs on a single charge. So good enough! For 10,149 INR, it sooo worth it!

Has seamless speed with its 4G feature, makes downloading faster! has the lastest android so smooth UI+faster connectivity! Look wise also, not so bad deal! ;;;;;I have used Lava A76 for a couple of days and here's my review based on that. I must say I'm quite impressed by it. After using the Blackberry curve phone for 2 years, my brother gifted me this phone and it's completely amazing!  Apart from the fact that it has a 4G connection with a great speed, this phone has a decent camera (the primary one). The battery is okay-ish if you consider the price and the specs that it comes with! However, the touch is smooth and the nice UI allows for easy multi-tasking. Though it does heat up if I use it for long, it is still the best phone that I've ever had.;;;;;Lava A76 as I feel is a good 4G enabled phone in just 5,699 INR. I am going to buy it soon once I get my pocket money. And I don't think I need to keep another phone for making calls as this phone provides good connectivity and comes with headphones as I attend calls while driving. Battery life could be much better but it's fine as we have other amazing features.  This phone seems like a perfect fit for those who don't want to spend a lot of moolah for a basic hardware smartphone with good software features. Actually, I will buy it only for its 4G connectivity.;;;;;When I heard about Lava A76, I immediately looked it up online. The phone costs only 5,699 INR and runs on Android 5.1 version. I have already recommended it to my friend who was looking for affordable 4G enabled phones. This phone is up to the mark with his expectations for a phone. It clicks pretty pictures and runs pretty much everything due to its 1GB RAM. If only it can get an Android 6.0 Marshmallow upgrade, it'll be just perfect.;;;;;I really like this phone...

After two months of using (Lava A72),I faced battery problem.Charging process automatically stopped, and phone get switched off having 0% charge. I submitted it to Lava service center at Jodhpur park,Kolkata .But the people there,are just fooling the customers.The workers there,are surely fake.God knows, how a service center could be like this.The worst experience ever ...my Lava phone is now ,at my showcase and have bought a new phone few days back.;;;;;I am purchase this mobile on flip kart August 2016 ...Working 2months after that 3 problems is there 1.Dispel shaking 2.

However it's pros are that it's camera quality although lacks AF apperture, yet picks decent quality pictures even in low light due to both crunchy LED Flash light (Selfies as well rear). Battery back up although boasted 2500 Mah(Upto 2 days if not used frequently) is good, but not upto mark. 1 GB Ram is a bit downstate, yet a lot apps can be downloaded compared with Micromax Phones. However the biggest pros for this phone is price range as well as the HD IPS display with 294 ppi, 1.5 GHZ Quad Core processor which is faster than all it's rivals. Overall a very decent smartphone at this price range with a corning Gorilla Glass 3. Rate 7.5/8.00/10 Cons: Lava durability is good, but lacks as the phone hangs a lottttt. Not very recommended for gaming enthusiasts as not able to open the most fav game Candy Crush Jelly/ Candy Crush soda versions.;;;;;This is just Sucking..... hangs automatically switch off.......network issues are a big....my god im nearly dead with this bloody mobile. i hate it. and i bought before two days. please dont trust and buy such a sucker;;;;;Very happy with Lava A72 which I bought few weeks ago. Its 5MP camera captures clear photos and battery life is quite satisfactory! And as its OS can be upgraded to Marshmallow its performance is quite smooth.;;;;;Lava A72 is a 4G phone for less than 7K, which is pretty amazing. I have been looking for a 4G phone for my mom and I think lava A72 would prove to be a pretty good deal. The phone supports, lollipop 5.1(upgradable to marshmallow), good camera quality, lasting battery backup of 2500mAh and extensive memory, which is quite impressive. IÂm actually quite surprised to see that a Lava phone has such nice features. ;;;;;It is looking very good. Nice display, super fast 4g net work. No heating problem..  Nice voice clarity..

I guess you are over charging the phone that's why it gets heated up. Unplug it once it gets fully charged otherwise there will be problem in your phone. Also check whether there are any other applications are running in the background or not!! The high usage of the phone leads to its over-heating! Once that's understood and remembered you won't have any problem with the phone!  I am very happy with its performance.

With the big screen of 5"" HD display its been quite a delight for her especially in successfully reading smaller text easily and get entertained (courtesy movies and videos) and click decent enough pics. Plus the battery is a plus, the 2500 mAh Li-Po battery which charges once a day and lasts through out the day! And cuz shes a mom so its obvious that she needs a ringer that too a loud one and that what this one delivers! Overall IÂm pretty happy with the experience that this phone is providing to mom! ;;;;;My friend has the Lava X11 and uses it every day with grin across his face! Since it runs on Android Lollipop 5.1 (Guaranteed Upgrade to Marshmallow is promised) and the 1.5 GHz Quad Core Processor, it provides a brilliant performance.

That's just plain stupid.;;;;;this is selfie camera;;;;;the back panel design of this phone has been copied from nokia's android phones;;;;;boy cool down it is just hd have it from last 2 weeks got it from my uncle who is an employee of micromax buddy solan unit. screen is just 720 p not full hd;;;;;Why did they make the front facing cameras 20 MP and dual, when the rear camera is only 16 MP...;;;;;Do you have even a bit of knowledge when it comes to resolution??? It is not even full hd and you are talking about more than that. Just google it and try to understand if you can...;;;;;You are absolutely right brother.. This Micromax brand is nothing but just a kind of broker;;;;;it is good phone, using it from two days, fully satisfied with the performance, 18:9 aspect ratio is very good for smart phone, more area for information with less width to hold in one hand. Micromax should come out with new phone, 6.2 inches display, full HD 1080x2160, higher processor-600 series, 18:9 ratio. It will be much and more enjoyable. ;;;;;please give me suggestion this phone are good for purchase;;;;;I was very much happy to see this offering from Micromax but it disappointed me again Like it did for canvas dual 5 which is rebranded Qiku Q5 and now Canvas Infinity and Infinity Pro are rebranded Wiko View and Wiko View Pro. ;;;;;Looks like Samsung S8 have 5,7 inch screen and only 3000 mAh battery. WTF.  This is a really Xmas joke of 2017;;;;;This is good..in chiness brand u didnt talk...hd full hd;;;;;INFINITY pro has 20+8 mp front facing camera and back 16 mp,so it has missing INFORMATION. NOTE;- OREO is note preloaded in this device, it was coming soon via updates. plz update dis info....;;;;;  Just 11k;;;;;Bad luck, it's just 3000mah.  Y Don't u go for yureka 2, it's a beast  ;;;;;Check over flipkart,. Its available for 13+k;;;;;Bud, it's more than full HD..  Grow up;;;;;still not a full HD display don't know what micromax wants to achieve with this;;;;;This phone can change the history of Micromax. Waiting for it......;;;;;mobile super but i want 4000/4500mah battary;;;;;Most are coming today with 18:9  aspect ratio screen selling around 18k with nearly no protection on screen this is trend these days so cell manufacturing companies are going with same practices which are likely to cost them less, This is the story for all mid range phones selling under 18k . Less value for money to the customers.;;;;;Just check ""Imagination Technology""(Power VR) website  Have a nice day ;;;;;am not sure bro .... but having a feeling its the wiko view prime for the design n camera setup combo of 20 mp and 8 mp front camera .... and moreover canvas infinity was a rebranded wiko view;;;;;are you sure bro ?;;;;;FHD+ 1080/2160  MT-Hello X25 Octa-core PowerVR 6250 ;;;;;Looks good.;;;;;720*1440 and snapdragon 435 octacorer;;;;;If people were actually that bothered about the 'ugliness' of a phone (even enough for them to be considered ""The ugliest phone of 2017"")....then they just wouldn't buy it. That's why a lot of Apple fans are refusing to buy the X, the design just rubs them the wrong way. Watch ANY comparison of a ""bezel-less"" phone vs a traditional 2016 bezel phone (e.g. U11 vs S8) and the reviewer will 9.5 times out of 10 comment on how the thicker bezels look ""outdated"" and how they prefer the thinner bezels. You're in a slim minority mate, accept it and move on.;;;;;No it is not rebranded.;;;;;No it's not, it had MT hello x25 CPU  with PV-Gx6250 GPU, with FHD+ screen 1080×2160 Wiko View Prime SD 430 CPU with Adreno 505 GPU, with HD+ screen 720×1440 ;;;;;Canvas Infinity or Canvas Infinity PRO is rebranded of Wiko View Prime? If Canvas Infinity PRO then how do you know?;;;;;Should have snapdragon 636 or 660 at least 4500 mah removable battery  quick charge 3.0 or above  gyro sensor;;;;;Because people dont have any other reliable option.  Its not my fail the manufacturers cant make proper phone but their.  So please dont score me like this.  I am sure the 75% of global population will agree that curved screens is just waste, bad idea and really Really REALLY bad move in phone market. But due to lack of other options (like people are blindfolded and brainwashed by apple or didnt had any other phone than Samsung and they are shy to try something new and not as expensive but with same or simmilar quality) these so called flagships are maybe top selling but i dont think so.  From 100% of global population is 95% vise enough to dont buy a phone for 1000+ eur because its tottaly waste if phone for 300-500 can do the same tricks for much less money.  For example i grow up long time ago from crying why my app is loading 1,4 seconds on my Lenovo Vibeshot if my mate from my work runs same app in 0,8 sec on his brand new Iphone 8 plus. ;;;;;this is the rebranded wiko view prime;;;;;""Why it must looks like world most ugliest phone of 2017 which is Samsung S8 S8+ Note 8 and Iphone X"" ""I think i was very precise. And at least 75% of the global population will agree with me."" ......which is why the 4 handsets you named are in the top 10 best selling phones of 2017??? LMFAO.;;;;;And yes people who game innovation award to curved screen design reflect only that it looks good for certain people. Apart it looks good have nothing to offer just a lot of disadvantages which always prevail over having a nice curved screen. So when i said they were brainless i was serious and correct.  If i can score from 1 to 10 i would say. 8 points for a innovation and 7 points for looking gorgeous 15 point total But i would take points for price curved glass is super expensive, for reacting on bottom panels which is really irritiating, no screen protector fits for a curved screen, and when it does you cant use any case because it will push away your screen protector. Also its very slippery for all these i would reduce 15 points to -30.  So again this innovation is usefull exactly as if we mount laser sight on a slinger :-);;;;;Man no matter how you look at i was correct. New curved glass trend brings only problems to people.  Apart it looks great to certain people (excluding me) it has nothing to offer.  Its expensive to made expensive to repair, owner of the curved glass phone cant use screen protector because it protect only middle of screen not curved bottoms. Even if you buy a curved screen protector it wont fits the phone because only like half inch of all the edges of protector is touched sticked to the phone rest just wont hold. Any case will push your screen protector out so it wont fit. Unless you buy a book case which half of the population dont like cuz they always have to open and close something.  And lot more.  In case of Samsung even a bottom panels on curved glass react on touch and if you press on some advertising or so the phone will lead you straight to the point you clicked even accidentally. I may continue forewer.  In my countra in Slovakia we dont have the Micromax Brand so i cant tell.  My hate is purely on curved screens and brands who copy this new useless super expensive trend. Its same like having a curved screen on your TV for certain people looks good but when you watch from angle you see nothing.  Billions of reasons.  You can say i am stupid but i am correct as well.  
Its my opinion i am freely presenting like you saying yours.  
Only one exception i dont swear on people.  
I think the fate punches them enough :-) 
;;;;;I could not edit the comment but realized you are not loyal to Micromax. You just hate this curved glass bezel less design trend,got it. Other than this part I don't take back what I've written in the previous comment.;;;;;The award giving groups are brain less?? You sound like a spoilsport. Micromax is crap period. There are much better phones even in the budget range that Micromax targets. You are loyal to the brand but you are borderline manaic. Seriously comparing to s8? Even calling s8 ugly ? It's really a laugh to read your comments. You hate curved display and bezel less phones OK point taken. Not everyone agrees with everything. your comments have already proved what others said about you. Hater and lost. Go ahead concrete your reputation with more manaic replies and lash outs . Smh. Thanks for the entertainment. ;;;;;Man when it falls on conrete it will breaks.  And i was talking about phone look not specs. Curved screen is useless. I know S8 is great phone but with useless curved screen it lost all the beauty. ;;;;;Man people in commision who game that award to Samsung phones were lese stupid or brainless. For certain people phone looks good.  But even a platter can be made from china historical art but as long as its empty wont feed you.  This is same case.  Phone can looks good but its the only thing to offer. Curved glass have much more cons than pros. ;;;;;Man Lol I'm unmarried though I can tell ur children  stories of this wonderful tech called curved display..U have a point abt protection but if u use Clearview flipcover it's absolutely safe from falls n scratches. Plus, aesthetically s8 series won the best design award;;;;;Man keep your stories to scary childrens at night.  I am working for a big phone company in my country.  Curved screen protector really exist but the part that only touches the glass is like 0,5mm from the bottom of whole screen. Any if you put any back cover it will push your screen protector then its useless.  I know what i am talking about i am selling phones and accesorize.  You have no idea how many complains i had on curved glass protectors.  You can have gorrila glass 10 but when it drops on concrette it will break. ;;;;;Well if you feel Micromax gives performance, quality and service, nothing much to say, you deserve brands like Micromax.;;;;;Man  Do u hv a s8 plus...U hv to feel d difference to use it n know abt it's curved display...And as for durability it's durable enough n u hv gr8 protective covers;;;;;Man beautiful phone looks different.  It have some bezels. Because bezel less phones looks like car without any bumpers and thats really ugly. Liike woman without boobs.  Anyway curved screen is expensive slippery and no screen protector is good for curved screen.  Want more reasons why to dislike phones like this? I think i was very precise. And at least 75% of the global population will agree with me. ;;;;;Its not as ugly as this year top models of Samsung Apple X and this Canvas infinity. ;;;;;Man wake up you are either blind or brainless sorry but its true. Curved screens are worst technolog made in past years. They are slippery in hands expensive to made and no screen protector is good for phones with curved screens.  Curved screens are useless as they could be. ;;;;;Man i am not hater  i am telling truth.  Curved screens are expensive and useless also very slippery in hands. ;;;;;We need performance and quality. What if nothing is Indian. We want service and we are getting that.;;;;;I wish I could feel like you do but Micromax is a big let down, nothing is Indian in the phone anyways, assembled cheap parts from China,. Hardware , software nothing Indian. Sadly the truth. At least they could do a good assembly job like Xiaomi ;;;;;ITS NICE TO SEE INDIAN COMPANY COMPETING WITH FOREIGN BRANDS.. If its comes woth fast charging along with a decent latest processor snapdragon 626/630 it would really be great.. But fast charging is mandatory now a days;;;;;It's come with dual Front Camera 20+8 MP & 16 MP rear,  3000 mAh battery,  Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 Android N 5.7"" HD(1440X720) with 450nits;;;;;If this phone atleast comes with snapdragon 626 processor and about 4000mah battery with under 13,000 I gonna buy it. So, please Micromax make India proud. Don't rebranding. Gyro sensor please.;;;;;well enough had been said about micromax.....Being an indian company i have some attachment with it...But always suspect their R&D team which is limited only for copying. waiting for true innovation from you guys.....Make us feel happy that you can achieve this....;;;;;""Why it must looks like world most ugliest phone of 2017 which is Samsung S8 S8+ Note 8 and Iphone X"" Just because the phrase ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" exists doesn't mean it has to be exploited like this....;;;;;Almost all rumored devices look like S8 now.;;;;;lost where? I am exact and correct speak to point but what you do? You ike something which have no use. And thats curved screens and bezel less phones. ;;;;;Man thats not hate its a real.  Now tell me where in the world will you buy screen protector for a curved glass.  Because paying 400 for repair its really something i dont want.  Its not about hate its about usability and curved screens have no use for me and for many people hating cuurved screens because you cant protect your phone enough and repair cost a lot.  Anyway bezel less phone is like car without bumpers or woman with no boobs.  Which is ugly. ;;;;;Man thats not true. To be honest i can afford Apple X even with wireless charger for 150 but why to have ugly phone like that and so expensive if for example Xiaomi Mi6 for 400 eur can do the same. Well waiting to load app 1 sec or 1,2 second time and cry why the phone is so slow thats niot my case. Anyway for me Iphone X have nothing better than Mi6 for example. ;;;;;No its definitely Samsung S8 S8 plus Note 8 and Apple X also this one because its looks like Samsung which makes everything from shawer or microwawe oven till TVs Hifis etc. A lot of quantity in devices with a low of quality in devices. ;;;;;LlooLl....Lolperia Xyz...xD;;;;;The most ugly phone in 2017 is suckny xflopria xz;;;;;Looks great!;;;;;Look really great;;;;;Another hater.... Like most of them, surely hates what  can not have, or even get near of.....;;;;;Like Infinity lunching date + price mention it ...;;;;;hahaha, such a hater!;;;;;You're so lost that it's laughable.;;;;;nice options to now 18:9 ratio (dedicated slot + dual sim) USB On-The-Go;;;;;Why it must looks like world most ugliest phone of 2017 which is Samsung S8 S8+ Note 8 and Iphone X;;;;;Frankly!

Becarefull and remove the battery immediately. It's happened to me about 4 times. The phone fell down from my hand because of so heat. Support person said it's consider out-of warranty :(  (2) Contact : Searching a contact will be difficult, it shows 4 names for the same contact. If you choose PHONE CONTACT only from settings the problem remains same. Not able to merge contact.  (3) DND : Your internet will disconnects if you are dialing (or) in call. You can't stop DND permanently.  
(4) Touch screen : You can't change Touch Digitizer separately. If touch broken then you have to change complete assembly. 60% cost of the product.  
(5) Dial : You can't dial at a single time, it's shows CALL ENDED immediately. You have try 2-3 times. Otherwise turn off the Data & WiFI then call will connects fast.  
(6) Micromax complaint portal : It's just for show. They never answer to you. Don't try there.  You have to send email directly to them. ;;;;;No;;;;;(1) It's not Li-Ion battery, It's a Li-Polymer Battery. Getting heat after 3 months usage.

(3) Dialing a contact will immediately shows 'CALL ENDED', You need to try 2-3 times. Orelse turn off Data & WiFi, then call will connect immediately. (4) Internet will disconnects while in call, You can't (never) turn-off the DND mode. (5) You can't remove MODI app. (6) Very Good customer support experience. But Poor service center experience.

The most important one is the user interface provided by the Micromax which is fantastic Words are not enough to describe the machine so just use and feel the sweetness in each touch.;;;;;I have the same phone brought from Amazon and it's pretty fine and square. Actually now I'm using it to type here and no problem for finger print and no lags ever occured. I ensure you that it's a ground breaking piece of Micromax. So first you check the one you have is original or not for that check the IMEI sites which ensure you the authenticity of the product IMEI no is obtained by *#06#. And if it's a original product, go to update it and if the problem exists go to Micromax authorised 24/7 service centre which will definitely return you the product in a maximum time of 24 hours.;;;;;Fingarprint problem and procescer slow typing not smoothly very poor device waste of money;;;;;compaire to redmi can it will recive next vergion update  after orieo? or it will stop reciving vergion updates like other mmx android phones. i m  asking because I m big mmx lover.;;;;;I just wants to know that -can mmx  infinity capable to recive next vergion update after oreo? its hardware or software suitable for that? anyone answer please. ;;;;;Yesterday I'm dropped this unfortunately the display costs 4200 rs .

Like s8,s8plus and vivo v7plus have full screen option playing video in you tube.;;;;;this is good phone i like it.;;;;;8/10 for my application and objectives. I preferred this phone due to removable battery and >5.5 inch.  After immediately opening the box, I struggled lot to open back cover, as no instructions were given in the help book. Somehow, from YouTube I opened. Charging is fast at the same consumption of battery is also slightly fast when compared with Lava pixel V1. May be due to increased screen size. At first I worried whether it could fit in my pocket for regular use or not. No worry at all, it is very comfortable, for regular use.  Front camera is good. Back camera medium.  
No much problem with finger sensor.
 
Sometimes battery and speakers are getting slightly heat.
 
Overall the phone is fine for regular use.;;;;;Thanks. .I have booked this phone...;;;;;This is the best phone with this price.;;;;;existing phone : Moto G3  Bought infinity a week back, the phone is fun and great for average user but I am somehow not impressed with its rear camera, the images are lot grainy especially indoor, this was quite disappointed. The Ram is one GB free out of 3 GB as the android OS alone consume 1 GB RAM. Build's look and feel quite premium however more prone to scratch considering it does not have gorilla glass, additionally back hit the same constraint as well. and last thing, the finger printing is not very fast and works 6/10 attempts, that was not expected. rest all is great including battery back which last entire day for a normal user. 
good luck thought I am not too impressed and eying for moto G5 plus my dad is having :D;;;;;I'm thinking of buying this phone... I need the suggestions of existing users whether to buy it or not;;;;;God it's snapdragon price.really s.r.no.tel me frnds ;;;;;Hi to everybody I am purchase this Mobile phones five days back.The phone was super battery backup also super .Better than others Mobile costs also not but .;;;;;Performance is fine for a normal user. If you are into gaming go for other choices. But if you want to enjoy Infinity dispaly at a budget price go for Canvas infinity. I have not faced major lags or heating problems till now. Multimedia is good. No call drops. Battery is fine. But you must use a genuine tempered glass as there is no glass protection. Remember you are paying 9999 for a infinity dispaly. Choice is yours.;;;;;How is the performance?  Does it lack like shown in You Tube.. Does it Heat that Bad?  Wanna buy But I wonder if I will Regret..  Canvas infinity or Mi Note 4?;;;;;It's phone is not gorilla glass;;;;;Value for money as it has fingerprint sensor, Is lightweight, has front flash, portrait mode in camera, clear sound. I guess if you get all this in 9999 , then it's worth it. the lg bezel less model does not have a fingerprint sensor.  Satisfied with product;;;;;It's not totally worth to buy. In my country Xiaomi with Snapdragon 808 and full hd screen only cost 120$. ;;;;;We are paying 9999. So naturally for this price you cant expect more. I agree there are drawbacks like low resolution which is barely noticeable. But for the price you pay it is definitely worth. Choice is your's. Innovation at a handy price.;;;;;I have been comfortably using it for more than a day after using Internet and Multimedia. Games i dont know as I dont play.

We cannot buy it just for infinity display when all the other things are worst. Lg q6 is better;;;;;True.. I already registered. ;;;;;At the price of under 10,000, i think it is a good smartphone. Not perfect but still a good one. The only thing i didn't like is the 2900 mah battery. Its a bit low capacity in compare of other smartphones at the same price range. ;;;;;This is the only Indian mobile under flagship,,,;;;;;Copying from Sharp Aquo Crystal is a nice idea lol! But how come the S8 S8+ display dimensions is too long? When you play the YouTube, you must found 2 big area at the left and right is totally blackout, it isn't a convenience viewing experience. ;;;;;Samshits were nothing are nothing and will remain nothing in front of Micromax Canvas. Go ahead;;;;;That's a good phone with rubbish processor only 3gb Ram and non sense design !!! SD625/626 just kicks ass of Exynos 7870 !!!;;;;;At around 20k get Samsung J 7 pro ;;;;;Absolutely;;;;;Because I never needed specs anytime ask needed was style and now the reason why my parents are scolding is that I want to sell YU Black and get Infinity but I won't do that since it has for Android 7.1.1 !!!;;;;;ok lets wait for diwali guys. because i am assuring u micromax will bring infinity pro and pro s with full hd infinity display. and will have a better chipset and better camera. thats a secret news and i can confirm u now. will be priced somewhere near 20k;;;;;Yup I know that Micromax has given android n to yureka black. Btw yureka black is a great phone why u parents are scolding :p ;;;;;in such price you want apple features...:P;;;;;Micromax canvas infinity this is first 5.7inch full vision phone under 10k any other company in the world. This phone have super pixel mode in camera and bokeh mode in which photos most beautiful than any other phone.this phone have Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 cpu with 3gb RAM and have 32gb internal memory with separate memory card slot with dual sim 4G volte phone.this is Amazon exclusive phone so who want to buy this phone register on amazon.in its first sale on 1 SEP. So register and get ready to buy Canvas infinity the most affordable 5.7 inch full vision display with 16mp super selfie camera and 13mp rear camera .this is full powerful entertainment multimedia handset which can comeback Micromax in top 5 mobile phone company in India. This is game changer handset in Indian mobile market. ;;;;;I think....you r right,  the peeson is totally nonsense ;;;;;f/2.0 is better then f/2.2 while f/1.7 is more better but having such a price as above 30K. So it's great;;;;;It is not rebranded. It is made by micromax own.infact, it is a great handset, one can go for it.;;;;;This actually kinda look more like LG G6. But can anyone tell me if this is actually a micromax original or just a rebranded? If rebranded then which phone? If not rebranded then it kinda looks cool. ;;;;;Initial supplies are usually made in China with some issues buy later to get made in India version of the phone with less issues;;;;;Aperture f/2.0 is small and not big, big Aperture is f/1.7 yeah what about Aperture f/2.2 on Redmi devices and Moto and Lenovo devices at this price range have same f/2.0 Aperture !!! Pure nonsensical person !!!;;;;;You love it.... I'm buying it actually I though they would price it rs12k I got the specs correct so was a bit worried but @ &#8377;10k this becomes a must buy !!! My parents are scolding me now that I got YU Yureka Black..... And hey Kysiske do you know My YU for Android N update !!!;;;;;This phone is made in china ;;;;;For the money,back in my days you would get a 2 inch screen phone with lame software and only VGA camera,no ram and no sd card storage with 4 gb storage.But now you get a great giant screen that looks like Samsung s8,nice fast entry level chipset and decent amount of ram. The future is here,where for 150$ you can get a 5'7 inch screen and not buttons.Like a nice cool looking back up device that you can lie and boast to people you got it for 400$+. P.S. Xioami,Lenovo and many companies offer better value for the money,but are not sexy looking like this one :P;;;;;Best Indian mobile to go for... lets support india... i can guarantee it will last more than the chinese mobile who only do publicity and are only found in the repairing stores...;;;;;the chipset is lousy the camera has too big an aperture mostly won't get any update after oreo Rather go for a redmi 4 or redmi note 4.;;;;;is this mobile support direct video calling without app;;;;;your guess proved 100% true. i just did not expect such a mammoth combination at this dirt chip price. micromax rocks. i love it. waiting for infinity pro and pro s. ;;;;;Looks to me that every designer had a Samsung galaxy 8 on their table and all over the office to get inspiration from...;;;;;Lava is pure Indian company;;;;;Anyone talking Garbage about this phone is an Idiot wow just Wow Nokia 3 priced $153 becomes a better phone then this !!!??? Just wondering it has got just 8mp camera Garbage MT6737 and not an infinity display heck it even doesn't have fingerprint scanner !!! Not just that even this phone comes with 3/32 variant at the same price of Nokia !!! You're bashing this phone seriously ??? 2980mAh battery is less for an HD+ display and budget SD425 chipset ? But 3000 mAh battery for an QHD+ display and flagship SD835 processor is enough !!! You're drunk guys !!!;;;;;great step to compete against the other companies.. but  micromax is looking failed to understand the feeling and choice of users.big screen but battery is not good,battery should be atleast 4000 mah or more.front camera should have flash.fast charging is also lacking..but one good thing is there that we can remove battery..so micromax should provide Big battery for this smartphone.otherwise in this price range other smatphones also available with great features.only bazzleless screen and big screen is not enough;;;;;Micromax is now innovative and also doing some new thing Xiomi is not innovating any thing its just improving specification;;;;;I agree with u;;;;;Sd 425 procceser is not enough for this 5.7 inch phone. I dont like lithion ion battery bcos  it may blast later. This phone cant play 1080p games bcos of sd425.  They should hv  give dual led for rear camera. There is no  Gorilla glass like protection. There is no gyro sensor. They hv used unknown camera sensors for camera.... So I dont aspect quality camera pics/videos. ;;;;;Is volte support with lte 4g network .;;;;;Hello micromax is the third company to bring such display throughout the world. It is not a copy device and it cant be because Chinese phones except Xiaomi dont go towards innovation and we should be happy that micromax has done something very good. The best thing about this phone is that it will get Android Oreo update and the Micromax team also showed also compatible photos of Android oreo with the device and this means it could be launched soon.Micromax is also changing its habit and they started rolling out Android update for Yu yureka and trust me their service centres are more in number than Chinese phones and even better than them;;;;;2980 mAh in 5,7 inch screen that not infinite but definite thumbs down ;;;;;What about these other ones like Lava , Gionee, are these no Chinese org;;;;;I ll say its a great deal for them who loves to use  1.Big screen mobiles 2. Takes too much selfies 3. Want to use bezel less mobiles BUT their BUDGET is low,especially for teen girls.. I m not a big fan of micromax but i would say ALL D BEST to compete against chinese phones in the indian market at a time when indians are boycotting chinese products.;;;;;S8 has 3000 mah;;;;;think 2018 Edge Screen will be trend even for a mid-range phone;;;;;1.Screen is too large! which becomes a problem while holding it. 2.Poor batter backup because screen is 5.7 inch. 3.Old chipset. 4.2gb RAM could be enough if they had given better chipset like snapdragon 625. Instead giving more RAM. ;;;;;#Panorama not availeble in this #Phone #battery backup is Low so I am not satisfide this Phone;;;;;Pls add more money and buy Mi Max 2..;;;;;High rated;;;;;I guess you're mistaken bro almost all the popular Micromax and YU models are tested by NDTV Gadgets 360 thoroughly checkout Reviews of Micromax Dual 5 Micromax Evok Power YU Yureka Black Micromax Canvas 2 Micromax Canvas Infinity !!!;;;;;Great phone under rs 10000 quad core prosser can handle general use if display resolution have more PPI the phone could become greatest among great;;;;;V.small battery for 5.7 inch big display ;;;;;Those who think micromax is rebranding chinese phone should understand that every phone from any manufacturer is having more or less same tech.specification , evey time taunting microwave will not help.  Now, Micromaxs fault/mistake is that not a single phone from micromax is reviewed by either GSM Arena or NDTV or Phone Arena or any other testing authority so people or even micromax doesn't know what are plus points or minus points of their phone as it seems that micromax is not sending their phones for thorough review.;;;;;Yes, it has VoLTE support and will work with Jio in India.;;;;;Mmx kindly tell which foreign mobile phone model they've copied this time...?  Your own developers team is not efficient to create a design for you,  Worst thing is poor build quality in all your handsets and I'm very much confident that you're selling a mule this time whose name is infinity;;;;;Except usa all the mentioned countries are third world countries. Countries of asia, africa, south America are called third world countries.;;;;;Nice smartphone at a decent price under 10k people commenting here should realise that it is a bezel less full view display phone at 9999 &#8377;.

Micromax,Selfie 2 Q4311,";;;;;Getting automatic screen lock issue. While playing any game, suddenly game freezes and after 4-5 seconds screen locks automatically.  Being particular at first it happened with ""asphalt 8"" with high graphics setting, then I changed it to medium graphics, but still it was of no good. At first I thought being a heavy game might be the reason {what the hell 3GB RAM doing there if it cannot hold such game}. I've already played asphalt 8 on ""YU Yureka Plus"" with 2GB RAM, and it ran very smooth even with high graphics setting, processor was different though. But later when I was playing a 100MB game {limbo} and again repeatedly game freezed and screen locked. So, being heavy game has nothing to do with it. Looks like some software bug.
