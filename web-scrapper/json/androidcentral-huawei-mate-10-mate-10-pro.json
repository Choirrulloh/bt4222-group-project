[{"title": "Mate 10 Pro audio through the included dongle?", "thread": [{"postID": "post6196284", "text": "So there's a new video  \nup from PocketNow where Jaime Rivera talks about the Mate 10 Pro. He basically says that he loves the phone, but mentions that the audio through the dongle is \"bad\". Is this true, and if so, what's bad about it? Does it sound overall flat, or get distorted at higher volumes? Can the same be said about the headphone jack? I listen to music a lot, so I'd like to have great sounding headphone audio on my next phone, but I'm having a hard time choosing between the LG V30, HTC U11+ (or 12+), S9+ with Dolby Atmos, or Mate 10 Pro. The Mate is on my list for the apparent phenomenal battery life, obviously, which is another important thing on my list. Incidentally, I have heard that other dongles like the one included with the Razer phone are compatible with the Pro, and that one in particular is a great one. Any thoughts on this?\nI also have difficulty deciding between the regular Mate 10 and the Pro. I like the idea of having a fingerprint scanner on the front for navigation and the ability to use the phone on a desk, but besides that and the headphone jack, I'm a bit wary of the LCD screen as opposed to AMOLED. Although the effect on overall battery endurance is probably marginal, there is a difference between the two, according to GSMArena's review. Plus, coming from a Nexus 6P, having a phone with a water-resistance and a screen I can actually see at max brightness in direct sunlight is appealing. If only Huawei had made ONE phone without such curious compromises...

My father has a Mate 9, so I have very little experience with EMUI, other than setting the phone up for him. Visually, it's an obvious copy of iOS, which I actually don't mind. In fact, I prefer the EMUI/ iOS folder icons, that allow you to view nine apps per folder. To me, it's a much cleaner look. But aside from that, what are the things you like and dislike about EMUI?

I'm trying to figure out what they were trying to achieve here as you just trade a wide viewing experience to that of one that is way too narrow. What's even worse is a lot of companies are making this a trend that I think won't last but a couple of years. There is no way I would shell out big money for another 18.9 ratio phone again. Stick with what's best which is the symetrical 16.9 ratio that gives you the most proportioned viewing experience. I have no clue still seeing what the major advantage of a 18.9 ratio is exactly when all they are doing is taking away from the width and making the phone skinny and taller. It just does not make any logical sense to me to make a 18.9 ratio screen size. You actually loose screen real estate in the awkward ratio aspect.

I go through heaps of phones because I like trying new and different things. I had the Huawei P10 after my S8 and before my current Note 8 which I'm just about to trade in for the Mate 10 Pro. Samsung are well known for throwing every feature possible into TouchWiz/Samsung Experience and depending on your usage you may find EMUI a little restrictive in places. I say it's somewhere in the middle between iOS and TouchWiz. Battery optimisation is quite aggressive so it takes a little getting used to having to go find and turn on a lot of notifications and background process settings that they turn off by default to save battery. Once you get used to its little quirks though it's awesome and there's quite a lot of features they have that you won't find on many other phones like screen recording and knuckle gestures etc. I read and watched a lot of reviews before I got my Huawei P10 last year and I'm so glad I ignored the many negative opinions of EMUI and tried it for myself because it's the first phone in a long time I've actually kept longer than 6 months and could have comfortably kept it a bit longer too.\nIf you think you might be waiting for the S9 then personally I'd probably wait for that as it looks like it's gonna be an amazing phone and I'll almost definitely be getting one too but if you're bored with Galaxy's and eager to try something different then I doubt you'll be dissapointed", "time": "02-18-2018 12:20 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6165946", "text": "Thanks for the heads up.

The overly aggressive battery optimization kills email and similar apps that need to run continuously, it kills notifications for smartwatch, etc., it kills the updating of widgets, and that is all after allowing those apps to run in the background without battery optimization. It is bad enough where it does not even let its own always on display work properly if the phone is not used regularly. The time does not keep up. If the phone is in a dark place (pocket, etc.) for very long, it is very hard to wake it up. The notifications are all messed up, with fonts that are so big that the information spills outside the notification. Again, it cannot be adjusted. You can change the dpi if you go into developer options, but it does not help the notification font. Also, the dpi resets to a default setting, as does the display brightness, every time the phone is rebooted. All of these issues make the phone unreliable and unusable. As I said, the hardware is among the best out there, but it does not matter if the software messes it all up. I am hopeful, but doubtful, that the US version will have updated software that fixes these issues. I know it will not be released by the carriers, but there is no way AT&T or Verizon would have allowed such buggy software to be released on their phones. If the problems are not addressed, I will have to return mine. I will also have to use another phone until the US versions are released and I can see what software is on them.

The Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro are on my short list, but I have a few questions about both for those of you that have one or the other. I'd appreciate some honest feedback. For informational purposes, I'm a female with smaller hands.\nFirst, I stream my music often on Google Play Music, and I listen through earbuds (with a mic, of course). How is the audio quality through the headphone jack on the Mate 10 / dongle on the 10 Pro? Is it comparable to the quad DAC on the LG V30 or HTC's BoomSound? In truth, BoomSound is my favorite audio implementation. Even with my current 32 ohm impedance earbuds, the sound quality is fantastic. By contrast, when I tested my earbuds on the V30, there was no difference in the sound, whether the DAC setting was togged on or off. Apparently, the quad DAC on the V30 is triggered on by a headset of at least 50 ohm impedance, as shown in [this video](\n\n). Do any of you have eperience with these phones that can compare the quality of sound on the Mate 10?\nSecond, how is the battery life and standby time on the Mate 10 with the LCD screen? I've only used phones with AMOLED screens, and even though LCDs give more realistic colors, I'm concerned that they're more power-hungry than AMOLED, due to the fact that LCD uses backlight, where all pixels are lit up. Is there a discernible difference between the two? I don't consider myself a heavy user, really. All I do is talk, text, stream my music, occasionally browse the web, watch YouTube videos, and visit forums. I don't do anything graphic intensive like gaming, nor am I big into photography, other than the occasional point-and-shoot. As such, excellent standby is a must.\nThird, how is the screen visibility in outdoor light, especially in direct sunlight? My major gripe with the 6P is that visibility of the screen in direct sun is NIL. No amount of squinting or cupping my hand over the screen helps. So which of the two Mate 10's has the better screen?\nI will admit that although the fingerprint scanner on my 6P is on the back and in a natural position for my finger to rest, the prospect of a front scanner where I don't have to constantly pick up the phone to unlock it is intriguing.\nAs far as EMUI goes, I can readily admit to it being somewhat of a rip off of iOS, but since I don't hate Apple, and I actually like and prefer the look of the 9 apps in each folder, I don't mind. Yeah, it's probably me being picky, but I hate only being able to see 4 apps in a folder. The EMUI iOS-like folder setup just looks cleaner and more organized to me.\nMy best friend keeps telling me I should just go for the Note 8, but I haven't had a Samsung phone since the S3. TouchWiz, Samsung Experience, or whatever they're calling it now scares me. The sad part is, though, when it comes to accessories, Apple and Samsung get the most support in the way of choices, as well as the ability to take either phone to any local shop and know you can have it repaired without a lot of hassle. But I've never been one to follow the herd.\nAnyway, what do all of you think? Apologies for the long-winded post, but I don't take spending $1000+ when all is said and done lightly. I'd like to make as informed a decision and purchase as I can.

Not very convenient though if you just want to quickly check the time and the phone is on a flat surface.\n- As a result of the above, I have turned on AOD. This is tucked away in settings and you have to search for it (as far as I'm aware)\n- Notifications are a bit of a conundrum, they disappear when you unlock the phone and then lock it again despite not reading them. I'd still expect some form of notification to display to remind me I still have unread notifications.\n- The notification light is very small and often difficult notice when it's flashing.\n- Call and notification volume are linked so you cannot alter these 2 separately without the use of a third party app.\n- My biggest qualm at the minute is trying to swipe down. This could just be me and it will no doubt improve over time but I am often finding that when I swipe down, unless I'm really concentrating to make a perfect vertical swipe, it often mistakes it for a side swipe. Furthermore, when trying to swipe down to view your notifications, unless you are literally swiping down from the top of the screen, it mistakes this swipe for another which takes you into a search for settings screen, this is extremely frustrating.\nI does sound like I'm really hammering the phone to be fair but these are all minor issues and could be completely irrelevant for other users, I had a few teething problems on my Nexus 6P when I first got that and grew to love it. Apart from the above points it really does seem to be a great phone, hopefully some of the points I've been mentioned could be ironed out in a software update as well.\nAnyway, sorry for rambling on...just wanted to hear thoughts from anyone else who has the phone and see if they're experiencing any of the same issues?\nCheers", "time": "11-20-2017 10:17 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6078647", "text": "The notification disappearing thing is apparently common across multiple Huawei phones.

Was pretty impressed with it and went on to get the P10 too. So naturally, interested to try the Mate 10 pro too.\nFor me no SD card and 3.5mm isn't a deal breaker since i'm on mostly cloud and wireless earphones. Then it has Ip67 too. Which is why I chose the pro instead.\nThe screen is really good as expected from Huawei. The resolution is a bit lower compare to mate 10 or like the S8+, V30, but it's good enough looking. nice colours, contrast, outdoor visibility. The tradeoff is probably worth it since I value battery life more.\nPerformance is really good. But not sure if it's just Oreo being too new, the software doesn't seem as polished and smooth as the Mate 9. So might take a few updates to get up to speed. But of course still hard to match Pixel 2's fluidity. Huawei's chipset has been impressive in my time with it, with great gaming performance from the Mali GPU. Last year's Mate 9 had one of the best gaming performance on an Android phone. It doesn't feel any better, but it's still great.\nBattery life is great too as you would expect from 4000mAh and FHD screen. Easily last me through a day of heavy use, and maybe a bit more the next day. Definitely no complaints here. And impressive how they squeezed in a much larger battery in a phone smaller than the Pixel 2XL.\nBefore you say the stereos speakers, yes, the Pixel 2 XL is probably louder, but the Mate 10 Pro is no slouch too. it uses the call speaker to supplement bottom speaker too and sounds great still.\nCamera wise is going to be really subjective. The image processing is more contrast-y, more textures, going for a more artistic flair? Kinda like Leica's cameras? It's certainly different from what we typically considered good like the higher dynamic range, sharpened images from Samsung, Google, or Apple. I think it looks artsy and nice, and the monochrome mode is definitely fun to shoot with. Overall I like the camera experience here. But I definitely wouldn't blame you for not liking it.\nSounds great so far? here comes the not so great stuff. EMUI. It's not just because i like stock android, but it's because I think the design is all over the place. Samsung on the other hand has cleaned up their act and placed a lot of effort at making their design work, and on the S8 it looks nice actually.\nSo yeah. Great hardware, maybe less great software. So while this phone isn't at the top of my recommendations list, I wouldn't stop anyone from buying one either if they really like how it looks. And the midnight blue version that I have, really looks darn good.", "time": "11-25-2017 08:14 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6091065", "text": "Nice review, a bit sad to hear that emui still isn't streamlined though", "time": "11-30-2017 01:24 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6091175", "text": "With regards to the Samsung skin, it does lag over time.
