I then went to Best Buy to look at their display model and saw that the display model had the setting in the Messages app to switch to group messaging. This confirmed my research that some phones had that setting in Messages while others did not, the difference apparently attributed to whether the phone was the U.S. version or the international version.\nIt was suggested to those who had the problem to switch to another messaging app and I did so, switching to Textra.
