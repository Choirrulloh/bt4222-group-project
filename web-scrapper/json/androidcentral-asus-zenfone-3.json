If the ZF3 still had the lightweight back with dual sim and simultaneous microSDXC and removal battery I think it would be most appealing for many consumers.\nI am okay with a little bloatware, especially if they are relatively simple and fundamental apps; like the FM radio tuner, photo gallery viewer, contacts, etc. A few good choices could provider a better out-of-the-box experience for the first time buyer or someone who lives in a place with slow or spotty internet connections. I don't mind moving the unused Apps over to some corner of the phone as long as they don't take up too much space or run.\nI would also like faster Android updates, but having the latest is not so critical since most of the interaction is with individual apps. I prefer software stability and performance more than any flashy OS feature.\nI have been considering higher end phones such as the ZTE Axon 7, OnePlus 3 and lower end ones like the Moto G4. If the Axon 7 included a FM radio or the OnePlus 3 supported mircoSD they would probably win out but since they do not I am back to looking at the ZF3 but due to past issues and glass case I may ultimately go with the Moto G4 (Plus or non-Plus).

Like the earlier post, this post revolves around Zenfone 3, too! A camera enthusiast, I'd like to talk about the device's key camera features, which I believe really stands out. Not sure, how many of you would agree with me, but just a perspective! \nBefore I could go ahead with the device's camera details, let me introduce you to the basics of Photography! \nHow we should ideally shoot a photo: Look or select a subject of our choice, compose a good frame, focus over the subject, and finally control and balance the shutter speed and aperture, following which you could shoot! FYI, this is just the little we can see and witness on the out, but there's so much happening on the inside while we begin to shoot the picture. Let me take you through something that you may have probably missed out on:\nThe very second you press over the shutter button , not only would it open up but would also let in light, as per the shutter speed given. Whatever however happens during this process is that even the slightest shake or blur would result into a blurry image. Here's how the blur takes place: When you click the shutter button, the shutter immediately lets in light, during this process, the slightest shake will hamper the shutter from the process and will therefore deliver a blurry image.OIS (Optical Image Stabilization)\nIn situations, such as mentioned above, the only solution to such blurry images is OIS. The Zenfone 3 fortunately comes with OIS, how awesome is this right? Although, before we could begin understanding the working of OIS, let's understand how the shutter speed works.\nI often look at the Shutter Speed as a mouth that opens and closes as per the speed assigned by the person. In other words, higher the shutter speed, the less light it would let in. When you shoot with a high shutter speed, you would not end up with a blurry image. However, when it comes to a low shutter speed, because the shutter stays open for long, it lets in more light and therefore increases the chance of a shaky image. \nMoving on, Let's now understand how the OIS works:\nWhat's the Role of OIS and how it could better your Zenfone 3 Camera Experience?\nLet's admit the fact that we're human are bound to error, especially when it comes to the camera. We cannot always control or shake unless we make use of a super stable platform or tripod to shoot. However, OIS in such situations could help rescue a shaky image. If you're wondering how, little help you with this bit: OIS works through something called gyroscopic sensors that are seen within the lens. The main function of the gyroscopic sensor is to sense if the image and sensor aren't aligned as it should. \nWhat the OIS system does is that it further makes use of two gyros within the lens, usually for Pitch(camera rotation from left to right) and Yaw(Up and down movement). \nHere's a little demonstration I picked up from one of the ASUS write ups. \nAs you can see in the image above, both images have been tested with the OIS and without. You'll be able to tell the difference\nHere's an additional demonstration to help you understand how OIS works! (Video clip picked from an ASUS related article) EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization)\nIf however, you're someone who loves working with videos, like I do, sometimes, the Zenfone 3 still makes a good choice. Based on my hands on with the phone, I can personally say that it's great with videos. This is because the device comes with the EIS feature. \nHere's how Zenfone 3 would better your video experience: \nUnless you've got real steady hands or own a tripod, you're going to end up with shaky videos. \nThis is when the EIS function comes handy. Through the help of a light sensing chip, the EIS system reduce possible shakes or moves. Just for your knowledge, Videos are actually made up of endless images that come together and make a video. Once the image makes its way to the chip and if a camera shake is detected through the sensors and is comprehended by the system, it responds immediately by moving the image accordingly. Example: If the camera shakes towards the right during a pan or otherwise, the system will eliminate or correct this shake by moving it to the left.\nHere's a small demo to help you understand the stability seen through EIS in videos:", "time": "09-02-2016 05:34 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5649604", "text": "Hello.\nFor photographs wat is the best: Huawei Nova (not Plus) or the Asus Zenfone 3 ZE520KL ?", "time": "01-19-2017 02:33 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5670647", "text": "Very nice write up, please let us know how the phone is holding up.\nThank You", "time": "02-07-2017 02:10 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Is the ZE552KL compatible with Freedom (WIND) Mobile?", "thread": [{"postID": "post5597619", "text": "So, my shiny new ZenFone 3 came in today, and I'm having issues connecting to Wind Mobile (now known as Freedom Mobile) up in Canada.

I can proudly say this- having tried and tested the phone. It's amazingly good! \nEvery time I shoot a video through the Zenfone 3, I always associate it to luxury. Here's why: The device supports 4k Video recording and tags along optical image stabilizers and electronic image stabilizers. These stabilizers ensure shake-free photos and videos. \nIf you're however not familiar with the term 4K, the below write up explains it:\nPixels that are also recognized as tiny dots of light, work together to complete a given video you ideally watch on your screen. In order to view perfect 4K Videos, the phone display works around 4,000 pixels around the screen area and 2,160 pixels in the vertical pattern. Amazing right?\nIf we compare 4K with a Television set, common Television sets (not those high end expensive sets) deliver about 1080p HD TV, while 4K through smartphones deliver up to 2160p. This would mean that 4K videos deliver nothing but clear and sharp images, four times the amount of pixel when compared to a common television set. Hope it's not too confusing, I tried breaking it down for you! \nThis may come as a surprise to you but 4K isn't actually new! 4K has been out and alive ever since 2003. No sooner, did it come to cinema in the year 2011. Fortunately for us, it soon came to home theatres till 2012.\nIt's good to see Zenfone 3 with 4K honestly, given the fact that just a few devices in the market tag along this super cool feature. \nIf you're thinking of buying the Zenfone 3, in all honesty, I'd recommend the buy. Let's consider a few advantages of the 4k display that I've personally come across:\n1. Stabilizes shaky videos\n2. You could expect to capture sharp images and videos\n3. Don't bother about blurred pics especially through a zoom\nThe big question however revolves around the device being able to accommodate such high end videos. I'd say, the Zenfone 3 would be able to accommodate, our opinions would however differ. \nA one second video for example would require a good 11MB space while a 10 minute would require 7GB. Considering these, the Zenfone 3 comes with an inbuilt storage of 32GB. I think if you backup your data regularly, you shouldn't face storage space issues. What's even better, the Zenfone 3 Deluxe and Ultra come with a good 64GB space. \nI'd reckon that there's ample amount of space, that Zenfone 3 offers.
