It was also my first smartphone, so I'm relatively unbiased. I'd give it a solid 6.5-7/10. I removed a point for every major fault and a half point for a minor fault. \n \r\nOne major issue, of course, is the bootloop. To my knowledge it was caused by a faulty contact on the motherboard. Took a week to replace, but to their credit it was out of warranty. -1 for that. \n \r\nThe battery life is pretty atrocious and erratic. There have been days where I got 5+ hours of screen on time, and others when I got 1.5-2. You might chalk it up to variations in daily usage, but I pretty much use it for the same things every day. Mostly Messenger (only messenger, facebook app disabled), Snapchat, texting, some web browsing, maybe 10-20 min of youtube videos, 5-10 min of light gaming. Not too heavy, but not light either. Still, other phones do much better consistently in this regard. At times the battery would randomly start draining rapidly even when I hadn't touched the phone in hours. -1 to -1.5 for that, depending on how important it is to you. Classes end around 3-4 for me, by which time it would be at 5-10% battery, so I would just recharge. Keep in mind that it does support QuickCharge, so charging is quite fast.\n \r\nIn addition, LG will not be updating the phone past Android 6.0, which basically forces me to upgrade soon. This doesn't really bother me too much though, since in my day to day usage, I don't feel like I'm lacking any features, so -0.5.\n \r\nThe last minor issue is occasional slow downs/freezes. Doesn't happen very often, maybe once every few weeks; it is annoying when it happens though, so -0.5 for that.\n \r\nOther than that, the phone is pretty much perfect, both in size and quality. The screen is fantastic, and very high resolution. It is an LCD, which you may or may not prefer over OLED. IMO the colors look very natural. I'm not a huge fan of oversaturation, although I haven't owned an OLED phone before. The Android skin is very light and quite similar to stock. Every day actions are buttery smooth, with no random lags or hitches. The camera is very good, and has lots of manual options. I really like the build of the phone. The bezels are the right size, and the back has a nice texture for a plastic back. The front side really is beautiful. It is also quite durable. I had an Otterbox on it for a while, but I took it off a few months ago because I got sick of it.

It feels comfortable in your hand and it doesn\u00b4t feel like an 5.5 inche screen phone at all. \r\nAlso it supports fast charge which is usefull\n \r\nDownsides: \r\nIt\u00b4s made of plastic ( although it improoves massively with proper leather back cover)\n \r\nSo So batery (it will last one day so they say) but at least you can have one spare\n \r\nThe S6 has an 5.1 inch secreen but it\u00b4s amoled, and faster processor.

Yes folks yhrre is nothong you can do bar find a programme online that does not do this.  The G4 underexposes highlights and overexposes shadows as you pan creating surreal results you might just like. But this should be your choice. Here it is forced upon you.

You are helpless as tho u can use raw for stills you have rubbish panoramas that cannot compare to an S6 edge for quality on good light because S6 machines have a LOT less sharpening. \r\nVideo is automaydd and has same quality as jpegs. Why do all ghe extra destructive processing at all?

After about just enough time for the original representative has had enough time to tell the next person who gets on the line what he has told me She gets really nasty and tells me there is nothing she can do and wants to know if there's anything else she can do for me. Needless to say I told her no and hung up.\n \r\nFast forward to today:\n \r\nRealizing that these people have absolutely no comprehension of what customer service is I just decide to go ahead and purchase a new one from LG since only original equipment will work with the quick charge feature in the phone, so I go to LGs website with the intention of ordering one. After quite awhile I finally find the parts ordering page and try to order and pay for one. At this point the website tells me that they do not sell this cord and gives me the phone number to their parts distributer who promptly informs me that they don't stock that part and that I need to order it from LG, the people who just told me that they don't stock it.\n \r\nSo here I go back on the phone with what I now refer to LG's lack of service service department and once again request to speak to a supervisor. This turns out to be the nastiest person that I have ever had to deal with in my life! When I tell him that I would like to speak to his supervisor he tells me that he is it and there is nobody above him for me to talk to. Being relatively certain that this obnoxious man is not the CEO or president of LG and when I asked him if he was he lost it and started to scream and curse at me. So ended that conversation.\n \r\nI have just got off the phone with Verizon who has provided me with some contact information at the LG Corporate Headquarters in the USA and am hoping they return my call after leaving the corporate level customer service head honchos a message. The only bright spot in this whole fiasco is that Verizon informed me that while it is not original LG equipment they now carry a replacement cord which they have tested and it does conform to the requirements for fast charging and they are sending me one free of charge.  \n \r\nStay tuned.\n", "date": "03 Nov 2015"}, {"text": "plz help :( \r\ngot lg g4 20 days before ,,, now my touch works automatically some time, uper left corner,,  \r\npls ans me in detail its hardwear issue or softwear ,,   ???? \r\nsory for my bad english", "date": "03 Nov 2015"}, {"text": "I am still hoping to see an LG future flagship with the 5.2\" screen, but not taller than 138mm i.e. similar height as in LG G2.

WINNER: M5\n \r\nCamera: M5's main cam is 21MP while the front cam is 13MP but that does not necessarily mean it produces the best picture IMO taking 21mp photos is not wise since it will eat up your phone's storage and uploading it would take so long. I tried the M5's 13MP front cam and if you love taking selfies I don't think 13MP is something you'd go for since it literally shows every imperfection on your face. On the other hand, LG G4 has lower aperture, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it produces better lowlight picture. In my own experience, lowlight shots of G4 are a bit noisy, You may want to take advantage of the special DSLR-like Manual mode to adjust shutter speed and other settings to produce the best photo possible. WINNER: Depends on your camera usage.\n \r\nDisplay: Personally I'm not a fan of M5's screen display. Compared to smartphones nowadays the screen size of 5\" is somehow small. Plus the brightness is not something I like given the dull UI of Xperia phones. I haven't seen LG G4 in full brightness setting but the UI of LG has rich colors which I like. Xperia's UI looks very neat but a bit complicated to use if it's your 1st time having a sony phone since it doesn't seem to be a cliche android looking phone.\n \r\nPhysical Appearance: Unlike M5 and most smartphones , G4's back cover is still detachable which allows you to replace the battery easily if you'll have a problem with it in the future. M5's overall appearance looks very simple and neat w/o a case but doesn't feel expensive since it's not made much out of metal. Putting case on the phone makes you think it's the premium Z series since the front looks the same, except the front camera. On the other hand go for G4 if you want the leather for a more sophisticated look. Just make sure you take care of the leather. So far feedbacks are good regarding the leather cover.\n \r\nWater resistance: M5 is well known for being water resistant but even the site claims that the phone can NOT be used underwater unlike some early xperia phones. If that's the case I think G4 can also manage some spilling of liquid as long as it's in the front part of the phone. Just make sure the speaker and the edges don't get wet to avoid damaging the inside and the sensors.\n \r\nHope this helps you.", "date": "16 Oct 2015"}, {"text": "Hi guys, \r\ni am very confused about, is it LG g4 Dual is realeased? \r\nHas it  same features of LGg4 single sim.?? \r\nI went so many shop in Germany.but they don\u00b4t have LGg4 dual sim phone.\n\n \r\nThank you, \r\nHave nice day.", "date": "16 Oct 2015"}, {"text": "So should I go for G4 or wait for next year G5?", "date": "16 Oct 2015"}, {"text": "Confused between LG G4 - Xperia Z3+ - Oneplus 2 - Moto X Style\n\n \r\ncan anyone please help me to choose a good one\n \r\nwhich one is best in all aspects performance service features??\n", "date": "16 Oct 2015"}, {"text": "Totally LG G4 , I've had it for almost 3 months already and I have yet to encounter a problem with it.

I own a G4, I am coming from a Samsung and I'm not a fanboy, I am looking for what best suits my needs. Tell me do you find the other flagships better? The Galaxy S6 is closest in terms of functionality and quality and what? It has reportedly terrible battery life. Other phones have 1080p displays like the Sony flagships before Z5 and still are only slightly better. Bear in mind that Chinese cheep flagship killers are not available everywhere in the world, so we are talking about the worldwide selling brands only.

You want it 5,5 inch but to be as small and light as possible? You want it with replaceable battery? You want external SD? You want 3000+ mAh battery? You can choose only few of all this in one device, because that's how far technology goes - some of these options are incompatible with each other. That's why you search for a phone that suits your needs. Flagships are phones full of compromises that are hidden behind gimmicky options that are just dust to the eyes. Some flagships are more balanced like the G4, others are strong in one or two things and weak in another things. You can't have it all.

If a phone is going to be sealed with a non-removable battery then it needs to be waterproof but since neither the Samsung nor the LG is waterproof this was a deciding factor.

That coupled with the fact that the G4 is a overall bigger phone (easier for my big hands) and having a removable/replaceable battery just strengthens my decision.\n \r\nUltimately I chose the G4 and couldnt be happier with my choice. The phone with its premium leather back feels of such high quality, some will say \"but the S6 comes with a glass back\" but I have experienced this with my various Xperia models and with the amount of fingerprints that feature on the rear of the phone coupled with all the scratches that the glass receives from placing it on various surfaces to me its of no use whatsoever, and the G4 I can chop and change my back covers to suite my style and mood without problem.\n \r\nWould I recommend the G4 absolutely, \"but the Samsung S6 has wireless charging\", with a $7 pad I bought off ebay so now does my G4, a minor in comparison to the overall price difference between the G4 and S6.  \r\nThank you LG for doing it right.", "date": "03 Aug 2015"}, {"text": "do you compare daekness reborn game on iphone 5s or ipad mini retina vs high end android devices? &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;&#128\u00ad514;", "date": "03 Aug 2015"}, {"text": "Absolutely love the camera on this phone, it's better than our SLR.

The display is brilliant like the iPhone's display and better than the Blackberry's or the HTC.

I find the keyboard on the Blackberry Z30 (and Z10) just way smoother, and second would be the iPhone. The processor is very smooth on the G4 just like the HTC but Youtube tends to lag a bit nothing bad at all just a few like lags... The Blackberry browser is the best, second I would say Safari, followed by Chrome. The HTC seemed to be the more dominant processor much smoother.

Its slightly taller than the G3, and when held side by side it makes the G3 look a bit chubby. \n \r\nThe screen is one of the standout feature for me, a watch a lot of videos on my phone, and have never used a better screen for media. Videos and pictures alike are crisp and vivid.\n \r\nThe second feature i would deem to be standout is the rear camera. I'm not a great photographer, so all of the manual features it has are admittedly wasted on me, and when i did try and use them i found the amount of settings a little daunting, but the auto settings take fantastic shots on the fly, with a burst mode built in. \n \r\nI found the UI to be slicker than on the G3, and while before the G3 I'd steered clear of phones running anything other than vanilla android, i found the G3 a nice surprise, until the Android 5.0 update at least. \r\nThe UI on the G4 seems like a refinement of this, and now seems to have no issues running Android 5+.\n \r\nAs with the G3, im a huge fan of the removable battery storage and back. I carry a spare battery around with me, and have a 32gb sd card i use for media. My only issue with this was that the stock, grey back that came with the phone was too smooth, but this is easily remedied with a cover or changing the back plate,(i plan on getting a leather one).\n \r\nTL:DR \r\nIn all this is probably the best android phone I've had to date, the camera and screen are fantastic, the battery life is better than the last few phones I've had by quite a way, and the UI is very slick", "date": "24 Jun 2015"}, {"text": "Yes it has good features like camera sd card slot and large screen.", "date": "24 Jun 2015"}, {"text": "Sure, they really didn't pack much into their G4 especially when it's up against the formidable S6, which is a solid device through and through.

", "date": "14 Jun 2015"}, {"text": "Hello Everyone!\n \r\nI bought this phone and have been using it for more than 2 weeks now. My original plan was to wait for the 2015 Nexus 5 (My dream phone) but then i can't wait, and the G4 was available so i got this one instead. Here's my review.\n \r\nDesign/Size: \r\nI got the black leather for the back cover, and it looks and feels really, really, really nice. It has a harder material compared to the red and brown one, which feels more leathery. I have been reading that some have bought their phones with an extra back cover. I wonder why that is not the same in my country. :( My only problem with the back panel which i did not realize before, is that it's very annoying to use it on a table because it's curved. The front panel is very simple and looks boring when the screen is off. \r\nThe size is a bit bigger for me. It's hard to text in one hand, but possible, there is an option in the settings to help you with this. I would prefer 4.8 to 5.2 inches phone - Nexus 5 :(\n\n \r\nInterface: \r\nWell, this is my first android, i had a windows phone and an ipad, so i know what a smooth interface looks like. well, the first days the G4 runs very smoothly, the swipe is all like butter. but after a week, after i have installed most of the apps. i am experiencing some lags especially in the home screen after i have unlocked it from the lock screen. it's not a major lag guys, just a bit of stuttering, but like what i said, i have been using windows phone and an ipad and both really runs almost perfectly smooth, so i can't help to compare. And I am not sure if this natural in android phones. I hope someone could enlighten me about this. Anyway, about the apps, they work perfectly fine. I am playing a lot of ufc and asphalt and the games run very nice without problems.\n \r\nBattery: \r\nNot very good. not very bad. the first few days, since i have been setting up my phone, always downloading apps, it will only last for like to 6 hours. if i'm not using it a lot, it could last maximum of 20 hours. so basically i have to charge like 1.2 times a day. A good thing though is that they provided me with a free battery kit. it's very useful. but i am concerned if it is fine to always remove the back cover. and if it is healthy to the phone to only charge in the battery kit.\n \r\nDisplay: \r\nthe display is superb. better than my girlfriend's ip6+. but a bit worse than my friend's S6 edge. \n \r\nCamera: \r\nNow this is a winner. No doubt. The best I have ever experienced. If you are for the camera, go for this. This phone takes selfies like it's from the rear camera. and takes photos/vids using the rear one almost like it's a dslr cam.\n \r\nSoftware: \r\nAgain this is my first android, so i am loving the way i can customize everything. the LG software is good, but some apps seems useless but at least they're not forcing me to use them. and it's quite annoying that i need to choose which apps to use either from google or lg. I am already feeling regrets that i did not wait for the nexus 5.\n \r\nOther PROs: \r\n-nice earphones! \r\n-there is a free LG 32GB SD card. so having a 64GB is really awesome. \r\n-cheaper than other flagships\n \r\nI'm tired of typing so i need to end this. In summary, this phone is really a flagship and in competition with other smartphones. One of the best. I can't say it's best in all aspects but this phone is really worth the price.

In normal light it brings a great clear picture, and has manual mode with ISO, shutter and white balance settings to really play about with your picture. This camera really shines in low light. It brings out a crisp pictures and does it without making the picture look unnatural. Best camera out there.\n \r\nSecondly I wanted to go onto performance. It has no problems with daily use. I have even downloaded Modern Combat, Asphalt 8 and Mortal Kombat X to test the phone and it plays these games with ease.\n \r\nBattery life easily last me a day and thats with moderate/high use. That includes bluetooth to stream music to my car, phone calls, whatsapp, text messaging, social media and watching a few random YouTube videos a day. \n \r\nI currently have the grey metallic one and the phone generally has good ergonomics but I think the leather one will be the one to get as it has a more premium feel. \n \r\nIt has expandable memory, a decent speaker and good call quality as well so I can't complain about the phone.\n \r\nI am slightly old school and like stock Lollipop so I use Nova Launcher to make it look like stock. The actual LG software is very good and has a lot of tidy functions but changing the look is all off preference. \n \r\nOverall great phone and I would seriously recommend the phone.

G4 is much more bigger than s6. I guess S6 looks a little feminine. And S6 has better ap but I cant feel the difference of performance. Both of them run very fast. Maybe G4's OS is well oprimized. Quanterm IPS LCD is more bright and colorful than S6. S6 has good feature like finger scan and samsung pay and wireless charge but my wife doesnt use them. So dont know if they are good or not. About the Battery life, S6 is very poor. My wife isnt a heavy user but cant hold it a day without charge. And S6 sometimes show some overheat around camera in the back. But G4 doent show any heat until now and battery life is looks OK. Longer battery life is the reason why I chose G4. And about the camera, Im 100% sure that G4 is the best camera phone in the world. Picture quality of front and back are nice and colorful. Selfie is easy and fast. And Manual mode is really good if you have a little knowledge for camera. Even in the dark room, you can control iso and shutter speed and get bright picture or movie with nice quality. I really love it.

A smaller aperture will let more light into the shot, which equates to brighter and clearer images in poor lighting conditions. Even for DSLR camera lenses, an aperture of f/1.4 to 2.8 is a high-quality product.  \n \r\nAlso, the camera module receives enough light in short period of time so that the images will be less blurry. This is largely because one can reduce the time needed to hold the smartphone still when taking a photo. \n \r\nIn order to maximize the amount of light for image sensors, LG Innotek used a high-precision, large-diameter module structure. The company doubled the size of its lenses and increased the sensing layers to six. \n \r\nLG Innotek is also mass producing the 8 megapixel front-facing camera module, which is the highest among the front-facing cameras in the domestic market. \n \r\nThe product comes with a 0.11 mm ultra-thin glass blue filter. The blue filter ensures natural and accurate expression of color by keeping infrared rays from entering the camera lens and increasing the penetration of visible rays.\n \r\n- See more at:  ", "date": "15 Apr 2015"}, {"text": "i agree to you. g4 is a great phone and  has the perfect size. not too big like iphone6+ or nexus 6 and not too smalle like iphone4s or nexus4.", "date": "15 Apr 2015"}, {"text": "G4=5.55\" screen  \r\nG4 NOTE=5.9-6.0\" screen.\n \r\ndeal with it!", "date": "14 Apr 2015"}, {"text": "G4 is not a big phone for most people's standard today! \r\nim using note4 and i'm sure g4 is the perfect to me.\n \r\nbetter wake up apple has already woke  up and made even bigger iphone6. people before always say 4.7\" is a big phone. but now people hate small phone with small screen. atleast im representing majority today are using above 5\" screen on their phone. better deal with it!\n", "date": "14 Apr 2015"}, {"text": "quantum IPS QHD is better and more energy efficiency. \r\ng4 is more compact than note4 and for me its look very class and elegant fashion phone than note4. \r\nL GUI is better than Touchwiz and so on...\n\n", "date": "14 Apr 2015"}, {"text": "As i already sugested, LG could go ahead with bigger sized phones via note series, not G series. \r\nBy the way, i admire samsung note 4 specs, and i do not see any advantage  in specs of Lg G4 vs olde Note 4.

The advanced camera module began mass production at LG Innotek's plant this week and will be unveiled to consumers for the first time in the LG G4 later this month.\n \r\nThe advanced design of the camera module means that it receives 80 percent more light than in the highly praised camera found on the LG G3. More light means better looking images in low light environments and less blur when shooting action and fast moving objects. Large apertures on smartphone cameras has been challenging to develop due to the complexity and size of developing modules that must fit in the very limited space of today's smartphones.\n \r\nFurthermore, in response to the explosive growth of selfies, LG Innotek developed an 8MP front-facing camera module, its highest resolution for a front camera to date. This high resolution module's ultra-thin IR filter keeps infrared light from entering the camera lens, giving images taken with the front camera more natural and accurate colors. The 0.11mm thin filter is roughly half the thickness of competing IR filters.\n \r\n\"At LG Innotek, we are constantly working to ensure that the cameras we develop allow users to capture and preserve the moments that are most special to them,\" said Ung-beom Lee, CEO of LG Innotek. \"We are extremely excited to see our technology in LG's next flagship smartphone because we believe that the power, precision and operability of our camera module will clearly make an impression on consumers.\"", "date": "09 Apr 2015"}, {"text": "Does this g4 have a removable battery?
