I don't really play games on my phone aside from classic Pokemon.\n\r\nRAM in the G4 16gb is a little limited, as 2gb of ram I do start to notice some sluggish performance if I leave too many apps open. I don't use a whole lot of apps at once, so this doesn't bother me and I can just as easily close the apps out.\n\r\nCamera is pretty decent, takes decent shots and videos. That's all I ask for.\n\r\nBattery does get hot quick, have not found anything that can fix this but it's not an issue.\n\r\nThe lack of NFC I was not aware of until after I bought the phone.
