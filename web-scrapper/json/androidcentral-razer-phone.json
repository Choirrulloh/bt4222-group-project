I have a couple of concerns, but they might not be a factor for others.\n1) building a phone is hard.. well thats the easy part.. but building a phone, and supporting the hardware, and producing updates, and committing to get them out to people for a couple of years isn't easy. Especially if this is your first handset and you're learning as you go (see Nextbit, Essential, Wileyfox etc...) I'm not sure how long this is going to be supported.\n2) whilst the gaming performance is scoring well... the reviews have been disappointed by the camera performance.\n3) I'm really not a phone gamer... so i'm not the target audience.\nBut i'd be really interested in anyones opinion.

I have the essential phone, and absolutely love this phone. I was an early adopter and have stuck with it since release. They have been solid on adressing issues and when google drops the update every month essential has it in the next couple days. \nFor myself personally I don't care about the camera in a phone. Never have and frankly never will care about that. For those moments that I really want to remember I have a real camera that destroys the best of the best phone cameras. \nSeeing as Razer has established it's self with it's computers, they also unveiled project Linda. Which looks really interesting, the new companies are trying to make change.
