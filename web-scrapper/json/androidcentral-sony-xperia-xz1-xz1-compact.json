(Sony or Google, whoever is responsible for the SD card issues)\nI am doing research since yesterday like crazy, just took again a look on the Sony page,the following quote is about the XZ1, concerning \"Storage and memory\":\n\"Your device has several different storage and memory options:\nThe internal storage stores downloaded or transferred content along with personal settings and data.You can use a removable memory card to get more storage space. Media files can be moved to this type of memory to free up internal storage....\nYou can purchase a memory card separately.\nImproving memory performance\nIf the device starts to slow down, or applications suddenly shut down, you should consider the following:\nAlways try to keep at least 500 MB of free internal storage available. ....\n... Uninstall downloaded applications that you don't use.Transfer photos, videos and music from the internal memory to the memory card.\nIf your device can't read content on the memory card, you may need to format the card. Note that when you format the card, all content is erased.\nSo it says clearly NOTHING about moving APPs to the SD card! Hilarious, isn't it?\nThis is conflicting to the fact, after I enabled the developer options, then go down to \"Apps\", the \"option\": \"Force allow apps on external\". So what, on one hand Sony says, only media files can be transferred to SD, on the other we have the \"Force allow apps on external\", what is ANYWAY NOT working.

I will space it out appropriately.) I have had this phone for a week and have used it consistently as my phone for that time frame. \nThe tl;dr version (too long; didn't read):\n-Size is great and the display is fine for me\n-Battery life is excellent\n-Performance is great\n-Fingerprint sensor is fast\n-Sony's UI is light, even though there's a lot of addons\n-Cameras have improved this year on the software side but in low light situations, the picture can be yellowish\n-The stereo speakers sound so good\nOverall rating is 9 out of 10.\nAlright, on to my more detailed review:\nDesign & display\n-I love the size of this phone. It reminds me of the size of the iPhone SE which I do own, but a little bigger. To me, it's great for those of us who desire a small phone that is actually powerful and has a good amount of screen, which I will get to that point shortly.\n-This time around, Sony decided to put the volume rocker above the power button which is a great place. On the X Compact, it was below the power button, which was just a pain for me. The only quirky thing about this is that I find myself pressing it and then realizing that isn't the power button because of my other phones.\n-Almost forgot the concern about the corners that some people have. It's been fine for me, the corners don't feel sharp to me, and I have had no issues holding it and using it with the same hand. (I'm naturally thin so one would think if anyone would feel sharpness, it would be me.) Speaking of one hand usage, this is a perfect one hand use phone. Like the SE, you can reach all corners with one hand.\n-I haven't had any issues with the 720p display. It fits the phone. Also the LCD is pretty good.\n-The brightness has been fine to me. There's actually a setting that stops the screen from dimming once it senses that it is in your hand. For the most part, this has worked well. When it doesn't sense that it is fully there, you see the screen debating if it wants to go dim or stay lit. It doesn't bother me but it is noticeable.\n-Speaking of modes, there are three display modes. The default mode is not very saturated but there is a mode for that. I just hate that look so how it looks is fine for me. It doesn't look cold. Additionally there is a glove mode which is awesome to have when it gets cold.\nPerformance & battery life\n-Performance has been great, as expected on a phone with a Snapdragon 835 processor. I have only had one app closure (Instagram), and just one time, so it might be the app itself and/or Oreo. It feels as fast as the Pixel.\n-App reloading is minimal.\n-For the first few days, I had a hard time putting this phone down and I expected the battery life to be shot but somehow it never was. I can use it heavy and get an entire day (like 24 hours). It was great to get the phone the first night, update all of the apps and then not feel the need to top it off the next morning in order to get through the next work day. \n-This is not a phone where you would worry about battery life, just know that.\n-The fingerprint sensor is fast, sometimes too fast for me when I just want to see what time it is.\n-LTE speeds are solid, as expected for a phone with LTE Category 15 connectivity.\nSony's skin/UI\n-A section for this is necessary, because there are some pros and quirks relating to this.\n-Sony still uses an apps button in the dock to get to your app drawer, which is alright. Not really a con but something to note.\n-They also have this weird thing that if you want to add an app from your app drawer to your home screen, you have to hold the app and drag it to the \"add to home screen\" at the top. This is kind of annoying. At the same time, I enjoy that you can make folders in the app drawer.\n-Sony now has this great feature in the launcher that enables you to use icon packs from the Play Store with the default launcher, which I am enjoying. There are some other small additions, like adjusting the icon size.\n-There's no ambient display/double tap to wake/always on display, which I miss.\n-In regards to the pre-installed apps, AVG Protection, Spotify, Facebook are there. You can't uninstall them, only disable them. I use Spotify so I disabled the other two.\nCameras\n-Sony has finally improved the software processing on the camera side. Pictures are pretty good.\n-Sony is finally done with the never ending list of additional modes.\n-The low light performance has improved. Pictures can get noisy in really low light conditions and a bit yellow but you can adjust the temperature before taking the shot.\n-As for the front camera, you have the option of wide angle and also regular shots. I noticed improvement on this side too (over the X Compact). It just looks better, but has a similar situation in low light as the main camera. Also, the soft skin effect is on by default, which isn't as crazy as it can be in some other phones but I prefer to turn it off.\n-The camera button is so nice to have as well but I only use it to take a shot and not to open the camera since I enabled that on the power button (just personal preference).\nAudio\n-Stereo speakers are so nice to have. It's been a while since I have had a phone with speakers like this.\n-Call quality (no one talks about this, but I'm going to talk about it) is fine. Calling people on 3 different carriers has sounded good. I also don't know if it's just me, but it feels like calls connect much quicker than they have before on my Pixel.\nFinal Thoughts\n-I can see myself keeping this phone. I enjoyed my iPhone SE but the front camera has been hard to me to be pleased with. I have been trying to find an Android replacement for a while now, and I feel that I can finally replace my SE with this phone. I give it a 9 out of 10 because it hits the spot for my most important things in a phone. It's worth the money, but if you want to wait for a price drop, do it.\nThat's all I got.

Which i think makes it a pretty decent deal.)\nHighlights:\n- great performance in a small package (much better thermal performance too compared to Z3/Z5/X Compact)\n- Speakers are finally loud enough\n- IP68 is back\n- the pricing is good\n- 960fps is still awesome.\n- Battery life has been solid\nDownsides:\n- the front camera is bad in low light to me.\n- the rear camera is decent but not the best, it still loses out to a lot of other flagship phones\n- Android Oreo hasn't really been as solid in my time with it? maybe need more time to fix bugs.\n- the fingerprint sensor felt a little mushier than older compact devices, but just nitpicking here.\nNeutral points:\n- The design is still a little old with the large bezels and all, which some may not like. I find it okay though. Like for a smaller size phone i think a bit of bezel looks okay.\n- not sure why sony still using the older style of app drawer, and why they even still have a launcher when they already took out so many features.

To me, the overall size and feel of the phone is what matters, with or without bezels. I was using a compact phone before this so I'm just getting use to a slightly bigger phone. Now though I can say that I'm enjoying the screen size. I think this might be the sweet spot for me. I will say that the build quality and thinness gives you a real feel of quality compared to all the glass phones being pumped out imo. Love the square design as well. Just feels premium or \"executive\" so to speak.\nThe screen has 3 saturation modes. I have it in the middle and the screen is bright and sharp.\nI'll add that the plus with Sony phones is that they are very stockish. No cartoonish look like LG and no lag like Samsung. Negatives would be the Camara in low light. All depends on what you like but I would certainly try the phone out if you're interested.

I can definitely let you know. I hear ya about the bezels.. It just doesn't bother my any. I feel like I'm holding a professional type phone with this solid aluminum build and like you said, the smaller Camara set up. I'd say if Camara quality is important, go pixel. If you think about it, the pixel XL still has slightly bigger bezels than lg and Samsung and everything is not 18by9 ready anyway so you'll still have black bars on many apps and videos.", "time": "10-15-2017 08:27 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6021400", "text": "Remember that the XZ1 just came out so I think this isn't too bad.
