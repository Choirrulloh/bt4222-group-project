(But HDR+ quality was still solid in the old 5).\n\nThey main difference between the 5X/6P and the Pixel 2 is the speed to take photos, launch the camera, focus and process the HDR+ but the quality is really close. \n\nI've decided to stick with HDR+ enhanced (which is similar to the old HDR+ in the Nexus) to minimise the risk of getting unfocused areas that sometimes with the HDR+ are not so detailed. So I'm sacrificing speed to capture photos to try to get always a perfect HDR+ shot.", "time": "4th November 2017, 11:25 PM", "postID": "post74408337", "replies": [{"text": "do you think it's better then middle range budget mirrorless camera ?", "time": "5th November 2017, 02:08 AM", "postID": "post74409631", "replies": [{"text": "I don't know because I stopped using cameras for my trips, since I got a Nexus 5 with HDR+ and before that I mostly used the typical compact Sony cyber shot with Carl Zeiss lense. \n\nAnd I only regret to use smartphone as main camera when I switched from the N5 to Z5 Compact and went to Paris and took ugly photos. Specially nightly photos and closeup photos. This is the main reason I sold that phone after 6 months and went for the 5X.\n\nProbably you can get better details with those cameras you mention. But there are some key features in HDR+ (this is all post processing) that do a lot of magic: \n\n- Focus in most of the areas. (You can focus on a person's face and still capture the details behind a window that points to the street / or the clouds in the sky/ or other faces; as if you had focused directly on that window or clouds). \n- More dark skies at night. The night photos look amazing. Nightly skies try to be converted to a more solid dark colour. \n- Same good quality with sunny photos that have a lot of sunlight or sun rays and you can't see well trough the camera app when taking the photo because of the high brightness. After HDR+ you could have a good result more opaque.\n\nOther things I like from the latest Google phones cameras: \n- Panoramas. Sometimes I take a panorama with just 1 captured image, because of the increased FoV to fit a building. And sometimes you need to take more than 1 because the building still doesn't fit.\n\n- Capture photos when walking: In previous HDR+ Nexus cameras when you press the shutter, camera starts capturing and you can have blurry photos if you were moving. In The Pixel 2 when I press the shutter of the camera (also walking and with HDR+ enhanced) phone camera blocks and take some time to capture to maximize the possibility of a crisp shot. (And if you press the shutter and starts shaking the camera it won't capture till you stop shaking)\nSo I'm taking photos when I don't have time to stop now. \n\n- Minimum focus distance: I love close-ups / macro shots and the latest Google phones had a good minimum focus distance and mixed with HDR+ the result is amazing.\n(The Z5 Compact I owned used to have a wide angle but terrible minimum focus distance I hate this). \n\nWhat I don't really care is the new portrait mode. You get 2 photos when using it. With blurry unfocused areas and the original with no blur. I think this is only useful for CV photos or some close-ups or special cases. There is a lot of people that loves this feature. I personally prefer the photo that contains more data for 99% of my captures.", "time": "5th November 2017, 06:39 AM", "postID": "post74410909", "replies": []}, {"text": "absolutely not.\n\r\nhowever, the pixel takes decent pictures completely automatically while you can completely mess up a picture on a mid range a mirrorless camera if you don't know how to use the settings - and the fully automatic mode of the mirrorless cameras tend not to be actually as good as the pixel\n\r\n(technically, the pixel is also a mirrorless camera btw - just that the sensor and lens are tiny, get less light and aren't as sharp, basically - but they have much better automatic processing)", "time": "6th November 2017, 03:52 AM", "postID": "post74420619", "replies": []}]}]}, {"text": "Absolutely love the camera on my Pixel 2.

Using my eyes alone, I can't tell how much of this is due to undersaturation vs color inaccuracy. The result is that elements that are mostly green (e.g. Google Hangouts icon, plant life in photos) sometimes look noticeably less vibrant in comparison to other elements on the screen.\n- Red is undersaturated relative to the other colors. This is evidenced by the green tint that is clearly visible when viewing yellow and orange colors. Deep reds skew slightly purple as well.\n- The display's color temperature appears cool in all but the brightest of indoor viewing conditions. I'm sure it looks neutral (i.e. great) under the blaring fluorescent lights of an electronics store, but isn't as well suited for home or office viewing. Some people prefer cooler colors. I'm of the mind that neutral or very slightly warm color temperature displays are much easier on the eyes and more visually appealing.\n\nMost 2017 OLED smartphone displays I've seen have the problems I've listed, albeit to varying degrees. I'd chalk it up to the difficulties inherent to OLED screens, but past experience suggests otherwise: I've owned OLED phones with better color accuracy all the way back to 2013. It seems like things really got worse this year. Not sure if its the displays themselves or the color profiles being applied.\n\nUsing the new Saturated color mode swings the color temperature to a more neutral position, but the resulting appearance is way too saturated in general for my liking, and it doesn't completely resolve the issue of inaccurate reds.\n\nI'm disappointed, as the display's color issues cause it to fall short of what I expect to find on a phone in Pixel 2's price range.
