I'm getting the Nokia 9 if the camera is a big improvement. Having said that, I have a Huawei P9 plus which is not a complete slouch in the camera quality department. \nGrabbed a really cool sunset with both phones. Choose the photo you like. Straight out of phone, no processing.\nPersonally, I can't see the benefit of the bothie capability, but I'm sure avid social media users will tease out the benefits if there are any. Maybe it will take Apple to have the feature before it becomes \"magical\" lol. \nStock Android is great if you value prompt updates and getting Android O (and probably P) before most other manufacturers. Stock Android is great to me. I've always installed Nova Launcher on my other phones (to include my Huawei) and we did that on the Nokia 8. It does everything else I want/need without any additional overhead so for me Stock Android is a preference.\nThe Nokia 8 feels good in the hand. Actually a little small after being used to the big/heavy P9 plus. \nBattery capacity was a talking point, but my partner easily gets a day of use with extensive browsing, Youtube, playing games. LINE (sometimes Video call), so any concerns over battery capacity, for us anyway, is a non-issue.\nThere is also some talk about the very limited manual mode for the camera. You can load open camera (which I also loaded to experiment with) but I don't see any big differences in what I can get with the auto settings. Having said that, open camera points to one shortfall in the sensor over what is in the Huawei which can be set to stay open for 30 seconds. It can't be slowed down any more than 0.7\" so if you absolutely need to shutter to stay open longer than that, this phone is not for you. I haven't really noticed a big issue with auto-focus but then it is not all that great on the Huawei either. Can't say we have been frustrated by any auto-focus issues.\nScreen on the Nokia is really nice and IMO is better than the Huawei screen. Richer colors and whiter whites. In fact when you compare the two side by side, you can see how much yellow is in the Huawei screen. Some of that can be adjusted out, but it never looks as good as the Nokia screen. Speaking of the screen, the Nokia is much brighter and easier to read in full daylight than the Huawei P9 plus. \nPrice was fair. We picked it up in Thailand for 19,500 baht which in my native USD conversion is around 585 USD plus we got a bunch of goodies with the deal to include a battery bank. Fairly priced and cheaper than my Huawei P9 plus when I bought it. \nSo anyway, so far, we are very happy with the purchase.

If it looks good enough to be a screen background on a computer, I'm happy. The picture that looks properly exposed with more color was loaded full size (don't know if AC does any compression when loading). That is from the Nokia 8. It looks closest to the conditions at the time. Like any camera and especially with a small sensor, it is just not equipped to pic up all the colors. That sky was truly stunning with a lot more subtle colors with aqua greens out in the bluer sections. The darker photo (I reloaded here full size) was from the Huawei. For some reason, it finds that particular lighting situation very challenging. I tried a couple different shots all with similar results. \nI played around in full daylight one afternoon and I'd say the two phones are fairly close, but I'd still give the edge to the Nokia 8 on color reproduction.

Some initial impressions.\nGreat little phone. Seems T-Mobile US still gets wifi-calling for it despite it being an international model (TA-1052). It's also lacking some of the LTE bands of course. I've yet to fully test the telephony capabilities though. Out and about 4g calls do OK... The speaker is plenty loud, like really loud. Loud as in I hear my notifications across the whole house loud.\nThe screen is really bright. Which is good for me out in the AZ sun. The 700 nits is easily obtained. The colors on it seem a bit saturated but not too much. Having no display calibration or even a sound equalizer is a slight set back for me. It has night mode though . Scrolling is buttery smooth with probably zero stutter or lag.\nBuild quality is superb. Excellent design and as far as asthetics go one handed use works well and easily for me. I am normally a Lumia 950 XL user and that phone for me is fairly easy to use with one hand. The Nokia 8 is slimmer and about the same height/length which makes it even easier to use and handle. Two total different UIs though, so I really should be comparing it to another Android device in that regard...\nThe typical Nokia DTtW and Glance screen work as they should and are perfect features for it. Basic Android (or pure Android with no added software overlay or skin) works fast and fluidly on it. It updated to 8.1 as I set it up...I've yet to go even a full day on the device and so far the battery seems as good as expected.\nThe finger print reader is a bit disappointing though. It seems to inaccurately read my finger sometimes causing me to have to slowly place my print on it or tap the reader a second time in a different position.\nOverall no real complaints though.\nI will add more here to this post if something comes up that I feel others might need to know, good or bad.", "time": "03-02-2018 07:15 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6177569", "text": "Excellent.

I have not done any low light shots yet. I was looking for a thread specifically on the camera/review of its photos but had not seen one here yet. I can add more detail on the camera(s) from my perspective as soon as I have time to use it more. I am not camera power user of course, but will give my 2 cents .\nFor starters. I did have autofocus issues while shooting video, but only after zooming. Or if a bit too much light came into focus. Not a huge deal but it forced me to adjust my physical position a bit. Or to try to manually focus the scene. I shared that in another thread since it seems to be a known quirk. The Nokia 8 does a fairly good job taking pics, although being a regular 950 XL user I would prefer the Lumia over this currently. Comparisons on other sites have shown that it is not what most would expect. However we might give it time. Nokia/HMD will hopefully refine what is already there, and as they fine tune the camera app to work on this device, or push their FW at some point (I hope) then I bet we see camera improvements at the least. It is their first dual camera model, right? Even though Nokia is building new devices on the Android platform it takes RnD like anything else. So I say as far as the cameras go, they are OK or good depending on your perspective, but we may need to give them time to see if they make it better. I'll give myself time too and see what I really think. Maybe their next step is releasing the Nokia ProCam App? I am sure they have a plan of attack or road map for the camera dept. all together.
