For example on startup, the usual white ASUS was a set of vertical white lines, if the display was multi-coloured, the vertical lines would be aligned with the colours. The lines started from about half way up the screen and went down to the bottom. The top half was not affected, so I could see the top half of whatever was displayed, but the bottom half was all vertical lines. This was infrequent at first, but then became more frequent until the phone became virtually unusable.\nI went through a couple of steps to try to fix it:\n1. left it turned off for a few days, then loaded Android 6 from the ASUS website. This worked for the first restart but then the same display issue came back.\n2. spoke to ASUS support, on their recommendation did a factory reset, again the first one worked for a bit, then I tried it again but now nothing worked.\n3. spoke with support again, got an RMA. They made it clear that if the issue is impact damage I'm going to foot the bill. I've requested an \"advanced replacement\" so that I'm not out of a phone for another 2 weeks.\nWhen I was trying to get it to work, I noticed a pattern to the issue. If the display colour, or predominant colour was \"dark\" in the middle third of the screen, the bottom would go wonky as I've described. If the middle third of the display was light or white, the entire screen was okay. So for example, if I had a white website, and scrolled down (or up) to an area that had darker colours, as soon as the dark colour crossed the boundary (about 1/2 inch from the vertical center of the screen, above or below center) the bottom half turned into vertical lines or left a ghost image, or pieces of both.\nI have not damaged the phone, dropped or bent it at all. The one thing that I noticed after the update for 5.1 was that it felt hotter than usual.\nThat's all I have, hopefully someone can help figure out what this is. I'm not expecting to hear much from ASUS themselves, just whether I pay or they cover it. If anyone else is getting this weirdness, join in the conversation. \nThanks in advance.", "time": "01-03-2017 12:41 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5630638", "text": "Welcome to Android Central!

I would like to thank Asus and AndroidCentral for giving me one to review. Frankly, I've been putting off writing this because I really want to like it more than I do and I was hoping it would grow on me. But I want to be completely honest in my review, so I do have to say that overall I have been disappointed. I won't bother to post the specs or things that have been posted many times here already as most already know that - I will just stick to my experience of it.\nNow I am encouraged that two of the bugs - one major and one minor - that I've been experiencing appear to have been fixed in the update I downloaded tonight. That was what finally made me feel ready to write this since I was feeling a bit more positive after that. Hopefully the bug fixes will continue. I do know that there have been several updates so I think that is a good sign that it is being actively supported to some extent.\nSo to start on a positive note - the phone is quick. It handles most apps and functions easily. It matches my Note 3 in that respect. It boots quickly and most apps open relatively quickly. I've found that some games seem to freeze up for a couple seconds, however, but I haven't had a problem with functional apps that are less resource intensive. (Some games can be problems on any phone as well). So overall, good processor performance. I also like the 4GB RAM that can hold more apps open than my 3GB Note 3.\nThe build quality is solid, but as I and some others found out, it can be too solid. I had a terrible time getting the back cover off and actually hurt myself, ripping off both thumbnails. I'm still physically in pain from it a week later - seriously. After wrapping up my bleeding thumbs, it then took me an hour prying it off with an eyeglass screwdriver. Three other people found it impossible to open as well, even with tools, and thought I had glued it shut and was pulling a prank on them. Now as discussed in other threads, everyone didn't have this problem, but clearly there were some bad units sent out, mine included. \nThe phone is heavier than expected. Not a problem at all - some people may even prefer this - but I was just surprised that it's noticeably heavier than my Note 3. I actually inadvertently threw my Note 3 because after using my Zenfone for a long period, I picked up the Note and it flew out of my hand because it felt so much lighter in comparison. I'm not considering the weight a negative - just an observation.\nAsus was kind enough to include a flip cover case with the phone and I'm used to using one on my Note 3 so I do like these type of covers. It shows some useful information in the window like number of notifications, clock, calendar and some useful functions like camera, flashlight, and some quick settings. It provides some protection for the phone - minimal protection in a drop - but good protection while in a bag or pocket. I'm not a fan of the material used for cover - I prefer the Note's S-view cover - but I still like the cover and appreciate having it.\nNow my biggest problem with the phone - the display. It is really poor in my opinion. I am totally open to the possibility that my unit may be worse than others since I haven't seen others complain about this, but I have no other Zenfone 2 to compare it to, so I can only base my review on the one in my hand. I really truly have a hard time looking at it. \nFirst, it has a pinkish hue to it. Even if I manually adjust the color settings to the opposite extreme so that everything looks very blue and green, the white backgrounds will still amazingly have a pink tint to them. I've tried every color adjustment and it won't go away. It is distinctly pink. Besides the color issue, the display is very, very, very dull. Again, this stays the same no matter the adjustments made. \nSometimes I turn on my Note 3 screen just to look at it because looking at the Zenfone screen actually makes me sad and irritated. It also puts a great physical strain on my eyes. I didn't realize how much it was affecting me until my battery died and I switched to my Note 3 and I stopped squinting and my headache went away and I felt instantly more relaxed. This happens everytime I switch between my Zenfone 2 and my Note 3. And putting the phones side by side with the same thing on the screen, the difference in displays is absolutely ridiculous.\nMy second biggest issue is the battery. In my opinion, if a phone has a non-replaceable battery, it should be optimized for good battery life. This phone does not even have mediocre battery life. It has very bad battery life. On average, I get about 2 to 2 1/2 hours screen on time over an 8 hour period, with everything I can possibly shut off or disable, and with the screen on the lowest brightness setting. Even on ultra power saving mode the whole time and the screen on lowest brightness, I got just over 3 hours right off a full charge. Of course I can't use the phone that way normally - it was just a test - but that's a really bad result. I have had to constantly switch to my Note 3 because of my battery dying.\nNow, if you are near an outlet, charging is a breeze. The quick charger included with the phone does a great job. Very happy with that. But, if like me you are often away from an outlet most of the daytime, you simply can't use this unless you carry multiple portable chargers with you everywhere. I could never use the Zenfone as my only phone because it simply doesn't last anywhere near long enough to get me through between charges. Because I only have one portable charger, which is not enough for this quick draining phone, I also carry my Note 3 with me everywhere, which never runs out of battery before I get home despite having a replaceable battery.\nThe touchscreen is also not very responsive. It's never a smooth experience. It doesn't scroll smoothly and it doesn't respond to touches consistently. I have to leave glove mode on all the time just to have it register my presses without anything covering my fingers. And even with glove mode on, it is not smooth or responsive. Lots of extra presses, hard presses, dragging and sticking - not good. This makes the lack of illumination of the softkeys even more frustrating since I have to press a dozen times minimum every time I'm trying to press one of those buttons.\nI've found the software more buggy than I expected. I do give some leeway to new phones since I know some bugs just are never found until a lot of users get there hands on them. So I was not expecting a bug-free experience by any stretch. But there were more problems than expected and it leaves a not-finished impression. \nThe major bug I mentioned that appears to have been fixed in the latest update is the VPN reboot bug. Anytime I connected via VPN, the phone would reboot within 1-2 minutes, making VPN unusable. For those of us who need (or want) to use a VPN connection, this is a dealbreaker. Now I only tested this once since the update, but this was the first time it did not crash and reboot, so I'm hoping it has been fixed completely but I'll need more testing.\nThe rather minor bug that I mentioned that seems to also be fixed is not being able to delete Gmail from the notification pulldown. It would just not ever respond if you hit delete. I just deleted my first gmail from the pulldown right before writing this, so that was good.\nA few of the many other bugs are repeated crashes of the Android System UI in ultra power saving mode, particularly when it first starts. Sometimes I get 10 in the row, making the phone non-functional for long periods and it freezes for sometime after each crash as well. Not being able to send or receive MMS in the Asus messaging app with Wifi on - won't switch to data. Constant connection errors in the stock email app even though there is no problem with the connection or the email accounts. There are many other bugs but I can't list them all here. \nThe auto-start manager, which I was originally very happy to see included, is a huge fail. It simply doesn't work. It does not stop the apps you mark from starting and it resets a lot of your settings upon reboot, defeating the purpose. Even the ones it does not reset, it does not stop them from starting, so it is useless. This is still true even after the update.\nOne Asus app I do like, that is not specific to only the Zenfone 2, is Asus PC Link. I've made a separate thread about that a few days ago so I won't repeat everything. But if you have a Windows PC (or an emulator possibly if you use another OS), you can mirror your phone and it has a couple of other cool functions. I've been using that everyday. \nThe physical buttons - volume and power - have poor placement and are difficult to use. The power button is difficult to press and its placement, on top of the phone, requires you to always use two hands to press the button. The phone does have a setting to turn the screen on by tapping the screen, which I like, but when pressing the power button is needed, it's annoying. \nThe volume buttons on back of the phone are very difficult to feel and I always am pressing the camera lens area instead. Most importantly, it's impossible to press the volume buttons while on a call without using two hands (assuming you are not using a headset to control volume). If you hold the phone up to your ear, there is no way to reach the volume button with that hand, which is important to be able to adjust during a phone call. \nWell there is a lot more I could write but I think this has been long enough and you get the idea. I was really expecting to like this phone. And be certain that I am keeping in mind the whole time that it is only $299 full price for this phone so I am not expecting it to match my Note 3. But the two dealbreakers for me are the poor display and the battery life. If I can't stand looking at a phone for more than a couple minutes and the battery doesn't even last me a third of the time I need it to under normal circumstances, then it just doesn't matter how inexpensive it is. \nI hope this is not seen as ungrateful since I received the phone for free. But I did agree to review it and wanted to be honest about my experience. I know several others have stated how much they like the phone, so my experience and opinion is only one, and that is why many of us were given phones for review and not just one person.", "time": "06-05-2015 04:02 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4472942", "text": "I am still customizing my phone and I am going to try to use it primarily all weekend so that I can finalize some thoughts.

Each time it vibrates, the screen comes alive,. (while the phone is charging when on, I get the Swipe To Unlock screen and when it's off, I get the Battery Charging graphic). What POSSIBLE reason could there be for it to do this?!\nNow, I know I made an absolute howler of a rookie error in my other post why my phone wouldn't connect to the net to sort out my Google account,.. (I just rebooted my modem and it worked, I'm sorry. Foolish mistake. lol),.. but THIS issue seems completely the strangest thing I haver ever encountered with a phone.\nI can't see a reason why it would need to do it. Phone is not using wifi when switched off, (charging), I have only my 2G SIM card, (2nd slot) active,.. apart from that, I have no idea what might be a factor. Most of the vibrates are the short, weak ones, but then in slightly rarer instances, the phone vibrates more strongly for a second or so. It's done this contantly since I first plugged it in to charge.\nDoes anyone have any ideas? Is it just a Lollipop 5.0 bug or is it a 'feature' of some sort or is it that I'm using a mini-USB charge cable that the phone doesn't like, (I'm using a fairly expensive, braided, mini-USB cable)? Should I be using the USB cable that came with the phone and using it from my mains instead of my USB 2.0 port from my PC? \nI can't see what else it could be that's causing it to ramdonly vibrate as often as it is. Oh, I have seen in google searches people talking of a vibrate/sound happening when the battery fully charges,.. but my phone's vibrating, (and turning on my screen every time), when the phone's charging, but at the time of typing this, I have yet to notice if it's vibrating at all when the phone's fully completed a charge - I'll edit this when/if I notice if it does the vibrating after the phone's been fully charged.\nAny help appreciated, thanks.", "time": "11-21-2015 08:39 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4857359", "text": "Dear OneOffCharlie74,\nThe symptom described usually indicates the mini USB cable is not making a proper connection or possibly the cable is defective.

The latest software upgrade was made 2 weeks back. Now the phone shows some erratic behaviour as listed below:\n1.\tIn switched ON condition, the phone sometimes just automatically vibrates continuously and drains the battery. The vibration can be stopped by continuously pressing the power button. The battery is getting drained due to this.\n2.\tThe battery charging is NOT possible through power plug. But it can be charged through usb connection with PC. But charging rate is very very slow (indicated time 7-8 hours to full charge). But in between the charging, phone will start to vibrate automatically and drains the battery. \n3.\tWhen the phne is switched OFF, sometimes the camera flash light just flashes for a moment, which also drains the battery.\n4.\tI thought to wipe the cache partition to remove any junk files of old upgardes. But the phone does not go to Recovery mode to do this. Once I select the recovery mode, it just goes blank and continuously vibrates. \n5.\tWhen the Wifi is swipped ON/OFF, it may or may not respond.\n6.\tThere are NO heating issues during charging or during the erratic continuous vibration of phone.\n7.\tPhone calls/ messaging can be done without any issue. But I am not currently using the phone because the phone can anytime go to the continuous vibration mode and related erratic behaviour, and hence battery drain/ unable to charge through power plug.\n8.\tPhone was NEVER subjected to any physical damage like falling from height or contact with water, NOR was done anything related to software other than regular upgades for the latest software version and wipe cache paritions after updates (cannot be done for the last update, since the phone does not allow to go to recover mode as mentioned in pt 4)\nThe phone is sill in the warranty period.

They're also a very easy company to work with, have an on-line chat manned by knowledgeable people, answer emails promptly (like an email I sent on Sunday night that I received an answer to by 10 AM Monday morning - and that was 7 AM their time).\n2. Samsung and SanDisk make the chips that are inside the card. Everyone else buys from them. Are they always getting the best chips? Who knows?

My concern is battery issue using both sims. So to echo the OP: 1. battery life-honest assessment, especially with TWO active lines. \nI switched from Note 3 as my main phone to a Windows Phone due to battery life being a priority, but ultimately I'd like to combine to one phone if I can as I have two lines that I am now using. How often are people charging-how much is left at end of day? (I realize this is based on personal usage, but compared with your past phones for example)\nI'm not happy with the voice mail view on the Note 3-without manually checking-I barely even realized that I had missed a call. So 2. Does the ZenUI offer a voicemail inbox indicator that is any better than the visual voicemail that I downloaded for my Note? It's not that prominent. Maybe there is a 3rd party app I could be using-if so-feel free to say that would be the case with a Zenfone2. My Windows Phone is fine-I have a standby screen that shows me right away that I have missed calls-it works for me. Mind you, I am prepared to go sole Android if the Zenfone 2 can meet my profile, but the battery is what matters. I only need the phone and SMS and not even the data part, so being consigned to like what is it 2G speeds there is fine as I won't ever use SIM 2 for data. 3.

I needed a phone with max RAM because I do a lot of multi-tasking between apps and found my 2gb phone kept closing apps that I needed. This really shouldn't be a problem with Android being able to handle memory correctly, but when an app isn't written well, they'll crash when Android closes them and I get a crash error. Having this problem all the time working between apps is just a pain. And at the same time I can't afford the $600-$800 phones that have more RAM. For some strange reason I wanted to see if anyone made a 4gb phone so I googled it and found this phone. I was absolutely shocked to find one with 4gb RAM and 64gb storage for only $300 on Amazon. This is unheard of and I didn't hesitate to buy it at that price. I even read the reviews, 4.5 stars with 800+ reviews, wow! This phone also comes with the MicroSD slot capable for a 64gb card, although I've read people have even used a 128gb card successfully. \nMy two cons, but only personal cons. The phone is too large for me. I like smaller phones that I can easily carry on my side and fit in one hand. My Samsung Galaxy Avant is the perfect size and I would go with the iPhone 5S if I had the money and wasn't already an android fan. But there's not a small phone on the market with this type of horsepower and at this price level. I seriously looked at the Sony Xperia Z3 compact, but decided against it due to cost and Sony just doesn't seem to be hanging into the cellphone market. \nThe second con is the embedded battery. I swore I'd never buy a phone with a non-removable battery. I'm the type who doesn't replace his electronic devises every two years, and I can't see sending it in for replacement, what a gimmick. However, I needed more RAM and at this price I couldn't turn it down. \nI cannot validate the complaints of battery heat and poor battery life. There's some heat from the battery and the battery doesn't last all day long, but that's because I'm a very heavy user. Nothing worse than any other phones I've had. \nOverall, I completely recommend this phone, the 4gb model. If Asus keeps this quality up at this price point, they're going to do some serious damage to the other high-priced phone manufacturers.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "08-08-2015 06:26 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4597843", "text": "No heat issues here, only time it gets toasty is while quick charging.

Issue is that my main number was a nano SIM previous to this anyway which they woun't be able to fit in anyway. Also--my SIM 2 reception is very flimsy. It is not as strong as SIM 1.

If the exchange doesn't resolve my problem, I can see myself returning the Zenfone2 and going after the Blu Pure XL, and had the Pure XL been on the market already, it would have been the one I'd have gotten because of the screen size. The 5.5 Zenfone2 is still okay, but I definitely prefer the larger screens. As for bloatware, it can be disabled-the functionality of the Zenfone is fine and I can speak to that. I like the phone very much and prefer to at this point be able to keep it since I already have it, but the issue for me is that I have two phone lines, and the second SIM slot on mine does not pick up a reliable signal in my home, but it works 99% everywhere else, so my concern is that it's not a hardware problem, but I'm asking for an exchange anyway just to see. I need to be able to receive calls on that second line and I can't when I'm at home, so clearly that's a huge problem. The signal drops left and right. Calls fail or can't be initiated in the first place-my SIM 2 sometimes totally X's out. Even when it doesn't, when I'm at home it's practically useless. Meantime I have no problem with the other SIM slot at all. There is a notion that it is connected to the fact that the Zenfone's second SIM slot only supports 2G and somehow this still is connected to phone calls as well, and if that's the case, my house must not like a 2G only SIM slot! So as long as BOTH the Blu Pure XL's SIM slots support all the higher bands, then I should be fine. \nAsus does put out regular firmware updates and there is a pretty active user forum, so I am otherwise pleased with the Zenfone.

I will hope that my problems with SIM 2 reception in my home were due to a faulty device somehow. I sure hope it works out and is fine. It is still a question mark as to what the real cause of poor call reception was-2G data in the SIM slot? People on AT&T forums theorize, but an AT&T rep told me that would not cause call reception problems, so who knows. If reception is fine on the replacement, then I'll know it was a defective phone. If not, then, the question will still remain. It still in any event is strange that my SIM 2 is virtually unusable in my house but then works fine almost everywhere else-that still points to something that doesn't sound 100% like a defective device, just very strange, but if a new device resolves the issue, I'll be quite happy, and I really hope that will take care of it. Now-to the point of responsibility for their product--- In the short several weeks I've owned the phone, I've had regular updates, so I do appreciate that Asus stays on top of that which is one thing in their favor.

I haven't received any calls yet as it's the weekend and my second line, so it's too early to know for sure, but I made a few outbound calls and called into the voice mail as a test and it seems better though I am still seeing the second SIM X out on me at times for a brief second. When I go to check my voice mail, it skips the message too which is weird, which again, I wonder is due to reception issues. It then does go to the skipped message. I'm off work this week but will have my phone out and about to test in multiple locations. Right now the signal strength on SIM 1 is 3 bars at home and SIM 2 is only at 1 bar. I'm not too encouraged by that. What in the world can be so off with the reception in my house for that second sim slot? It works everywhere else okay. If it truly has some connection to the fact that SIM 2 only supports 2G data, then this will support me going after the Blu phone . AT&T claims that the 2G slot should have nothing to do with call reception though. Who knows-but then why is it the one with the problem, and why only at my house?", "time": "09-20-2015 07:57 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4704366", "text": "Update. Things have worsened and are a no go for me. I'm planning on the Pure XL for sure now. MY SIM 2 has reverted to unusable like before. Replacement phone, replacement SIM doesn't matter. 2G is the issue. My area is too up to date obviously that 2G slots are too outdated. I plan to get the Pure XL which I believe has both LTE SIM slots.I'm very disappointed. I really like the ZF2 and wish this wasn't the case, but I can't use the second sim line on it when I'm anywhere near my home which renders things quite useless since I got this so that I could have both phone numbers on it. Today I got a new SIM card again, the firmware is up to date, though I have kept it up to date the whole time, it's a replaced ZF2 and all, and the problem is even worse. AT&T confirmed that the 2G slot is the problem. So this phone clearly is not usable as a dual SIM for me, and is going back to ASUS and I have to now take it up with them. But this now puts the Pure XL in prime position. I actually like the larger screen anyway, although at this point since I had the ZF2 already and was happy otherwise, I really wanted to just have that work out but it didn't. It's foolish that they put 2G in there so people might want to take note that. I didn't think it would matter just for phone calls and boy in my case have I been sadly mistaken. I can get calls in a lot of places, but I can't in and around my own home and it's a place I need to be able to on my second number so the phone has to go back, period. I can go back to my Note 3 and Windows phone until the Pure XL comes in. I'll have to get a nano SIM again for the Windows phone, and then another SIM when the Pure XL comes in, but that's life. Either that or forward my calls again like I did last week when I waited for the replacement ZF2.", "time": "09-23-2015 07:23 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4705280", "text": "Blu does look like a nice phone, but I fear Blu won't offer many (if any truly worthwhile ) updates at all based on some reviews I've read online.\nSample review info:Good luck and I hope it works out.

Once an area is upgraded, look out. In my case, thankfully things worked out-but that's because Amazon did right by me. I was outside of the timeframe for returns but they recognized that it was genuinely a problem that I couldn't have become aware of until the timing I did, because I was getting calls on SIM 2 fine in areas 30 miles west of where I live, thinking my phone was fine, but then when I started getting calls later in the day when I was actually at HOME, but , a few weeks later, that's when I found out that things were NOT fine. I had no way of knowing. And I had changed SIM cards twice and gone through a full RMA and several support chat sessions with AT&T so Amazon could see I really tried. But in the end, AT&T concluded that my area is upgraded and the 2G towers are shutting down bit by bit and therefore I'm not going to get a reliable connection in that 2G slot and that even includes just for phone calls. Well, that's totally worthless. It's disappointing as it's a great phone otherwise for those who only need one number. But as a dual SIM, let me tell you-it does not work and ASUS needs to make their next one with double LTE slots or just make it single SIM, period and lower the price because they are duping people into thinking it is functional as a dual SIM when there are people like me in upgraded tower areas. I wasted so much time with this, and ASUS doesn't think they owed me anything back. Amazon thank goodness thought of the customer experience. What is ASUS thinking of making that second SIM 2G? In any event, again, I am relieved as I got my money back and the phone is gone and on its way back to Amazon today already. I'm back on my Note 3 and using my cheap Alcatel actually on my second line right now since it uses a micro SIM. I do have a 1520 Lumia but it uses a nano SIM and I just don't feel like changing SIM cards again, then having to change again if I opt to get the Pure XL, and so forth-this is getting tiring! I happened to have the Alcatel from before when I added the second line before I decided to get a real phone for it so I kept it as a back-up.

Not sure how good Lenovo and Alcatel are at keeping their phones updated, but they're almost certainly not as good.\nThe ZenFone 2's also have a really good camera.", "time": "01-20-2016 11:37 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "How to enable 2g data on 2nd SIM ?", "thread": [{"postID": "post4472900", "text": "I have enabled data on my first SIM no problem.

[{"title": "Asus Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition", "thread": [{"postID": "post4810447", "text": "It\u2019s name may be more than a mouthful, but the ZenFone 2 Deluxe Special Edition is here. Many of you have been waiting eagerly for this device because it is the granddaddy of the ZenFone 2 family. Let\u2019s take a quick look at what\u2019s inside.\nPackaging \u2013 Who doesn\u2019t love carbon fiber?\nBefore we roll out the red carpet, I wanted to compliment our design team on the packaging. It has a smooth carbon fiber wrapping and the ZenFone 2 Deluxe logo is stamped on the top along with words Special Edition on the angled corner. When we open up the packaging, we have the phone, charging adapter, extra back cover, and documentation. The team did a great job with this and it gives a really nice experience.\nHardware \u2013 More storage and more back covers!\nLet\u2019s get into the phone, shall we? In terms of the upgrades, the Special Edition features an extra 64GB of onboard storage (for a total of 128GB), that means you can take up to an extra 45,000 pictures! Also, everyone\u2019s been asking about back covers, and how much they loved the Deluxe\u2019s 3D back cover that changed from purple, to blue, and then teal. This time, the Special Edition offers TWO exclusive back covers! One has a sleek carbon-fiber styling that gives it that extra tough look. The other is a faceted style, like the Deluxe\u2019s, but instead comes in a smooth and shiny metallic silver. It feels great in the hand and isn\u2019t slippery.\nSoftware \u2013 Red and Black is hot.\nZenUI has been revamped with a new look and it is SLICK. To go along with the red trim of the Special Edition, unique icons, wallpaper, and notification menu was created to complete the package. Each icon is outlined in red against a 3D-looking black disk and the application folders mimic the style.Note: Settings menu, dialer have stock ZenUI theme.\nIt\u2019s a ZenFone 2, but special-er!\nThe original ZenFone 2 is still a great device for everyone because of the value it brings. And like the original, this Special Edition inherits the Dual-SIMs, 4GBs of RAM and the Intel\u00ae Atom\u2122 Z3580 processor. What makes this device so awesome though is the updated styling, exclusive back covers, and twice the space for more of your games, pictures, videos, and data.

I guess aside from saving the connector, having an iphone before means wearing out cables gets expensive, but not with micro usb.\nSD Card - the latest galaxy phones got rid of the SD card slot, which is a big, big no no, on a budget, and on principle, I don't want to have to pay a load of money to get chipped memory when you can buy micro SD cards so much cheaper.\nUSB host functionality - I deal with moving data around a lot, and being able to use the phone to hook up to flash drives (or even external hard drives, with an external power adapter of course) is critical, I'm not sure what android phones are like for this, or if some manufacturers don't allow this functionality.\nSo, if someone could offer some advice/point me in the right direction that would be fantastic.", "time": "12-29-2015 01:19 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4922230", "text": "Ok well for some reason this ended up in the zenfone section.", "time": "12-29-2015 03:48 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "My Asus Zenfone 2 deluxe 64gb turns off like it's dead, how can I fix this?", "thread": [{"postID": "post4921585", "text": "my phone ( Asus zenfone 2 deluxe 64gb) got switched off. it seems like dead. plz help how to restart my phome. volum down n power key ... nothimg hyappened", "time": "12-29-2015 09:59 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Just ordered Zenfone 2 laser", "thread": [{"postID": "post4918577", "text": "Just ordered the ZenFone 2 Laser ZE551KL 32GB model.

A big reason why I was picked, I believe, was that I was previously carrying around three phones: a work phone, a personal phone, and an Android phone I used as a media player. I thought I'd share a few things I've found after transferring both my SIM cards to the Zenfone2. FWIW, my SIM1 is my AT&T work SIM, since they pay for a big data plan, and my SIM2 is a T-Mobile SIM tied to my personal phone number. \nPhone-wise everything is more or less okay from what I can tell. Incoming and outgoing calls go as expected. The built in dialer seems pretty good, maybe even great. You have to choose which SIM to use every time you dial, which is a bit annoying, but I'm sure I'll get used to it. It would be nice if there was a way to permanently mark a contact as a SIM1 or SIM2 contact, but if it exists I haven't found it. I still haven't tried a bluetooth call from my car, but I'm hoping incoming and outgoing calls will be handled easily. \nOne not-so-shocking phone related thing I noticed was the T-Mobile's visual voicemail app doesn't work with the \nText messages are a little more complicated. The built in ASUS SMS app is pretty decent and has a buttons to send from either SIM1 or SIM2. Previously I was using EvolveSMS which I loved, but it's dual SIM support is non existent. It will receive texts from both SIMs fine, but all replies will be sent from SIM1. Since my SIM1 is my work phone (because it has a giant data plan) this is a bit of a deal breaker for me. For me the big loss here is custom notifications. EvolveSMS gave me the ability to assign custom sounds/icons for texts from certain people. I also had it set up to re-notify every five minutes if there was an unread text, something that saved me a ton of times when I didn't heard my phone ring or feel it vibrate. I've also been using MightyText to send and receive texts on my laptop. Once again everything here defaults to SIM1. Both of these things are really annoying to me, but not really ASUS' fault. Apparently the dual SIM implementation is non-standard (at least prior to 5.1) so apps are not really able to be written in a way that supports all dual SIM phones. I'm hoping the popularity of the ZF2 might make some app makers include this ability in a future update, but I'm not holding my breath. \nHas anyone else found any hiccups in their workflow using two SIMs?", "time": "05-30-2015 09:50 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4458739", "text": "I'm using dual Sim too, but I have the reverse setup, my personal T-Mobile Sim is sim 1 , work at&t is Sim 2.\nTheir is a setting for which Sim to default for when using Bluetooth so that should work fine.

Some highlights:SIM/Micro SD: both are dual SIM and support micro SD.Battery: equivalently sized batteries in both, although the Zenfone 2 supports fast charging.Size/Weight: the A8 is 12% lighter and 46% thinner than the Zenfone 2 at its thickest point.Screen: almost identically sized screens; 5.7\" Super AMOLED (A8) vs. 5.5\" IPS (Zenfone2)Camera: 13MP (Zenfone 2) vs. 16MP (A8), both have roughly similar functionsRAM/Storage: 4GB RAM/32GB (Zenfone 2) vs. 2GB RAM/32GB (A8)CPU/GPU: Intel Atom Z3580 (Zenfone 2) vs. Exynos 5 Octa 5430; PowerVR G6430 (Zenfone 2) vs. Mali-T628 MP6 (A8)WiFi/Bluetooth: identical WiFi and Bluetooth support (except the A8 supports Bluetooth LE)4G LTE: the Zenfone 2 supports more LTE bands (although not relevant for my market)\nSpecs alone can't tell you how a phone performs in real life. That said, the Zenfone 2 has twice the RAM of the A8; the A8 has faster RAM (LPDDR4 vs. LPDDR3). As for camera quality, I can't say because there are no direct comparisons between the two phones.\nIn regards to battery life, here's what GSM Arena reported for the two phones:\nA8: 98h \"endurance rating\", 25:02h 3G talk time; 12:18h web browsing; 12:45h video playback\nZ2 (single SIM): 62h \"endurance rating\", 15:47h 3G talk time; 7:52h web browsing; 8:43h video playback\nThe battery performance for the A8 was quite surprising, especially given the atrocious battery performance of other Samsung phones like the S6.\nFinally, there's the question of Android version. The Zenfone 2 still ships with Lollipop 5.0, whereas the A8 ships with 5.1.1. I don't believe either company has official confirmed upgrades to Marshmallow, although based on what I've seen in this forums, the unofficial response from Asus is that the Zenfone 2 ZE551ML will skip Lollipop 5.1.1 and go directly to Marshmallow. As for the A8, it would be surprising if it didn't get upgraded, although who knows when this will happen.", "time": "11-06-2015 03:49 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4808899", "text": "I have a Zenfone 2 (the top of the line, with the fastest Atom processor, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB internal storage), and it's quite good. The main drawback I see is that the battery life isn't as good as it could be, which I think has to do with the processor. When I look at it with an app like CPU-Z, it seems that none of the 4 main cores ever becomes idle (as opposed to Snapdragon processors, and presumably Exynos), which might contribute to battery drain. I get decent screen-on time (maybe around 5 hrs), but where this impacts battery life is when it's idle. This issue is partially offset by the quick charging--it charges up very quickly.\nASUS is pretty diligent with updates, both for the system and for preinstalled apps (like Contacts, Calendar, Dialer). On the other hand, there's a lot of bloatware. Some of it is pretty useful, but much isn't. Of course, Samsung is no stranger to bloat either. I would hope that ASUS will update this phone to Marshmallow, but it's by no means guaranteed.\nCamera is very good. Screen is nice, although not as bright as I'd like. One advantage of the IPS LCD vs the Samsung's AMOLED is that there's no risk for burn-in.\nHopefully someone else can chime in about the A8!", "time": "11-06-2015 12:48 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4810257", "text": "Thanks for the great reply!

If you can remove the battery for at least a minute, replace it and try to charge it again. If the device is overheated it will not charge but add you've had it off of the charger for some time now it should be cool. If it won't charge still try a different cable and charger. Also check that there isn't any debris in the port. The reason I mention the port is because the buzzing could be an indication that it wasn't connected well and may have either been shorting or cross circuited. This can also occur of the phone had become wet or damp or if your cable has become damaged. Even if it doesn't appear to be charging leave it plugged in unless the buzzing returns then try something else. Also be sure the phone doesn't start to over heat, again this could be a sign that something is crossed. Uncooked rice over night may help if there's a chance it could have seen moisture, hopefully tho it won't be damaged from having power applied in that condition however these devices are kind of smart and may not have allowed the charge if it sensed moisture, maybe. Let's see if we can get it to charge and see if it'll turn on from there. I will say this showing it to turn its self off is not good for the device. While I realize that in this case it was unexpected, I will go on to say that sudden power loss in a device like this is similar to holding the power button on your PC until it turns off. It can have unexpected repercussions, and just like your PC may need a moment while it checks its files and OS for damage before allowing a restart. So if the LED didn't light right away don't panic.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "10-02-2015 04:16 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4725100", "text": "Thank you for your reply.

We have the Zenfone 2 which was announced at CES in January and yet Asus took (or had to take) this incremental global release step all the way into the beginning of Q3. \nThe irony comes in where the more popular smartphone brands such as Samsung and HTC released their flagships globally more efficiently, but so far it's not really any better since they have more major shortcomings than the Zenfone 2. So the \"Zen\" element comes in strongly here, haha.\nIn the case of the (ever overrated) Galaxy S6/Edge, many owners have had to exchange that device at least 3 times for faults, both minor and major. Most current Zenfone 2 owners haven't needed to do that other than getting a more LTE-compatibile model. Yes, there have been a few cases of serious faults and the popular bugs, but that's to be expected all across the board for first releases. \nGenerally though, from the testimonies of the owners, it's a very stable and well made device.

Because I could easily afford it, and so I wouldn't have this nagging feeling that I should have gotten the upgraded version.

My focus is to comment relative to some of the biggest concerns and criticisms that I read about before purchasing my Zenphone 2. I spent more than 9 hours reading and watching videos about the zenphone and similar devices before making a decision to buy. Thank you internet & commerical community for these reviews!, as they helped me sort through the pros/cons of this specific device and apply my own set of filters to your opinions. Of course I wanted to like the phone by the time it arrived in my hands, so these views may be slanted in that respect, but I am trying to be objective here. (For some background, my current phone is a Nexus 4 running 4.4 kitkat, and I have previously used iOS and Palm devices).\n1) Physical Button location - I do not mind that the power button is located on top. In fact I prefer it there after using the phone, partly because of the double tap wake/sleep feature and partly due to the physical size of the phone. I can palm a basketball, but I still find the phone a handful to hold. The Nexus 4 was the ideal size in comparison, never feeling too large in the hand. But my eyes wanted the larger screen of the Zenphone 2, so I was willing to make that tradeoff. The phone gets switched on/off as it is being picked up/placed down, so using the off hand to press the power button is not a big deal for me and does not interfer with one handed operation. I also like that the volume button is on the back, to eliminate all side buttons which would make the phone harder to use one handed.\n2) Volume - Max speaker volume is a louder and richer than the Nexus 4, but it is still not great and radiates away out the back. Extra loud volume is desired when watching videos or listening to podcasts that were recorded too low, or if I want to step into the next room and still hear it playing. The volume goes loud enough for the most situations and should not be a deal breaker for someone considering this phone. Still I would like for it to be able to get extra loud and blast my ears.\n3) Display - a) Some say the phone does not go dim enough, which I would agree. It is hard to use the phone in the dark without overpowering your eyes. b) Others say that the display cannot get bright enough, I have not experienced this issue though I generally try to avoid direct sunlight. Except for in-the-dark viewing, I have liked the automatic brightness settings. c) Still other people want a QHD or higher resolution display, but I think that would be a mistake and increase device cost and everyday performance cost with almost no benefit since the PPI is already 403.\n4) Case Material - I read many almost apologetic reviews about \"build quality\" with I interpret as a euphemism for whether the case is made of plastic or not. I prefer plastic because it is cheap, light weight, antenna friendly, comes in multiple colors, provides durability when dropped, allows easier access to the internal slots, etc. I suspect if plastic was expensive and added $50 to the cost, many of the negative reviewers would turn positive and sing about its praises. My glass backed Nexus 4 may feel nice in the hand, but it adds weight and the device must be kept in a case to protect against breaking from accidental drops, making its superior build quality a mute point. I like the etched plastic (metallic looking) case of the Zenphone 2. Its plastic caseback and easy access to the internal SIM/SDXC slots was a very positive selling point for me, and I was not disappointed upon receiving the phone.\n5) Asus software bloat - Almost every reviewer who has used a lot of different Android devices gave big negative comments about the pre-installed Asus software, a few even seemed to give this enough weight to recommend an alternate phone. I don't agree with their thinking, especially since these same experts are the very people who are knowledgeable enough to quickly stop, uninstall or ignore applications that they do not like. I do not dismiss their criticisms entirely, but I believe the intention of the pre-installed software is to help those who have less experience with a smartphone; for some people this will be their first Android phone and they may have limited data connection or experience in downloading and choosing Apps. I do prefer a stock Android experience, but I have not found the Asus experience to be a negative. For now, I have moved all the Asus apps to a different window pane, so I came keep them organized as compared to what I have installed. A few of them have came in handy, even though a few of the \"helpful\" ones like Boost are a little annoying. \n6) Intel processor - Before purchasing I was skeptical of the Intel processor, even though no reviewer had posted a negative comment about its software compatibility. Years ago I had a bad experience using a first generation Intel chipset running an older version Android. There were lot of software bugs, most were in Android and some were in the underlying firmware. Thus far I have been pleasantly surprised about how everything just works as expected. No hint that there is an Intel instead of a Qualcomm chipset inside the phone.\n7) Camera - This got mixed reviews from others. I have not used it enough to form any real opinion. The few photos I have taken using the automatic settings looked better than my Nexus 4. I expect it to work well enough for travel and everyday activities. I have a digicam for more serious photo taking, but I hope this will replace it for some shots.\n8) non-Backlit Capacitive buttons - On screen buttons would be preferable, but I am okay with the capacitive buttons. When I used Android for the first time after iOS one of the things I really liked was the \"back\" button in addition to the singular home button. Back-lighting would be nice for very low light conditions, but since I know where the buttons are, it is not a significant issue for me. That said, I do think this could be an issue for a new smartphone user and it does detract from the overall polish of the phone. \n9) Price - Almost every reviewer gives positive comments about the price relative to its specs. I wavered on whether to buy the 64GB or 16 GB model. I believe the 16 GB model would meet my needs and was offered at a good price, but I also thought Asus was offering some real value with the 64 GB model (not just charging consumers a premium for more Flash) so that is the model I chose. I hope Asus made a little better margin on the 64GB phone as well as providing me more value.\nIn summary, I am a price sensitive consumer who is looking for performance and value. No doubt that other phones could have meet this criteria with other trade offs, but I am happy with my purchase of a 64GB Asus Zenphone 2 (ZE551ML-23-4G64GN). Application performance and basic phone calls have met my expectations.", "time": "07-24-2015 12:57 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4572979", "text": "Found your review interesting as I am a new user of the Zenfone and also came from a nexus 4 my first smartphone. Loved my Nexus 4 and only made the move do to my stupidity in taking the N4 with me in my pocket for a swim. I had to buy in a hurry and went with the Zenfone after reading lots of reviews. I wanted a screen at least as big as the Nexus and would have preferred the same size but felt the physical dimensions were only slightly larger. Price was a major consideration and went with the $199.99 16gb as my N4 was only 8gb and I really had no problems. With the micro sd card slot the Zenfone has lots of capacity for me.\nI find the Z2 to be as fast as my N4. The screen seems not as sharp in resolution as I recall the N4 but it is larger 5.5 vs 4.7\nButtons to me are superior by far to my N4. Was always hitting the volume by accident as I held it or turned it on. Much prefer the top button and back volumes. Sound to me is about the same.\nI purchased a Ringke FUSION  case for the phone. Had the same one on my N4. I like the additional protection it provides against edge drops and it is very thin and being clear does not alter the phones look.\nCamera is okay for regular photos which I find sharper than the N4 but videos are not nearly as good which is to bad but I don't use that much.\nThe Capacitive buttons are not that bad even though not lit you know where they are. Not sure why as my N4 is toast and cannot compare but I find when typing I seem to hit the home key in error when going for the space key. Never happened with my N4 so assume it is much closer to the keyboard.\nI am not a fan at all of the bloatware which cannot be removed really unless you root the device and few can be disabled properly. Sure if you don't use it you can ignore it but it is taking up Ram and pops up from time to time and you get the constant updates. I guess you just have to live with it.\nI wish the google screen page which opened with a swipe up from the bottom would work as easy as it did on the N4 but it is slow as I need to press and hold the home button and then swipe up on the Zenfone. My samsung tablet is even better as just a press and hold of the home button activates it\nHaving dual sim slots and an sd card slot are major improvements to me over the N4\nBattery life seems better also to me but I have seen others say it is worse. Doesn't charge as fast but I do an overnight anyway so not a problem\nThe negatives to this phone to me are few especially considering the price.", "time": "07-25-2015 02:34 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4573638", "text": "ggt1 - Sorry to hear about your wet Nexus 4. Some follow up to your comments:\n* \"when typing I seem to hit the home key in error when going for the space key\" - I had same thing happen a few times when I first used the phone. The default keyboards of each device have a slightly different layout. Nexus 4 space key is a little wider but also a little shorter in height (keyboard on the N4 is compressed overall in comparison), so in practice the Z2 home key should be easier to avoid. I think the error is caused by a combination of the home key is not being backlit, and the individual letters being taller. So as you try to adjust from your Nexus keyboard muscle memory you may occasionally overshoot, but soon you will adjust.\n* I have not sorted through the Asus background apps yet. I believe they can be marked so that they do not to start. Even though their notifications can be annoying at times, I did get a useful message from one telling me that facebook was using a lot of CPU. I only installed fb, I have never logged into it, so was surprised it was exhibiting performance problems.\n* I also miss launching google Now from a simple home button up-swipe. Holding the button for a moment before swiping is not a big deal, but sometimes these small things matter. Especially when the Zenfones \"Manage Home\" screen is easily accessed by pressing on any empty screen space. \n* Later on you may want to consider a rapid charger upgrade.

Since the letters are larger, I find the Zenfone easier to use and the extra row of numbers is a big plus, but others may certainly feel differently.

The pixels race was great when we were using qHD screens, but things have gotten ridiculous on the top end, in my opinion. \nThe phone itself is fast, responsive, etc. Zero complaints in this area. Apps rarely fall out of memory with 4GB to work with. \nThe camera is decent. Nothing earth shattering, but for what I use it for it works. Video quality is sub-par, but compared to other phones in this price range (assuming the 16GB model behaves the same) it's still better than average. \nThere have been a few bugs I've run into. I don't get audio notifications over bluetooth when I'm listening to music or podcasts. Something went weird with my widgets as well and now clicking on things inside widgets (say an email in the gmail widget) eventually crashes the launcher. \nMy only really significant complaint has been battery life. It's not great. I could probably make it through a full day of medium use on most days, but drainage is a significant problem. Fortunately quick charging lives up to its name. I typically charge on my 45 minute commute home and have 90+% when I get home. On days where I'm not spending time next to a charger, however, things can be a bit painful.

[{"title": "My Experience with the Zenfone 2 so far", "thread": [{"postID": "post4495836", "text": "So I have had this phone for about a month, and there are somethings I like and dislike, but overall I really like the phone!Size/Physical Appearance\nSo this is my first phone with a button on the back, and its actually really not that bad at all. I know a lot of previous reviewers had an issue with a back button, but you get used to it really quick. The size of the phone is actually kinda big for one handed use, and it does get a but annoying trying to swipe down the notification bar with one had. I do have NOVA which I have created a swipe down gesture, but I can see it being annoying for some people. Overall, I think the phone looks pretty nice. \nI'd rate an 8/10Display\nThe display on this phone is actually pretty good. Visible in bright daylight with no problem. The display is not as good as the S6, but its comparable to other phones for sure. I think this phone has naturally better colors than the S6, because the S6 display is more warm (has a subtle orange tine), whereas this is more natural, especially the whites. This phone does a some themes to change the UI, and they are actually quite good. Not that much of a variety, but I'm sure more will come later. \nI'd rate an 8/10Sound\nNow this is one area where the phone falls short. The back speaker on this phone is not loud at all. In fact, even at full volume of playing music, at times it may be a bit muffled. If you have a high quality sound file on the phone, it sounds better, but still not too loud. Now don't get me wrong, its not so quiet that you wouldn't hear it at all, but you may not hear the phone ring if you left the phone in the other room.\nThe sound with headphones on this phone is also not really good when compared to other devices. I have played the same song with headphones on my S6, and on the Zenfone 2, and the difference is quite noticeable. The Zenfone sounds more like the treble has been boosted up and bass driven down. Sure there is an equalizer in the stock music player, but it really doesnt help much at all. Now im not sure if this specific problem is with my phones, but sometimes I would listen to music on the headphones, and the bass is completely gone. I would play the same song on my S6 and the music is full, but quite opposite on the Zenfone 2. It is only after I restart the Zenfone 2 that the sound fixes itself. Seems like a bug to me \nI's rate this a 6/10Performance/Speed\nThis is where this phone shines. When I say this phone is fast, I mean fast. The 4GB of ram really does justice with this phone. There is no lag, no stutter, no slowdowns, no anything. I have about 5 different games on my phone, and I switch between them, as well as other apps, and it works really well with no stutter in between. I can even say this phone performs better than the S6 in terms of speed, but its probably because of the 4GB of ram.\nI'd rate this a 10/10Camera\nThe camera is usually one of the most important features of a phone to me, and the Zenfone 2 I can say will not be my daily camera driver. The camera is not exceptional. It is not really an \"above average\" camera when compared to the latest smartphones. However, it does have some good points. The macro mode on this phone is actually pretty good and works well. I am able to get close and focus on a point with ease and no problems. When taking a photo in daylight, the photo will be good but it depends on how u position the camera. One wrong position and you will get a backlight so bright you would think you took the picture in heaven. I don't thine the colors are truly accurate after taking a picture. It will either oversaturate a bit, or will under saturate and make the picture look like there is an Instagram filter on it. The camera has a lot of modes. Some will be useful some will not be. However, one of the great modes is the low light mode. Although there will be some noise after taking a pic, it will turn a dark room into one that looks like 5 lamps are on. In other words, it works really well!\nThe front camera is really not too great either. When compared to the S6, there is not much light being drawn in (thanks to the S6's F1.9 aperture) There difference is quite clear actually. I would call it a near-average camera, but certainly not above average\nYou can see my sample pics here: http://forums.androidcentral.com/asu...ml#post4468755\nI'd rate this a 6/10Battery\nSo the Zenfone 2 has a non-remoable battery, but does have a removable back cover. I am actually quite impressed with this battery. This certainly lasts me more than a whole day. I do everything on this phone from listen to music, to play games, to check FB, to read news. I have my phone on auto-brightness, but the battery does last quite long. I would say if I were to use the S6 and the Zenfone 2 the exact same way, the Zenfone 2 would probably last longer, but it does have a bigger battery.\nThis phone does have power saving modes. Ultra Power Saving Mode is pretty cool, but it mostly changes thing in the background, such as lowered performance and limiting background running apps. It is not like the S6 where it will change the whole display black and white, or change it to a completely different interface. I would say that this may not be needed much since the phone does last quite a while.\nI'd rate this a 9/10\n______________\nQuick Summary\nPros\n- Great display\n- Great Battery\n- Fast fast fast\nCons\n- Camera is no on par with other phones (both front and back)\n- Back speaker sound is not loud\n- Headphone sound is not too goodOverall Rating: 8/10", "time": "06-15-2015 10:11 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4495910", "text": "Great review!

The cover is much too hard for me to get off so I use the flip case. The flip case is not easy to get off either, but it is a bit easier than the glued-shut back cover. Being forced to use this flip case rather than the case I purchased and some glass has left me with a bad impression. \nI started a separate thread regarding the back cover. Had I purchased this phone, it would have gone back as defective. Someone said it would be better to have a tight cover than one that slips off too easily. I have personally never had that problem with any back cover. My Note cover comes off with ease and it never comes off on its own. \nThe phone feels ok, though I cannot really tell because of the flip cover. The phone is not as heavy as my Note and it is a bit smaller. The power button on the top and the volume rocker on the back are both a bit awkward. I do not like that the capacitive buttons do not illuminate. I think this was a dumb move on the part of Asus. What would have been the harm in lighting up those buttons? This is a big knock on the phone as far as I am concerned. \nI am not overly impressed with the look of the phone. Even my husband, who is not crazy about the white color of my Note, thinks my Note is more attractive than the Zen. I personally love white phones. \nBattery: \nThe battery life is good. I do charge my phones every night, so I have not let it drain to see how long it will last. It has better battery usage then my Note, which has suffered some since Lollipop. For instance, I have been using the two phones equally today. I have used 31 percent battery in five hours with my Note, with an estimated 13:50 hours remaining and 53 percent app usage. The Zen in five hours has used 27 percent battery, 53 percent app usage and 26 hours left. I am not sure how the remaining hours are so much more, but this info comes from the GSam battery app. The screen time has been the same on both, 52 minutes. \nMy average per complete charge battery life on the Note is 17 hours, screen on 3 hours, 33 minutes. The Zen is 22 hours, screen time 3 hours, 26 minutes. \nCalling: \nThe calls I have made on this phone were good and mostly clear. I have HD calling with my Note and calls made to other HD calling phones are outstanding. The HD calling cannot be beat for clarity. \nDisplay: \nThis display just does not pop like my Note. If I try to use \u201cauto\u201d it is much darker than auto on my Note. I use Vivid on the Zen but its colors are still not as nice\nPhotos: \nThe Note does a much better job with photos in all different lights. I have not played with the camera settings in the Zen, because I do not play with them with the Note. I am one who wants to rely on auto, although I realize the value in the various camera settings on both the Note and the Zen. \nDownloading: \nI also posted a separate thread on downloading. The downloading has been a mixed bag. Sometimes downloading is fast, sometimes not. Apps open as fast as on my Note but downloaded content does not always come up as quickly. The Zen is definitely not as reliable as the Note. \nWi-Fi: \nThe speeds I get through Speedtest are not as fast as they are with my Note, but my Note kicks **** on Wi-Fi. It kicks my husband\u2019s Droid Turbo like a can down the road when it comes to Wi-Fi speeds. (He always beats me though on 4g).\nData: \nThis is a mixed bag as well with the Zen and T-Mobile. In my house, T-Mobile does not get 4g. Outside the house in an area where the 4g is super bad with Verizon, the Zen T-Mobile gets 20 mbps versus Verizon\u2019s not even 1 mbps of speed. In another part of town, Verizon got 18 mbps and the T-Mobile got 3.92 mbps speed. This morning in the house, my Verizon Note on data got 7.28 mbps and the T-Mobile Zen got 2.82 mbps speed. \nBluetooth: \nBluetooth seems to work fine.\nGPS: \nSeems to work fine. It is even smart locked to my home location. \nPrice: \nThe price is good for this phone. It is half the price as my Note, which is why it lacks in display, camera, and overall reliability. If one is on a strict budget and not with Verizon or Sprint, this is a good phone. If one is not on a strict budget, it is still a good phone but keep looking because there are better overall phones. \nOverall:\nIf I were buying a phone, this would not be my first choice. I tend to go for the highest end phones, so this is not a knock on this phone. It is just a personal preference. \nIt is not compatible with Verizon and I am a Verizon customer, making it not feasible for me to purchase this phone. That said the phone is a good value with great specs. This phone is not slow and does not lag. It is quite snappy. I would love a Verizon phone with double sim capabilities. That is a real plus with this phone. The 64 gbs of internal phone storage is also awesome. \nI love the double tap to turn on the screen. I also like some other features that do not come with my Note, such as multiple users. The 100 free gbs of Google Drive was also an amazing benefit with this phone.", "time": "06-06-2015 02:04 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4476340", "text": "Once you pick up the phone, how can you not know where the buttons are?

I was one of the winners selected on this forum to receive a free review unit of the ASUS Zenfone 2 (the highest-end ZE551ML model). I may post more in the future, but I wanted to post my initial thoughts after using this phone for two weeks. Here I go!Note: I am quite fortunate to have this phone and I'm very thankful -- If I say anything negative, it's not to complain but to write an informative, critical review.First Impressions\nAfter taking the phone out of the box, my first impressions were \"Wow, this thing is huge\" and \"Wow, this thing is beautiful!\" I'll speak more to the size later, but the device is an eye-catcher. It certainly doesn't possess the built quality of something like an HTC One, but at less than half the price I didn't expect it to. I was, however, pleasantly surprised at how nice the front glass appears, and while the back plastic piece certainly isn't brushed aluminum, it gives the device a nice aesthetic (especially compared to other plastic-backed smartphones on the market). In my opinion, the phone does a great job of being a \"budget\" phone without looking like it at all. As soon as I fired her up, my eyes were delighted by the display. At 1080p, this 5.5\" display is as pixel-dense as I think I could ever need. I'm no connoisseur of displays, but to my eyes viewing angles, brightness, and colors look good. This phone definitely has an eye-candy factor for me. But there's more to a phone than just looks, so let's get to the user experience.Size and Button Placement\nAs I first held the phone, I doubted that I would be able to use the phone effectively with just one hand. It's big -- so big, that I was having trouble reaching the four corners of the touchscreen without stretching quite a bit. The curvature of the back helps a lot; it makes the similarly-sized iPhone 6 Plus feel extremely box-like and unnatural in comparison, but I wasn't sure that the curve would be enough. Having to use the phone two-handed all the time would be a deal breaker for me. This brought me to ask myself, \"What is the ideal screen size?\" To me (and probably many others), the best screen size is the largest I can get while still being able to effectively use the device one-handed. After using the phone for two weeks, I've gotta say that ASUS has nailed that size! I have pretty average-sized hands, and while it definitely took a little while to get used to a device of this size, I can now comfortably use the device one handed. Yes, that's right -- I get to have my cake and eat it too -- a big, beautiful 5.5\" display that I can use one-handed. I found that I was using the same grip-style that I would use for a smaller device with my pinkie finger below the phone. This limited my thumb mobility a lot. Once I adjusted to a more loose, fingers-resting-on-the-back grip it became much easier to reach everything on screen. Because of the curve, the grip is natural and secure. While this may not be the case for ALL users (e.g. my small-handed sister), I think the majority of people would find this device much more usable than they might think.\nThe size is great for things like videos (obviously), but it's also incredibly helpful in the sheer amount of things that can be seen on screen at once. Every time I see the average Joe's iPhone now, I cringe at the amount of cramped screen elements. The Zenfone makes the tiny-smartphone form factor look plain silly, and I don't think I'll be going back to anything that size again.\nA lot of discussion has gone up about the phone's physical buttons. All I have to say is this: they're not where I would put them if I designed the phone, but they're not really an inconvenience to me either. As many have noted, the lock button has a sticky, mushy feel with little tactile response. I hope it's improved with ASUS' future phones, but it's not that big of a deal to me. I use the double-tap to wake/sleep far more than I use the button.Sound\nNow we come to what may be my biggest issue with this phone: sound. As far as I can tell, the phone mic/speakers are good, but the loudspeaker on this phone is just not optimal. The speaker is on the back of the phone, and while it isn't the world's worst speaker, it may be in the world's worst location. When consuming media on this big, beautiful display, you'll either need to wear headphones or listen to the sound of your speaker projecting sound out into the room, bouncing off something, and coming back to your ears. Cupping your hand around the speaker is pretty difficult to do because of its placement. They aren't so bad if you're just listening to music with the phone face down, but for watching videos (especially in a loud environment) they're disappointing. It just comes down to the simple fact that speakers sound better when they are pointed at the listener. I envy the front-facing speakers of something like an HTC One -- the difference is remarkable. I hope ASUS can implement a similar design in the future.Performance, OS/Skin, and Camera\nThe phone is snappy. I have noticed very small amounts of lag before certain animations happen on screen, but for the most part it's very smooth and responsive. This is the first time I've ever used an Android device long-term (I know, I know), but I've loved the experience. The back button is great on a phone this size because reaching to the top left corner every time you want to go back is inconvenient. It makes iOS seem stupid for not having it. There's definitely a fair share of pre-installed crapware and irremovable unnecessary apps, but as far as I know they don't impact performance in a major way. I'd like to see the fat here trimmed next time around. Since this is my first android device, I can't really comment on ZenUI versus other skins or stock, but I can say it's mostly good. ASUS has some useful features deep in the settings, too. The cameras are good enough for me, though the included camera app has some quirks and not-so-user-friendly menus. If you want super in-depth analysis on the camera, go read someone else's review, and if you really want a great camera I'd suggest buying a camera instead of a cell phone.Battery Life and Charging\nThe Zenfone's battery lasts me all day, and that's all I really need. I haven't tested battery life very extensively, but maybe I can update later with more information. One of the hidden gems of this phone is the fact that it supports ASUS' \"Boostmaster\" quick charging technology - with the right charger (like the one included), you can go from 0% to 60% battery in less than an hour. This feature is very useful when you're low on juice and you only have a short time before you need to leave the outlet again. I even picked up a quick charger for my car. I still charge my phone at night with a regular, non-quick charge adapter though in hopes to extend the life of the battery over time.Final Thoughts\nWhile ASUS may have made some \"phone market amateur\" mistakes with this device, I'm glad they made this phone.  I've loved using it, and if I wasn't given this review unit then I'd go buy one. To me, this phone performs as well or better than many phones above its price bracket. With lower-end models even cheaper, ASUS is helping make smartphones much more affordable and making contracts less attractive. If you have any questions about things I missed, let me know and I'd be happy to answer.

Android Device Manager is already built into your phone and has been from the beginning (and is also on any current updated Android phone). You can set ADM settings in the Google Settings app and make sure it is checked under Device Administrators in your Security settings. You can then use it remotely by going to Device Manager while signed into your google account - https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager - or by installing the ADM app on another phone and signing in under your account. You do not need the app on your phone - it is only needed if you want to use a different phone to find your phone, lock, or erase. Or just use the web browser link I posted above.\nNow the kill switch part. There is no special setting for it. It is implemented automatically as long as you have a lock method set of the proper security level and you have a google account on your phone. That is why after the update you are prompted for a PIN to be set. You can remove your lock screen security and then the kill switch will be disabled. As long as a PIN/password/(possibly also pattern lock) is set and you have a google account associated with it, the kill switch will be turned on.\nWith the kill switch on, the user will need to know your google sign in info to be able to use the phone. If they factory reset it to get around the PIN or if your remotely factory reset it to wipe the data, then after the reset they will be prompted for your google username and password and will not be able to continue without signing into your account. With the kill switch off, they can factory reset and do whatever they want with the phone.\nAs far as India or other countries, if you have the same firmware installed that has the function then it should work the same.", "time": "07-03-2015 02:21 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4533415", "text": "Thanks a lot for the info.

I started with a fresh boot and 100% power at 7 am this morning. The weekends are usually light days for me, so I had to try to use my phone a lot to get 4 hours of on screen time. \nI owned a OnePlus One for about 6 months and at the time it was being called the \"Flagship Killer\" because of it's impressive spec sheet and customizability. It was indeed a nice device and at $350 an unheard of bargain in the world of $600 to $800 flagship devices. I knew ASUS through my Nexus 7 2012 and it was an impressive little tablet in it's day. The Zenfone 2 continues on that path of an extraordinary value. \nI was able to put the Zenfone 2 through it's paces today and tried to use as many of the features as I could to see if it could be my daily driver among other impressive flagships that I have: Nexus 6, iPhone 6+, Galaxy S6. I used NFC, Bluetooth in my car, casting youtube onto my Samsung smart TV and phone calls, emails, texts, apps, etc. The short answer is the hardware is top notch and the Zen UI is very smooth and remarkable in it's usefulness. It is nowhere as buggy as my OPO was where we would wait for new updates to fix whatever got broken in the last update...Yes, this could very easily be my daily driver and has caused me to question the 700+ I spent on the Nexus 6 last November not to mention my 6+...\nI have some NFC tags I have used for years at home, car, keychain. I download the app, trigger, and without setting up anything the tags all work fine and carry out their appointed tasks. Connecting the bluetooth to my vehicle was equally easy. The bluetooth worked fine without a hitch which is not always the case i.e. my iPhone 6+ was borked on the bluetooth when new until apple send out a quick update. I was able to cast youtube videos of Vet Ranch (my daughters favorite) onto our Samsung TV and it was as flawless as my Galaxy S6 which is made to connect to their TVs. Everything I did on the device worked well. Themes, icon packs etc all worked without a hitch. I commend ASUS on such a clean UI build. I have already mentioned all the handy built in short cuts which work well. \nThe camera is fine. I have been using a Galaxy S6 for weeks so it skews my impressions because it is the best camera I have used on a smart phone. The Zenfone 2 camera is pretty good also. Outdoors it is very good and indoors it is average. If a camera is the number one criteria for a smartphone then this is not your device. If a nice, dependable shooter will work for you then the Zenfone 2 is on your short list...factor in the $300 for the top model, and it may be at the top of your list. \nI am posting my battery stats after a 14 hour day. This is the first full day of use. YMMV as we all know. I have the power saver set to customize (100% of screen setting) and ultra saving mode to kick in at 15% remaining battery. The screen is set to about 60% manually. Full sync and no social media.\nThe Zenfone 2 is this years \"Flagship Killer\"! It really is a very competent device in many ways.

I've been using the Asus Zenfone 2 for over 3 weeks now, and I gotta say, it's pretty amazing...especially for the price. Maybe part of it has to do with the fact that my previous phone was a first gen Moto G. But even then, I know in my heart that there is still room for improvement! \nWhat brings me joy:\n1) Speed - It's so fast...from turning on, turning off, to rebooting. No issues whatsoever. I also like how there's a boost option on the dropdown menu to help clear out some space. \n2) Appearance -I love how the back is curved, making it easy to hold in my hand. The chrome-style hairline chassis gives it a classy look despite the fact that it is indeed plastic. I've read mixed reviews about the display, but I think it's beeeautiful. It may not be some LED looking device, but the colors are vivid and game graphics look great. \n3) The boost-charging works as advertised - For a smartphone battery, I'd say this one dies quickly. I was stuck in jury duty the other week for about 5 hours. By hour 3 I was struggling to keep it alive. Yeah, I did play Mortal Kombat for a good bit (like an hour or so) , but still... it went down to about 10%, and I needed the GPS to take me home. When I got home, it was at 3%. So I stuck it in the charger for 30 minutes and Bam! 40%. It was magic.\n4) The camera works very well in broad daylight. The colors aren't washed out, but are actually nicely exaggerated.Attachment 183123Attachment 183124\n5) The Built-in weather widget - This may not wow any of you, but I love how it tells me the UV rating for the day. Being Asian, I don't tan very well at all. And I have to be extra careful when going outside and wearing sunscreen or I'll start sizzling..\n6) PC link - For a while, I couldn't think of any reason this would be beneficial to me. But I really like to use it when I'm doing work on the computer and you want respond to texts at the same time. This way, you don't have to keep grabbing your phone every second. You just reply right on the computer screen.\nWhat I think Asus can improve on for the next gen:\n1) The power and volume buttons placement - feels totally awkward. For phablet this size, I would definitely prefer side buttons.\n2) Battery life - it discharges quickly. Would like to see if they can make it where you don't have to charge it every day. I personally have to charge twice a day just from periodically checking social media, emails, and web browsing.\n3) The Low light Camera Setting turned out to NOT be the answer to my prayers. I tried..really hard to make it work, but to me it simply brightens the image, and the quality is not presentable at all. \nHere is a picture of my sushi dinner where the table was lit by a single candleAttachment 183131\nHere, the cheesecake is visible, but not super vivid. Attachment 183132\nI guess I got hyped over it because that was their main ball pitch. And unfortunately, it did not deliver for me \nFor $299, you can't beat this phone. However, if I were to glance at one that is comparable, I would say the Sony Xperia Z2 packs a punch. For ~$70 more, you get better battery life, better display, and a 20 mp back-facing camera, with the only sacrifice being the 2.2 mp front-facing camera.

I've always seen other members here get picked but for some reason never thought I'd be so lucky. I just feel fortunate and blessed to be picked in a community I love and enjoy spending my free time throughout my hectic day. I love this place and the folks that frequent it....they are the ones that make it special! \nI'm a pretty light to moderate user. Besides texting and talking, I use my device mainly and mostly for music listening. I listen to music on my 1 and a half hour commute to and from work and for my time in the gym 5 days a week. I'd say anywhere between 5 to 7 hours a day. Most of my listening is done from on board MP3 files either internal or on SD card. I do surf the web from time to time and lately been using the AC forums app quite a bit. I'm not much of a streamer (music/videos) but I do watch an occasional video here and there if I'm going through the news highlights on flipboard. Otherwise, I try not to use my data since its capped.\nThe Asus Zenphone 2 has been a very enjoyable experience for me! Its handled my use very well! I love the look and feel of this device! It feels like a premium device and gets even better with its price point of $299! Its a great package for the amount of money you are spending. A great bang for your buck for sure!HARDWARE\nThe display has been excellent in my use. Although it may be on the lower end of total brightness for me, it has been fantastic to look at! Colors look natural and very pleasing to my eyes when reading text on it. Touch sensitivity has been very good even with a .3mm thick glass screen protector! LG could take a few pointers with touch sensitivity here!\nThe volume buttons were familiar to me coming from an LG G3 (and G4 ). What did annoy me a little was the power button not being in the middle of the up and down volume rocker. Nothing major since I'm used to the placement of LG's devices. Besides, I mainly use the double tap on and off so the power button doesn't bother me much.\nBattery life on the Zenphone 2 was not good out of the box. After fully charging it the first time, I noticed it would lose charge pretty quickly even when idle. This wasn't a good sign for me. It was only after reading on these forum about the 'Auto Start Manager' and disabling everything that my battery life improved! I think Asus should disable everything out of the box so users can have the best battery life experience as this is important to most users. There are a few other things that I've done to improve battery life and its much better than when I first started using it.\nEar piece is nice and clear. Call quality may be dependant on carrier/service but its been very good with me on T-Mobile. Speaker isn't bad but not great either. Sound is very thin and tinny....not really a full sound coming from it. They could of used better speaker for a little better sound. I know some users find this important. Speaker is only important to me when getting calls and I can hear it very well in all its tinny glory!\nBluetooth is good! It was paired with every BT device I have. Sounds good too. No problems here. \nNow here is what I REALLY like about the Zenphone 2.....the sound output out of the headphone port is high! Even though I must listen to music at low volume (I have Tinnitus) and mainly/mostly do, the sound I get on my headphones is very strong! It almost sounds like my headphones sound better because of the higher output. I'm going to assume that Asus implemented this in their UI but its nice to have a device with a higher output without any amplification hardware! I don't go past the mid way point on the sound level because its perfectly loud enough for me! \nCamera has many great features which I haven't played with but from the immediate pictures I took for fathers day, they weren't bad. I'm sure if I took more time to learn the features that come with the camera, I could get some cleaner/clearer pictures than the ones I took all mostly on auto modes. I did use the 'owl mode' for inside low light conditions and got much better pictures than without that mode. There is promise here if used correctly!SOFTWARE\nThe Asus UI skin took me a little time to get used to but I like it. Its a refreshing take on Android's Lollipop OS and different than your usual Samsung, HTC, LG, etc.. flavor. It runs smooth without much hiccups. Its pretty polished and visually appealing! Scrolling is fluid and touch sensitivity is excellent. Double tap to turn on and off is so good that it should be implemented on EVERY Android device! Apps open up quickly and run smoothly. \nI only experienced some slow down when playing my Solitaire game which isn't graphic intense but it may due to the processor (Intel Atom). I'm not much of a gamer but I wouldn't be surprised if gamers experienced some problems/issues while running high graphic intense games on the Zenphone 2. Asus may just need to optimize the UI a little better for the Atom so there is still hope for an even more polished experience here!FINAL THOUGHTS...\nThe Asus Zenphone 2 may not be perfect but it has many great qualities that I look for in a device. This is a really good device considering the price. This device was my first to have 64gb on board storage capacity and I LOVE IT!! It makes me feel at ease knowing that I have so much internal space for many things and its just icing on the cake that it also has an option for added memory with an SD card slot! For $299, this phone is top notch and many users who are light to moderate like myself, I know would absolutely love the Asus Zenphone 2! I've already seen a few in the wild here in NYC!  Asus has a winner here and I'm more than happy to recommend it to my friends and family especially the budget conscious who still want a great device!", "time": "06-24-2015 01:46 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4514239", "text": "did you test the 4GB RAM version?", "time": "06-24-2015 02:35 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4514376", "text": "Yes", "time": "06-24-2015 03:44 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4514621", "text": "Nice job on the review!

My prior device being the HTC M8.The Good:Screen: Based solely on how the screen looks, this is very similar to my M8. On my device, whites are very accurate. I have no color tint at all. The icons are very sharp, and crisp.Speakers: For rear facing speakers, they aren't bad. I had streamed music from Google Play and the sound was clear, pleasant to listen to, and after placing it on my desk for a few minutes, I forgot I wasn't listening to the M8.User Input: In regard to touch response, this is fast. For a few days I left all the animations on stock, and it is still a snappy device. Turning the animations down made it a tiny bit faster. I am guessing the 4 GB of RAM helped out here. There were a couple hiccups in the ROM itself, but that was upon initial set up, nothing a reset couldn't fix, and things I haven't seen since.Other: Clear method of rebooting into recovery. Without looking online, I got into recovery quite easily. There were no excessive extra button presses, or combos. No tilting your hand to 35.7 degrees on the right solar zenith on the first Wednesday after the first Tuesday of the month (ok a little extreme on the sarcasm, but I have seen recoveries that are painstaking to get into).Quick Charge: This is my first device that is capable of it. It is a very nice feature to have.Tap to wake: Had this on my M8, and it is so nice! Good move here.The Neutral:Power button: The top center is very cumbersome to use. However, with a screen off widget, I was able to bypass the need to reach it. With the tap to wake, this reduces the need for the power button almost entirely.Back plate: It is nice and tight. Very comforting snap as it sets into place. Conversely, there is a little more effort to remove it than other devices with removable backs that I have used.Recovery speed: Not too surprised after the Nex5 and M8. Cache clear and resets were a little on the slow side, but nothing too surprising. Power button in plate: This doesn't quite sit too well with me. The plate with the button has a small foot, and that presses the actual power area. However, to play Devil's Advocate, this design might be aimed at wear and tear on the button so that it reduces the actual breaking to something easily replaceable.The Bad:Battery: Surprisingly, this is somewhat disappointing. There is a 3,000 mAh battery in the ZF2, versus the 2,600 mAh in the M8. My M8 is showing it's age in terms of battery, meaning I am starting to notice some degradation, and my M8 lasts as long as the ZF2, doing roughly the same activities. Devil's Advocate on this though is I can make it through a roughly 13 hour day and not need to rush to a charger. I am however, a Medium light user. Very few video intense games, and my screen time is a couple hours.Kernel: Looking at GSAM battery stats, the Kernel is working overtime. I am inclined to believe this is part of the under performance in the battery. I am also inclined to believe part of this is related to the Intel chip.The Ugly:Hardware buttons: I am not against these, although it has been a while since I have used a device with them. They do not illuminate, which is not fun in lower light situations. Response of the buttons is hit and miss. It almost seems like the sweet spot is quite small.Summary:\nFor someone reading this looking to get an overview of this device, something to keep in mind is this device is priced at $300 at most. No contract, just a straight $300, and you have a very solid device. A low price like this and you have:\n-A respectable amount of storage\n-A higher end chipset, regardless of the power drain\n-A relatively up to date version of Android out of the box\nThis is a device that has some room for improvement, but it isn't horrible out of the box. Would I suggest this as a daily driver? Probably not, depending on your use. As for emerging markets, this might be the overall goal of the ZenFone. Is it a good backup device? Very. I can easily see this as a solid backup device.I really wanted to love this device. I can see so much potential for it. I think once ASUS can figure out the kernel issues, it can be a stellar device for the price point. I was ecstatic upon unboxing it, and the first few days I had to remind myself that the battery needed to break in. It did take a little over a week before seeing some battery improvements, and realizing it was the same type of battery as the M8, I automatically ignored the battery life until last Monday.", "time": "06-12-2015 09:56 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4490211", "text": "Note: This is on the 4GB/64GB Internal Storage version with the 18W Charger included in the box.The Good:Fast - This thing is pretty fast. I was actually kind of stunned on how fast it was out of the box. The hardware specs do not lie even though it is priced as a \"mid-range\" device. I was able to go through daily tasks without much hassle at all. It flew threw my apps, my heavy streaming sessions, and my duties that I perform here on AC (either the app or in Chrome).Battery Charge Speed - WOW. It takes Quick Charge to another level. I was able to consistently get my device full in 30 mins or less (depending how low I got it). The fastest I saw was a 40 min charge where it went from 2% to 100%. This will definitely be useful for those times you need a quick boost in juice and don't have a lot of time.Screen - The screen on this is very nice. I was able to enjoy all the content I watch and when turning up to full brightness it was more than adequate to watch my shows on it.Updates - Odd pro huh? It reminds me of a Nexus in a way. In the time I have had this phone it has already received 2 OTA updates. That shows the ASUS is committed to squashing bugs and pushing the updates to us ASAP.The Bad:Battery Charge Rate - I get what you're saying .. But you said this was a PRO.. it is but it is also a CON at the same time. The pro side is this thing can fly through a charge in no time but the con part is the heat. When charging the device GSam would record 120-122 degrees Fahrenheit which I think is a tad too hot for batteries to get to every time they charge. I worry after using the phone for an extended time you will need to replace the battery due to heat damage.. and since the battery is stuck in there this would mean a repair shop or sending it into ASUS.App Compatibility - This can change with time but right now most of my video apps didn't work. I was able to watch some shows by placing them on the device themselves but things like my Xfinity app didn't work. Actually most show apps didn't. I assume in a little while the developers will update this but at the moment it hurts for people who use that.Battery Life (not related to charging) - The battery life on this device is \"OK\". It isn't horrible but it isn't great either. For my device idle time was fine (I even had as low at 0.7% an hour) but once that screen was on ... say good-bye to the battery! I could get about 2-3 hours of SoT before it hit rock bottom. Bad? No but now a days a lot of people enjoy more SoT so they can use their phone heavily and last an entire day at the same time. The charge time (listed in the \"PRO\" section) could help fight this for those who do have access to a charger throughout the day.Cache / Reset Speed - As Golfdriver said .. The cache wipes and FDR (Factory Data Resets) take a little longer than they should. I did a FDR the other night and it took about 20 min + to fully erase everything and reboot back to the \"Welcome\" screen I saw when I first got the phone. Not sure what caused it to take a long time since I didn't have that much on the phone (maybe 10 GB of shows then apps .. and I had the 64GB Version).Lock Button Placement - This one can be tossed as a \"meh\" more than bad. For me it was really annoying though. The lock button being on the very top of such a tall device can make it a pain for locking. Unlocking the phone is a breeze with the double tap to wake it up but once I wanted to lock it / put it in my pocket... UGGGHHH!Summary\nAll in all -- Would I recommend this phone to someone? Yes - depending on the user. For a $300 phone (4GB/64GB Variant) you can't really complain. I mean... we could but it isn't fair to compare it to a $700 retail phone and wonder why it doesn't perform exactly like that other expensive phone. The phone performs very well and is snappy when going through the UI and daily tasks.\nIf you're a heavy user you will notice the battery drain pretty rapidly. It just depends on your needs if this is a deal breaker or not (I know not all of us can charge during the day). I would recommend this phone to someone who is on a budget but wants a phone that is close to the other \"top phones\" -- As long as they accept a few of its short-comings.", "time": "06-12-2015 02:34 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4499038", "text": "I have to agree and should add to my thread, this is a $300 phone, its not a $1000 Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, that said if you look at a Samsung Galaxy J1 which is in the price range of $235 retail this is what you get Samsung Galaxy J1 - Full phone specifications\n4GB of ROM\n512MB RAM\n480x480 display\nDoes this sound appealing to you, thought so.

This is the model with the 2.3 GHz quad core Intel Z3580, full HD display, 4 GB RAM, and 64 GB internal storage, which normally retails for $299.Pros:Frequent system updates, which means ASUS is paying attention and listening to feedback. To date, I\u2019ve gotten 4 system updates in the span of about 6 weeks. An added bonus is that you can easily see the detailed release notes for system updates in the ZenTalk Forums, which ASUS includes as a preinstalled \u201capp\u201d (which is actually just a browser link).ZenUI has nice customization options. Compatible with all standard icon packs, as well as limited theming. There are many options for homescreen appearance, transitions, Quick Settings toggles (including a Mobile Data toggle--more manufacturers need to include this!), and the app drawer. The interface is generally very smooth. I find myself not missing the Google Now Launcher.Performance is generally good, as long as power saving mode is set to Performance. No real lag in this mode. But if you set it to Balanced Mode, then some UI jerkiness becomes noticeable.So much RAM, so much storage! 4 GB of RAM seems way more than enough (although it\u2019s not a guarantee that recent apps you were using won\u2019t close out of RAM when you switch apps--I see this happen with MLB At Bat, for one). Having 64 GB of Internal Storage (actually 54 GB free after accounting for OS and nonremovable bloat) along with a microSD for media storage should satisfy all but the most demanding user.The presence of a microSD slot should make many users happy. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t corrupt cards easily. The phone also allows the user to \u201cmove apps to SD\u201d (which of course only means a portion of the app).Good full HD screen, with crisp images and natural colors that aren\u2019t oversaturated. The range of brightness could be wider, though--it seems the lowest brightness is still too bright at night, while the highest brightness still looks a bit dim outdoors.Main speaker has good volume (but no bass whatsoever).Camera is a mixed bag. Daytime shots show vivid color. Depth of Field shots are fantastic. Full Manual mode for photo buffs. Plenty of other modes that I never use. Focus is reasonably quick, although I\u2019ve seen quicker. Also see Cons.  Double tap to wake is a popular feature, but can accidentally wake screen when in pocket. Other touch gestures may be useful--you can program certain drawing gestures to launch specific apps. There\u2019s a one-handed mode for those with smaller hands, which reduces the size of the screen and offsets it to one side.Build quality is good. The phone has a nice heft, but doesn\u2019t feel heavy or bulky. No danger of torquing or bending. I was afraid that it would be too big of a phone for the pocket, but it actually fits nicely in my front pants pocket.Able to access stock recovery and wipe cache easily (takes 5-10 min, like the Nexus 5).Dual SIM, for those into that kind of thing.ASUS Cover allows for a windowed flipcover case to show various information in the circular window while the cover is closed, like Samsung\u2019s S-View case.Quick Charging works very well, usually taking about an hour to charge from around 30% to full. This offsets some of the battery gripes I have (see Cons).Cons:Soooo much ASUS bloat that can\u2019t be removed, and a lot of it can\u2019t be disabled. Granted, some of these apps are actually pretty good, but I still don\u2019t use the vast majority of them.ASUS EmailASUS Do It Later (an odd task deferral app, not sure of its utility)Share LinkASUS CalendarASUS Splendid (screen color optimizer)ASUS CameraASUS BrowserASUS WeatherASUS Sound RecorderASUS File Manager (decent)ASUS Quick Memo (can share to your Google account, but doesn\u2019t sync)ASUS GalleryASUS CalculatorMiniMovie-Slideshow MakerASUS KeyboardASUS What\u2019s Next (multifunction agenda, only integrates with ASUS apps)ASUS PC Link (mirrors phone on PC)ASUS FlashlightASUS MusicASUS SuperNote (Quick Memo and SuperNote?)(also doesn\u2019t sync with Google)ASUS BackupASUS SupportASUS PhotoCollageASUS ZenCircle (ASUS trying to create some new social photo sharing network)CleanMaster preinstalled? Really? At least it can actually be removed, and not just disabled.And what the heck is Dr. Safety? Also removable.Android OS battery drain. This is what is keeping the phone from being truly great. It routinely accounts for 30-40% of total battery usage by the time the battery itself is down to around 30%--that means it\u2019s responsible for half or more of all battery usage. I never saw this on the Nexus 5. The Zenfone 2 typically drains 2-3% per hour on idle, which is significantly worse than the Nexus 5. Screen-on time is usually about 3.5 hours at best (Nexus 5 with its weak battery was usually around 2.5 hrs), but the idle drain means I still have to recharge each night. Asus has pushed 4 system updates since I got the phone--the first 3 didn\u2019t address this issue, but the 4th just got pushed a couple of days ago, so I\u2019m still evaluating it. Stay tuned.No wireless charging. What am I gonna do with my 3 charging pads?Camera--low light photos are generally grainy (1st photo below), which would have been fine if ASUS hadn\u2019t boasted about its low light quality. HDR photos show ghosting, since the two images that are taken in succession to account for the exposure range seem to be taken with too much delay in between (2nd photo below--look at the rope the gibbon is hanging from). HDR processing is also not as good as the Nexus 5--exposures aren't balanced as well (3rd photo below).  Power button is stiff and doesn\u2019t have a nice tactile click, although at least it isn\u2019t easy to press accidentally while in a pocket.Back is overly difficult to pry off. Scratched up the plastic a bit already, using both my nail and a coin. Users report different experiences--some have units where it\u2019s easier to take off.The faux brushed metal finish of the back is slippery and feels cheap. It makes me appreciate the rubberized plastic back of the Nexus 5.Earpiece speaker seems to rattle or vibrate subtly when volume is high.Main speaker has very poor bass.Bluetooth connection can be spotty with my Zenwatch--even when right next to each other, the phone and watch would randomly buzz because of brief disconnection. This didn\u2019t happen with the Nexus 5.Although it\u2019s nice to see that ASUS is paying attention and sending out lots of system updates, it also suggests they rushed things for the initial launch.Nitpicky, I know, but there are some glaring grammatical errors in system menus and messages. For example, \u201cGlove mode: Increase touch sensitivity when you wearing the gloves.\u201dVarious app glitches and force closures at first, including system apps and Google apps. It\u2019s difficult to say if this was due to firmware errors or the Intel processor. Things have been more stable after the multiple system updates.Overall, I would say this is a very good phone, and definitely an excellent value given the $299 price tag, but it just seems that it could be a ridiculously great phone after a few more tweaks and bugfixes. I\u2019m hoping that ASUS continues its diligent updates and ultimately addresses the remaining issues.", "time": "06-20-2015 11:00 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4508714", "text": "Excellent and thorough reviews.

My thoughts on the Zen Fone 2", "thread": [{"postID": "post4498974", "text": "First let me say I review based on my personal preferences and taste, that said you should ALWAYS check things out in person and judge for yourself before deciding to buy or not to buy.\nMy thoughts and use of the ASUS ZenFone 2 and how it is/isn\u2019t working for me on a daily basis.\nSo I was one of the fortunate AC members to get the ASUS ZenFone 2 and was happy to put it through its paces. For those who don\u2019t know me I buy, use, sell and buy, use and sell a lot of phones in a given year. Way too many and I am trying to cut back on it.\nThat said shiny new things do catch my eye and I will say the ASUS ZenFone 2 is a solid phone for many reasons, and not solid in other areas, but they may or may not be as important to you and that is for you to decide.Look, Feel and Overall build:  I got a lot of questions about the phone, a lot of people asking if it was the new LG G4 and I said no its the new ASUS ZenFone 2, in the US many users are not aware that ASUS does phones and I think in time that will change as their product offerings grow.\nI am not afraid to use a metal/plastic and glass phone, a company who harps on \u201cplastic\u201d phones started out with plastic and switched to metal and then offered plastic again. To me (and you as well) the materials used to make the phone are not the key factor, its how well they do or do not hold up.\nI don\u2019t mind the volume rocker on the back, its not my optimal choice but that is a user preference and not a deal breaker, same with the power button the top.\nSolid frame, 1080p display (which frankly is enough for the vast majority of users) and the back cover being plastic is mute, you can remove it and attach a wide array of cases with covers integrated or new back covers. So in terms of build I would say give it a good 9 out of 10. Hardware: Its my first use of a smartphone with an Intel Atom processor and so far its done the job well, played games, email, youtube, etc so no hiccups or issues. 4GB of RAM (top end model) and it comes with task managers (remove move then don\u2019t use them and they shouldn\u2019t be there) with that much RAM you won\u2019t be hurting anytime soon. 64GB ROM + microSD (higher end model again) is a plus and honestly IF this was the standard config on most Android Phones I would be happy. Plenty of space for apps, and a micoSD for media.\nDoes it need a Heart Rate Monitor, fingerprint sensor, not really, would it be nice but do you want to pay $100 more for that, not really and it doesn\u2019t suffer from not having it either.\nOS, Android 5.0 well that is not where it should be given the launch window it should be at least 5.0.2 or above and 5.1.1 should be offered soon (but we don\u2019t know). That said I have ZERO stutters, hiccups, delays, nada compared to other UI/UX overlays (Touch Wiz). The Zen UI is fluid, smooth and just plan works. I commend them for that and give it a 9 out of 10.Sound (or lack there of): This is one area that I am disappointed in, I am not expecting HTC Front Facing Speakers, but, even Samsungs Galaxy series with the speaker on the back had more even sound to them, and I did have my flip cover open. I do not use headphones since I wear hearing aids so I can only speak to speaker quality. I give that a 7 out of 10.Camera: I will say I don\u2019t rely on a phone to be my main camera, I have Nikon and Canon for that. Still I do want pictures to be crisp enough. Based on some simple comparisons between the GS6 Edge, iPhone 6 and the Zen Fone 2 its an average performer, BUT, they do give you 18 different camera modes that can help. My Score 7 out of 10.Battery Life: I travel a lot for work and have a work phone so my personal phone at time sits idle and pulls in email and a few other things like Google Now so it can ride shotgun at times. Yesterday I had Google Now on and it took the battery down from 100% to 55% from 8am to 7pm. Today I had Google Now off and went from 100% to 73% from 8am to 7pm so Google Now can impact but so can cellular coverage etc. I plan on doing a side by side comparison of the ASUS Zen Fone 2 and Galaxy S6 Edge running the same apps, etc and sitting side by side for a day to see how they compare in a 12 hour run this weekend. I will post that up later.\nSo I give battery life a 7 out of 10, its not the worst but its not the tea sipper either.For an overall score I am giving this phone a 7.8 out of 10, based on comparing it to the higher end phones on the market like the GS6 and iPhone 6, etc. I will say if you are comparing this to mid-range devices I would actually rate it much higher closer to a 9 out of 10 given the overall features and performance.\nFor me the Sound and Camera were the two weak points, and even though I don't shot a lot of photos with my phone I do want it to be good enough and I know there are users out there who rely on their camera a lot and listen to audio a lot. That said you can do wonders in post production photo editing, you can use Google\u2019s tools as well.\nThoughts, comments or general questions feel free to ask.", "time": "06-16-2015 06:18 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4499031", "text": "Nice Review!

I\u2019m basing my review off of using a LG G2 alongside of the Zenfone 2. \nAsus (in conjunction with the folks here at Android Central) sent me a silver version along with the Zenfone 2 Flip View Cover Deluxe. My Zenfone 2 has 4gb of RAM, a 2.3 GHz processor and 64gb of storage. I am currently with Verizon (I sometimes call them The Red Devil) and as such I had to use a T-Mobile SIM card. As soon as I removed it from the box, I charged the battery completely \u2013 it actually had 72 percent according to the display when I plugged it in but I wanted a full charge - I didn\u2019t time how long it took to reach full capacity though. Once it was full I turned it on and it booted rather quickly and immediately indicated an update was available. It seems there was an update (192.79mb) ready and it took right about 7 minutes to finish and reboot. I was sitting at my home desk and had full bars of Wi-Fi during the process.\nLike others have mentioned, I went to remove the back and let me tell you \u2013 it was on tight. I was really pulling on the back cover and though for sure I was going to break it but it did come off without any damage. I noticed the back has a larger \u201clip\u201d than other doors I have removed, such as the S3/4/5/ and G2/3. The back is plastic but has a nice feel to it and it has the look of brushed metal. Overall the device has a nice solid build to it. I didn\u2019t\u2019 have any issues with any type of noises, squeaks, etc. I found the Zenfone 2 to feel pretty comfortable in the hand and didn\u2019t feel any sharp edges or anything like that. I stepped away from Samsung after the S5 and have dabbled with LG now for a while and I do like the back placed buttons. Yes, it does take a minute to get used to them but once you do, you\u2019ll like how easy they are. \nThe Zenfone 2 comes with many apps pre-installed and like many of you, I disable and/or remove the ones I wouldn\u2019t have any use for. Asus incorporates \u201cApps4U\u201d and has a few inside the icon such as Clean Master, 50+ Games, Dr. Safety, etc. Pretty easy to disable what you don\u2019t want to use just like with any other Android. The first time you access the app list, you are given a tutorial on how to change, move apps. Again, nothing out of the ordinary here.\nThe display is certainly okay for my old(er) eyes and didn\u2019t see any issues with it. That being said, you can tell the display isn\u2019t as crisp as other higher end devices. The brightness setting usually stays on auto for me but I did crank this one all the way up and while it is bright, it\u2019s not overbearing. That being said, you won\u2019t be able (and I couldn\u2019t) to see the display very well in the sunlight. The back/home/return keys do not light up and while not a deal breaker for me, it is weird not seeing them light up. But if you\u2019ve used Android for some times, you know where they are but if someone was new, I could see this being an issue. The double tap is a nice touch and it was more responsive than the G4. I sometimes have to double tap the G4 many times before it responds but hopefully a tweak will solve that issue. \nCall quality using the ear piece as well as the speakerphone was spot on with zero concerns. No one complained about muffled sound, hard to hear me, or anything along those lines. Verizon has this \u201cHD\u201d calling thing but didn\u2019t see any change from the norm.\nThe Wi-Fi and Data connections were pretty decent and the WI-FI would disconnect and reconnect without issues. I used SpeedTest and the test sent me to a Tallahassee server but I pulled consistent 18-21mb speeds. Granted this is area that is always subjective and dependent on many factors. \nBluetooth connected to my Sony SBH80 and LG Tone without any hiccups or issues. Call quality was good as well. While I like my music my way, the Sony\u2019s are my go to for that, but again you may like something else. I dabbled with the GPS while driving (although I have factory nav in my truck) and it was right on target. I didn\u2019t experience any heating issues or large battery drain but I only used it about thirty minutes. \nBattery life \u2013 another subjective concern. I have always said I do not cripple my device in order to achieve the best possible battery life. I can\u2019t understand the need to turn the brightness down or disable Wi-Fi or anything else to get more life. That being said, I simply make preparations to have an external power source if I know I\u2019m not going to be able to get juice if I need it. More and more manufactures are going with the sealed battery - I\u2019d rather pop in a fresh battery versus charging but that\u2019s the way it is. I was able to get a full day out of a charge. I don\u2019t find myself being a heavy user but I do text and message more than actually calls. I check the weather, news and AC forums throughout the day and will charge while sleeping. Obviously the more you use the device, the quicker the need for more juice. The Droid Turbo I had for a while really rocked the battery!!\nWhile I am not a photo expert by any means, as long as the pic I am taking is in focus is fine by me. A phone camera is not meant to (nor ever will) take the place of a dedicated camera. I found the Zenfone 2 took okay pics but did have a low light issue. They came out okay, but have used other devices where they were better. Most of the pics I take are outdoors, at the beach, etc so I don\u2019t have any issues with it. I normally (okay mostly) have the camera set to \u201cauto\u201d and let it do its thing but I can really see the difference between the Zenfone 2 and the G4. \uf04a \nI think I\u2019ve hit just about everything. I really like the double tap to sleep and wake the device \u2013 this should be a standard on every device. The 100gb storage from Google was a nice touch too.\nOverall, I think Asus has a great phone for their first device. Can it be expanded on? Absolutely. If I used T-Mobile or AT&T as my dedicated carrier, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use this as a daily driver. The price point is good too. \nLet\u2019s see what Asus brings to the table with their next device.\nBy all means, please let me know if you have any questions.", "time": "06-20-2015 12:16 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4506319", "text": "Thanks for the detailed review!\nPosted via my Galaxy S6!", "time": "06-20-2015 12:40 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4506314", "text": "Just wanted to ask u this question....

Honestly, I wanted to purchase the phone anyway because I loved the specs, especially the 4gb of RAM. You see, you can never have enough RAM hehe. \nI have been using the phone for three weeks now and I even took it on vacation with me for four days. First, I wanted to mention that I am coming from a Samsung Galaxy Note II, a phone I have been using since it was released in 2012. I am very fond of that phone but let's face it, it was a dated version of Android and it had gotten laggy and It was time for a factory reset. Now that I have been using the Zenfone 2, I do not see myself going back to the Note II. No way, I love the speediness of the Zenfone 2. This sucker is fast, it's zippy. I love it. Lag is the enemy and I hate it and this phone makes me happy that I no longer have to experience it. \nAt first I wasn't so sure about the battery, you see the Note II has a great battery (3100 mah), it lasts forever, so moving to the Zenfone II and it's 3000 mah battery I was concerned about it's daily performance because I had read negative things about it and even experienced less life than I had been used to -- Until I read about the Auto-Start Manager and now the battery life has been excellent. At least, that's the only thing I can attribute the better battery life to because ever since I turned off a crapload of apps in the auto-start, battery life improved, I was no longer at 30% battery by dinnertime, I was now at 60%. A great improvement.\nI am happy with the screen, I find it bright enough for my liking and I haven't had a problem with it. I love Tap to Wake, I don't think I could live without it after this. I need Tap to Wake on everything now. I found myself tapping on my wife's phone screen wondering why nothing was happening. It's now programmed into my brain. \nOne thing that I was not happy with was the Asus Messenger app, it would not send a photo while on wifi, I had to turn wifi off and switch to Data in order for messenger to send it. That was a pain so I installed Google Messenger and haven't looked back. Google Messenger sends photos just fine. \nDoes anyone else think it's weird that Ringtone and Notification share the same volume, is that normal? I think they should have separate volumes, I like my ringer much louder than my notifications. I don't know, maybe it's just me. \nI used the camera quite a bit while on vacation and outdoor shots looked great and I must say that selfie shots look pretty good too, my Note II always made me look like a hideous chud but the Zenfone 2 makes me look much less chud-like. \nI have been using the Zen UI and I have had a positive experience so far and I am using the ELUN Icon Pack. It's pretty cool looking. I had been using Nova Launcher on my Note II as I was totally sick of Touchwiz. I may go back to Nova but for now I am happy with the Zen UI. I did like being able to remove labels from apps on Nova, it's just cleaner looking. I would love for that option in the Zen UI.\nWhat more can I say about this phone, it's a real bargain, it's only $299! You get a 5.5 inch screen, great speed, a great amount of storage and even an sd card slot. Sure, the speaker doesn't blow you away but I am happy for what it does. Anyone that is sick of paying off their expensive smartphone in tiny increments every month will enjoy the trade off you get with the Zenfone 2. You can own it right now, it's unlocked and it's yours!\nOne thing I would say to Asus is to keep up with the Updates as we all want the latest version of Android on this awesome phone!

I thought that, on paper, it was the most in line with what I\u2019d been looking for in a phone thus far. It claimed to have a massive battery (something other flagships skimped on), competitive camera, and specs to blow anything else out of the water. I have the 5.5\u201d, quad core, 4GB ram, with 64GB of storage. I got mine in the mail two weeks ago and have been using it since. It had 2 updates out of the box, but the majority of my time has been spent with build V2.18.40.12_20150529.Build:\nI\u2019m coming from a long line of well built phones. M8, Nexus 5, Desire Eye, Fire Phone, and now The Zenfone 2. This is the first phone I\u2019ve used in a really long time that has had a plastic removable back. I figured this device would be an obvious step down because of the removable back. After having the phone a couple of weeks, I\u2019m not at all concerned with the removable back cover. That thing is stuck on the phone really well. Like, really, really, really well. To the point where some would say it\u2019s stuck on too tough. I appreciate it, because it\u2019s what I wanted. I don\u2019t do a lot of sim swapping and I have a 64GB memory card hanging out in there, which will take a long time to fill. The plastic on the back is really nice. It has a brushed texture, a bit stickier than the M8 (but then again, what wasn\u2019t\u2026) and so far it\u2019s been pretty durable.\nThe reason I think it\u2019s pretty durable is because I feel the front piece of plastic will be what shows age on this phone. I am usually pretty gentle with my phones. I try to throw them in empty pockets when I can, which works out to be almost always. The last phone I dropped was the Desire Eye, but that was under St. Patrick\u2019s day conditions, and I certainly haven\u2019t dropped this one. With that level of precaution, I\u2019ve still managed to knick up the bottom edge of the Zenfone 2. It seems like this is a much less hard plastic.Hardware:\nThere were a lot of claims about the hardware on the Zenfone. The performance on this thing is amazing. It\u2019s fast. I haven\u2019t once felt like I was challenging anything in it. Between the Intel processor and the 4GB of ram, this phone can handle anything that was built to run on Android. And it will do it at a speed that will blow your socks off. It\u2019s the first device I\u2019m comfortable running a launcher full time on. (I\u2019ll get to the ZenUI in a bit)\nThe camera is good. There are a ton of modes, and they all make a noticeable difference. Auto does a good job. It\u2019s not amazing, but it\u2019s good enough, and I like to put everything I post through snapseed regardless of what phone I\u2019m using. The amazing thing about this phone is the low light mode (not to be confused with night mode). I\u2019m not sure what magic pixel merging entails, but the camera can take surprisingly bright shots in very low light. \nAfter having Boomsound, all speakers are subpar. You can definitely hear stuff on the speaker, but if you want any fidelity, it\u2019d be better to have headphones. Speaking of, in case it makes a difference to you, there are no headphones included in the box.\nWhat is included is a fast charger. Hot damn - you want this feature in your next device. It\u2019s amazing. I could tell you all the numbers, but you still wouldn\u2019t quite get it until you accidentally left your phone unplugged overnight and needed to juice up quick while you ate your Cinnamon Life and showered. My morning routine takes about an hour from alarm to out the door. In that amount of time, I can pump up an extra 70%. That\u2019s a huge percent increase! Not a, \u201ccool, I can make it to my charger at work,\u201d increase, but a, \u201cI should make sure to get this plugged in tonight,\u201d increase. You want this feature. In your car, at your work, and in your house. You want it.\nI have some baby complaints about button placement. I actually had more issues going from the Desire Eye to the Fire Phone, but that button on the top is nowhere near as awesome to reach as the side buttons or the one in the middle of the rocker like the LG phones. The nice compensation is the screen has the tap to wake feature (more on that later). \nBecause speaking of the screen, someone needs to have a serious conversation with Asus about the screen on their phone. Inside, it looks awesome. Full 1080P with great colors. The only problem is that once you go outside, game over. In direct sunlight, it becomes almost unusable. This weekend I did a two day bike ride, and when I went to hand someone my phone to take a picture, they couldn\u2019t figure out how to turn the screen on. The only problem was the screen was on. They just couldn\u2019t see it. This is an issue. I didn\u2019t compare it to any other phone, but I haven\u2019t had that issue in a long time with a phone screen, so I do think it\u2019s something specific to this panel. Perhaps the phone never left the office when they were working on picking out which screen to go with. Whatever lead to this oversight, I think someone at Asus needs to address it really quick.\nOne issue they did address quick was the battery life. I took two updates right out of the box, so I didn\u2019t share the issues that some had with the short battery life. I\u2019ve had my Pebble or Pebble time connected to it almost the whole time I\u2019ve had the phone. I haven\u2019t had it die on me yet, though yesterday I ran it from 5:30 to 10:00 with some pretty heavy use and signal searching and it was at 4% when I finally got it plugged in. It\u2019s been solid. Perhaps not as optimized as the bigger brands who use smaller batteries, but that\u2019s why you put in a big battery, right? It also seems like Asus is only making it better with updates, too. Software:\nI have had a couple of Asus tablets before, so I have an Asus account. I also watched the videos on the new ZenUI. I was ready to finally find a skin that I liked as much as Sense. I tried ZenUI for a while, but I couldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s too much Touchwiz (circa Ice Cream Sandwich) and not enough zen. As soon as I admitted to myself that I couldn\u2019t do ZenUI, I tested a bunch of launchers until I settled on Aviate. It\u2019s much more peaceful and useful. (Asus must be watching my typing because they just notified me that I can download a new theme). I did try a few themes, but in the end, just couldn\u2019t do it, and there wasn\u2019t enough that Asus had done in ZenUI that made it worth keeping. I may have been the only one excited that Asus rumored to be purchasing HTC. I'd love Sense on this device.\nThey did cook in some nice features in other parts of the software. The camera has a zillion shooting modes. It\u2019s actually absurd. With all these modes, the trick is learning when to use each. And you\u2019ll have to learn. It\u2019s really the only way to get exactly what you want, since sometimes you should use night, and sometimes you should use low light, and sometimes auto does a fine enough job. Practice with it to get the right shot, or use something like Snapseed. The camera takes in enough information that you can do some great things in editing.\nThe Touch Gestures redeem any fault of putting that power button at the top. It allows to not only turn on the screen with the double tap, but you can also launch straight into apps. I really use it for the camera and phone, but there are plenty of other options. And it works really well.\nFinally, there\u2019s an auto-startup app in the power management that I have become fond of. It allows the user to decide which apps can start automatically and run in the background. Apps like my mobile banking and Instagram have no business using my battery and RAM all the time (IMHO, of course), and I like having the power to control what\u2019s happening.Other Thoughts:\nI used the OnePlus One for a while. I\u2019d say that\u2019s this phone\u2019s biggest competition. The camera and screen are definitely better on the One, but it was a software nightmare. I had more issues with the software on that phone than any phone I\u2019ve used. Now that they are the same price, would I pick one over the other? I\u2019m glad I\u2019m using the Asus for the added ram and smoother experience, but I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d be upset either way. Both are nice phones and heavily featured for the price. I\u2019m hoping this becomes a trend.\nDid I ever mention this phone was fast? Fast processing that isn\u2019t held up by a lack of RAM and fast charging. Think annoying Jimmy John\u2019s commercial fast.\nI got the flip cover as part of my introduction package. I tried it and I still don\u2019t like flip covers, though the window was pretty useful. If you like flip covers, the Zenfone does it well.\nSome aren't impressed by the design of the phone. It's clean and simple. There's not much to complain about here. I'm glad they did as little as they did instead of trying to make it a spectacle. It will look good in a year. Something wild may have gotten old.

[{"title": "Zenfone 2 Review", "thread": [{"postID": "post4497154", "text": "I'd like to thank both Android Central and ASUS for hooking me up with a Zenfone 2. It's been an interesting few weeks and I'd like to discuss the device briefly for anyone who was thinking of picking it up.Physical Appearance\nIt's big. I'm coming from an HTC One m7 so the size difference took a few days to get used to. This is also my first phone with the volume buttons on the back. While I think that the back buttons are a cool novelty, I personally prefer my phones to have them on the side. The power button on top is as terrible as most of the other reviews have said but the phone has double tap to wake so it's not a problem. The actual design of the device is incredibly nice. I think ASUS hit the nail on the head as it pertains to the shape and feel of the phone. The device I won in this contest came with the flip case which is AMAZING. It's grippy and the circular window is fun to glance at your information through. If anyone is interested in this phone I would say pick up the case. It adds a ton of functionality.Hardware\n4gb of RAM, 64gb of ROM. This thing plays and runs everything that I throw at it. Multitasking is phenomenal and there isn't a stutter or a lag to be found! I think that Android needs 3gb+ to really shine and this proves it. Software\nI'm in love with ZEN UI. This is not an understatement. Coming from a Google Play Edition m7, I thought that I would hate a non-stock-ish experience but I was dead wrong. ZEN UI is fun and fast and it needs to be seen to be believed. Using the ZF2 is pushing me in the direction of buying one of ASUS's tablets. They need to keep up their frequent updates and they will sway people in their direction in no time.Camera\nIt won't replace your point and shoot or DSLR but it's a sharp and crisp camera that is sufficient enough for Instagram or Facebook. The addition of built in collage functionality and filters will be a great thing for those social media savvy people who feel the need to edit their photos before posting.Battery\nI get about 4-5 hours of screen on time using LTE and 5-6 hours of screen on time using WiFi. I don't ever measure standby time because when I'm not using my phone...I'm not using it. The QuickCharge feature is now something I can never live without. I get from 0-60 in about 30-40 minutes. That's great. I can't believe how well that works.Sound\nThis phone has a perfectly acceptable speaker. It didn't blow me away like the HTC One line of phones did but I don't mind it. I think if they add front firing speakers to next years model I would go out and buy it in an instant.GRADE\n8/10FINAL THOUGHTS\nIf I didn't win the device, I was planning on picking it up to try it out anyway. I've never owned an ASUS phone before but the pricing on this device was what had sold it for me. Do I think the model I won is worth the $300 that they are charging for it? Yes. I think that if in a few months they have a temporary sale where they charge $250, they will have an even harder time keeping it in stock. HARD TIMES! (Dusty). \nNext year... front firing speakers and if you insist on keeping the volume buttons on the back, add the power button there too! That's all it would take to bring the grade up to a 9ish/10.", "time": "06-15-2015 09:12 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4497303", "text": "Overall, I am inclined to agree about a good phone for the price point.", "time": "06-15-2015 10:37 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4497468", "text": "Hey guys, u think that the phone is pretty big and isn't easy to hold.

Hardware: not much to gripe about here ran everything i threw at it and then some the 4gb of ram really shines in multitasking let no one fool you aside from things like fingerprint scanners and heart rate monitors you not missing much from the likes of the m9 or the s6. this phone punches above its price point. Software: zen UI is not the best but i feel it is better than most skins on the market the main gripe is the amount of bloatware that it comes with but this is subjective because not everyone will think of the apps as bloat. the ui is snappy no lag what so ever and i like the fact that their are lots of quick toggle options. zen ui is great on top of android 5.0 but i wished they started with 5.0.2 or later. Sound: not much to speak of here the sound is ok its not boom sound by a long shot but it will pass Camera: i will say that I'm not great with camera but the zenfone 2's camera gets the job done it wont wow you like the likes of the g4 and the s6 but i've have seen some great shots on the forums the average user wont have to try hard to get some great shots. Battery: its not the best i've seen but i can get though the day with the zenfone 2's battery i hope with an update to 5.0.2 or 5.1 we will see an improved battery life Overall: i give this phone an 8.5/10 i do not feel like this is a budget phone or a mid tier phone it is up there with the likes of the s6/m9 and the i6 but the zenfone 2 is not a perfect phone but it does turn heads and make people wonder why their phones cost 600-900 dollars i can't wait for more from asus", "time": "06-15-2015 10:32 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4496609", "text": "All good points.

I tried to like it. I really did. Its zippy, its nigh unstoppable, not a stutter. But it is so bloated with unnecessary things that you can't uninstall, yes you can disable them. But thats not the point. Generously speaking, id say theres about 12 bloat apps. Very generously. For example, theres an app called mirror. Mirror is just the front facing camera. What.\nOne more thing, the notifications pull down is quite ugly. Thats all. Its just plain ugly.\nTop middle power button. No. 5.5 inch phone? did this not seem like a bad idea? Regardless, knock to wake works so well that Its hard to complain about this.\nSpeaker: this is the last thing. The speaker looks large on the outside, but only about 1/4th of it is actually pushing out sound. Its actually covered up in the interior of the backplate.\nPROS:\nPerformance:\nI don't know what else to say other than spectacular. Blows my brothers One M8 out of the water. I've played riptide GP whilst having need for speed open in the background and neither of them stuttered at all. You can do anything with this monster of a phone. Ive not been able to slow it down so far.Price I wont say much about. This is the absolute best bang for the buck you can get. Period.\nBATTERY LIFE:\nI plug in every night at about 40%, with mixed use i can go two days.\nMy day starts at 9am and ends at 11pm.\nI had no experience with quick charge before, and this absolutely blew my mind. 60% in a little over a half hour. The phone gets pretty hot in that half hour  but totally worth it. Plug it in 10 minutes during the day if you're running low and youre good to go for a couple more hours. Its fantastic.\nCAMERA:\nI'll let the pictures speak for themselves.\nThis is the M8.\nThis is the Zenfone2\nFinal notes: One thing I didnt mention as a con or pro is the screen. The screen is good. But it is not bright. Not by a long shot.\nBottom Line: \nIts only a matter of time until Asus starts scaring the big boys. \nIf you're on budget, buy this Fone.

Not a big deal but it's fast. A lot faster than the old touch and hold and wait for it to buzz and open. Plus themes are cool and plentiful for phone.\nAlso, I'm crazy about the Zen cover app. I got a cheap case with the cutout circle hole just for using this feature and I may never go back to another case. I think this app nails what all of the lock screen widgets in custom roms were trying to do but we're always too bulky and buggy for me. The main screen has a notification for all new phone calls, texts and emails. All you have to do is long press and it jumps to a nice read only screen that is very easy to read you're emails or whatever. Like it. Also around the whole screen is a lit up circle that shows your battery percentage. Didn't notice that until I was fully charged and saw that it went all the way around.\nAlso if you move around the edge of circle you can get to any app quickly like camera or flashlight. Nice feature although i usually just swipe. Also you can answer phone from this screen or reject calls all without opening case. \nAlso, search for any app in app drawer.

Below are the steps that you can also follow to see how things work out for you:\n1) After using your phone, clear all the apps from the recent items(click the lower right button and remove all the running apps).\n2) CM(Clean master) app provided with the phone is great, use it as wisely and your phone will perform much better.\nUse CM to regularly clean your junk files as well as use the one tap boost option every time after using your phone and before locking it.\n3) Use the Auto start manager to check which apps starts when you start your phone, keep it to minimal, i only kept social networking apps like (Facebook, Watsapp etc.) in auto start option, it will help a lot.\n4) Go to Setting -->App and disable the ones that you don't need like I disabled apps from google like google drive, google music etc.\n5) Disable WIFI or 3G data when you don't need it, disabling it for limited time when you don't need it will save a lot your battery's juice.\n6) Also disable location(GPS) when you don't need it.\nThat's it guys, i followed the above steps and my phone had normal usage in 48 hr window like i played games for like 6 hrs,listened to music for 4 hrs, used net for 8 hrs and was on call for 2 hrs.

It looks expensive and like a flagship device. But over time, you can see where there were compromises. The size is comfortable. I currently use an iPhone 6 Plus, and the ZenFone is more comfortable to hold in the hand. Although, I like the way the curved back feels when holding the device in my hand, I don't like it when it sits on my desk at work. The volume buttons on the back and power button on the top were awkward at first. But I have really gotten used to the having the volume buttons on the back. And I have gotten used to the double tap to unlock and put the phone in sleep mode. Capacitive buttons are ok, but not being illuminated just seems to be a sacrifice Asus shouldn't have made. The back plate is difficult to pry off. And the slot to put your fingernail in to get it open is edged with cheaper plastic so you can cause scratches or indentations when trying to get the back off. \nZen UI\nAt first, I wasn't sold on the UI, but after using the device non-stop for the weekend and a day at work, I have come to really appreciate it. I like the extra features like tap to wake and sleep, kid mode, being able to easily add icon packs and themes, and pinning pages. It is a light skin so the device flies when navigating. It retains a lot of the material design. The keyboard is easily my favorite. It is very responsive and accurate. And I like the options to adjust the height and change the color of it. \nPerformance\nAgain, the device flies. I pinned it against my Note 4 and iPhone 6 Plus and it is faster than both in most tasks. The only area that it was not the clear winner is when starting games. The iPhone 6 Plus was faster initiating games. There aren't any stutters or hiccups with this device. Battery life was middle of the road. About 4 hours of on screen time. Screen is good. I have read about issues with the brightness, but I haven't found it to be any more of a problem than with my other devices. When it comes to gaming, the ZenFone 2 is really good. There are some graphically intense games that lose frame rates while playing, but I'm not sure if this is an issue with the ZenFone 2 or the games. Playing Real Racing 3, Modern Combat 5, and GT Racing 2, I have seen some stutters. But I saw them as well and even more with the Note 4. So compared to other Android devices, it is probably the top performer that I have experienced. But, compared to the iPhone 6 Plus, it falls short in this area. Call quality seemed really good. The call volume was a little low, but it was very clear. Bluetooth connectivity was also very good. Didn't have any issues pairing it with Ford SYNC. WiFi connectivity also seems adequate. I didn't have any issues. \nCamera\nThe camera was decent. Nothing really to write home about or complain about either. Going through the settings, it seemed to be the usual features. Nothing really stood out to me. I didn't notice that there isn't a 60 FPS video recording mode. This was a little disappointing. Of course there isn't 4K video recording either. Pics taken in normal conditions were good. The shutter speed was a little slow, so was the focusing. I took a bunch of blurry photos before I realized that the camera wasn't focused just yet. Sometimes it will lock in like it is focused, but it really isn't. But in the end I was able to take decent to very good photos. I don't really take pictures in low light. But it wasn't a bad experience. \nValue\nThis is where this device becomes intriguing. I like to weigh the value of my tech. Sometimes cheaper isn't better. Sometimes I need to pay top dollar for a great experience. This is where I am very interested in this device. I had previously owned a Moto G and it was worth the price, but not worth the sacrifices I was making to have it. The ZenFone 2 does lack some hardware features like heart rate monitor, fingerprint scanner, IR blaster, and optical image stabilization. But, it hasn't really affected my experience with the device. And considering that for the price of my AT&T Note 4 I can get the ZenFone 2 and a nice Chromebook with money to spare. Or, for the price of my 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus, I could get the ZenFone 2, Chromebook, a cheaper tablet, with money to spare. Also considering that you get 100 GB of Drive storage to boot, makes owning this device definitely worth the price and then some. \nBottom line\nAnyone purchasing this smartphone for any reason whether it be price or performance, won't be disappointed. I have really enjoyed the device and the value is hard to beat. \nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk", "time": "06-01-2015 12:22 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4464664", "text": "Nice review.\nPosted via the zenfone 2", "time": "06-02-2015 03:05 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4467367", "text": "I'm really starting to dig the size of this phone.", "time": "06-03-2015 07:07 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4467449", "text": "Weird thing is, using this device makes me want a Nexus 5.", "time": "06-03-2015 08:03 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4468521", "text": "I wonder if they're planning M for us on the Zenfone 2?", "time": "06-03-2015 03:22 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4468523", "text": "Thats a good question. \nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk", "time": "06-03-2015 03:23 PM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"postID": "post4469503", "text": "I'm currently flip flopping between an S6 and Nexus 6.

Only a limited number of companies manufacture UMA-enabled phones and they only add the feature to their higher end phones due to the cost. HTC's ONE Models and Samsung S6 are examples of UMA-enabled phones. Even if your UMA-enabled phone wasn't a T-Mobile issued phone the wifi-calling still works because the UMA-enabling module is standardized so it's the same for all manufactures. \nThe carriers that provide wifi-calling networks like T-Mobile (which I love and have used for 7+ years) told me that on some non-TMobile phones you many need to update your Access Point Name (APN) parameters but that is a very easy process that they will help you with or you can quickly do on your own. The parameters are not for the wifi-calling but are to optimize you non-TMobile phone for use on TMobile's network. I've been reading that some new smartphones are smarter than others and will automatically update your APN parameters when you switch to a different carrier. With these phones you just roam into the new network and your phone immediately updates your APN parameters and you're ready to go. Very cool! \nI highly recommend you read about Generic Access Networks under Wikipedia. There is all the info you're looking for except a list of all current 2015 UMA-enabled phones.

I'm coming from an HTC One M8 and compared to that, this thing is a beast. It runs circles around the M8. It even bests my Galaxy Tab S 10.5 in some games. It's really that fast and they weren't kidding about multitasking working very well. \nHardware-wise, build quality is solid but I'm not a big fan of the feel of the plastic back (got the silver). The Nexus 5 plastic is much nicer. I'm hoping those Illusion back covers are nicer quality. \nIt fits well in my hand, but my index finger never falls right in the middle of the phone. So those volume buttons are just a huge hassle to get to and that power button is too flush to press easily. And while some people might not like the fixed capacitive nav keys, I'm a fan. Software keys take up screen space and require extra swipes when they're hidden. Plus Google has implemented them to always show up on the right side which irks me as a lefty.\nCompared to the M8, the Zenfone 2 doesn't get anywhere near as hot either. Played some games while charging and the M8 would get too hot to hold. The ZF2 was not much more than warm.\nThe screen quality is decent. Next to a flagship, it's obviously worse but it's perfectly acceptable for a $300 phone.\nSoftware-wise, I'm actually pretty impressed with Asus here. Yes there's bloat, quite a lot of it actually, but some of it is perception also, Asus has lots of tiny apps that many other manufacturers would hide as settings. There's an app called Splendid that handles the vivid screen settings for example. And in the Asus apps, if there's any new menu items after a software update, Asus helpfully puts a little 'N' icon to indicate it's new. \nSome misc notes:\nSound quality of the speaker is bad, as expected. But at least with headphones on, you get a full equalizer instead of HTCs Beats On/Off control. \nI've successfully used a USB thumb drive and it shows up ok in the File Manager so that's supported unlike in Nexus devices. \nI ran into some weird screen tearing while slowly scrolling pages up and down but can't seem to replicate it now.\nThe rewards tab in the Starbucks app crashes consistently. I wonder if that's an issue with the Intel proc.

This phone is huge next to the Moto G and will most likely have to be used with 2 hands for most tasks. The power button is at the top of the device, but luckily you can double tap the phone to wake and turn off the screen (you double tap on a blank spot of the notification bar to turn the phone off). The screen looks great to me and is definitely a step up from the moto g.\nI find the volume on the phone to be very quiet. I use bluetooth in my morning commute with the app Pocketcasts and it definitely outputs sound at a quieter level than the moto g. I also haven't found a way to silent the phone with no vibration. The menus in the phone are a little different than stock android, so learning the phone is taking me some time.\nThe phone also seems to be using much more power than the moto g so far. Much of this is due to me playing with a new phone, but even on stand by it seems to be using 7-10% of the power per hour. The phone is running a version of 5.0 Lollipop, so im not sure if it is the operating system or the radios causing the big power drain. Even with my phone plugged in with only Waze, Pocketcasts, and Agent running the battery was still draining and actually lost power during my commute. The Moto G wouldn't loose any power under a similar use. Hopefully the battery will get a little better as the days go on and the phone settles in.\nThe camera and storage are miles above the moto g. It is really nice to not have to worry about memory. The phone has 64 gbs of memory and will even let you download apps to the sd card. The phone is also very fluid and switching apps is great. It definitely doesn't chug along like the moto g did. The camera probably isn't as nice as the flagships, but is great for just posting to social networks. I could even take photos inside the house that are usable, which I couldn't really do with the moto g.\nLet me know if you have any questions.

I'm not one of the official reviewers for AC, but here are my thoughts so far:\nErgonomics - Pretty good for a 5.5 inch phone. certainly easier to handle than my Galaxy Note 4 that I used to have, and the ASUS does have the nifty one-hand mode that shrinks the screen and moves it to the side, which is handy. I like the volume on the back as well. Power button is hard to press and hard to use on the top, but tap to wake/sleep works well so no biggie.\nPerformance - Flawless, in practice. Really fast. No stutters, pauses, crashes, redraws. Just gets it done, multitasking, games, whatever. zero complaints at all here. Screen has good brightness and resolution, sound quality is very good from headphones, adequate from speaker. No issues at all with heat, signal reception, voice quality, etc.\nUI - I really REALLY like ZenUI, and a lot of the apps/features that come with it. Reminds me of HTC Sense in that there are a lot of logical improvements to Android, without feeling like unnecessary bloatware. Things like What's Next, Save for Later, and PC Link are genuine value adds.\nCamera - been lots of discussion here. I've done a lot of testing, and here's the real deal. the camera defaults are terrible...the image optimization is a horrid mess that turns good pictures into impressionist paintings, and for some reason the default is also \"standard\" image quality, rather than \"fine\". I have no idea why that's even a choice, but there you go. Once you turn off image optimization, and change quality to Fine, the camera is really good. It does not have OIS, which is to be expected at this price point, but the dynamic range is adequate and the color balance is very good. With the image optimization completely off, resolved detail is extremely high, which is a good thing...but you will also see a bit more \"noise\", or grain, than you're used to seeing from other cameras that apply just a little noise reduction. The ASUS camera does give you the option to do that, I just have decided I'd rather go with a bit of noise and better resolved detail.\nVideo is quite another story. While the camera does do 1080p video, the quality is middling at best. Without OIS, there is quite a bit of shaking, and the image stabilization is mediocre. Also, the image stabilization only works for 720p video.\nBattery - the battery situation is basically ok. Standby is fine...I lose less than 2% battery per hour during standby, and that's with an exchange account, an outlook account, and three Gmail accounts syncing at all times, along with high accuracy location and google now enabled. Screen-on battery is a bit higher than ideal...in regular use, expect about 4 hours, not much more. However, since the quick charger is...quick, I haven't found this to be a big problem.\nMy only frustration at the moment is that the phone is still on 5.0, rather than 5.0.2. That means smartlock is still busted for certain exchange accounts (like mine) that mandate at PIN code. This is a Google problem, not an ASUS problem.\nHope that helps...", "time": "04-17-2015 01:29 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4367263", "text": "Flawless review, you definitely expressed everything in a fair, organized and logical manner.\nSent from the Ace's Tapatalk 4", "time": "04-17-2015 02:13 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4368104", "text": "Thanks again, Quantify.

I don't know if many are interested in my model but I will do the review anyways. I got the ZE550ML off of ebay. This is the model with the lower 1.8 processor, 2GB of RAM 16GB storage. There is also no NFC. So this is definitely the lowest end model of the 5.5\". For me though I decided to trade the high end for hopefully what would be more battery life. 720p screen on a 5.5\" phone is more than acceptable for me. Before this I have had a nexus 4 and then most recently a Nexus 5. I really liked the 4 but I would consider myself a pretty heavy user so the Nexus 5 didn't work for me since I would be charging the thing in early afternoon, so it wouldn't even give me close to a day. I also needed a dual sim phone so this fit perfectly.\nI will try not to repeat what quantify said (sorry if I do) in his review because he did a great review and covered a lot. I would imagine that the 4gb version is faster but I have had no problems at all with this version. It's very quick and responds well. I have had a few apps close out but I believe that is on the developers end and not an Asus problem. \nAsus's Zenui was tough to get used to but the more I saw and got used to the features the more I have enjoyed using it. The settings that are available are great and they greatly improve the android experience.\nThe build quality of this phone is really impressive. In no way does it feel like a mid end device. I thought it was very heavy compared to my nexus 5 but now I don't even notice it and don't mind the heaviness at all. One of my friends couldn't believe it wasn't a high end device. As you can see in the picture I got the white version, which I thought they were going to make it look like the etched metal plastic version but they didn't and instead it has a nice feeling matte material. The only problem with this is that it is very slippery! I am being very careful and can't wait till my case arrives. The volume buttons are great where the are and as everyone else has said the power button is in a stupid position, but double tap to wake is good and you get used to its position after awhile and don't think about it.\nI couldn't be happier with the implementation of the dual sims and love not carrying around two phones with me.\nSo now for Battery. Now I don't really know what is considered great because my nexus 5 was in between 3-4h of SOT, which I think is aweful. So this phone has been very good. It has consistently gotten better with each charge and since I am still only a week into using it I think it will still get better. I am only on 3g since I need to upgrade my sim card but I will post again when I get LTE on it to see if it's any different. I had to charge the phone this mourning so this is the last screen shot I could take, but I think I could easily get to 7 hours of SOT in the future.\nThat's about it.

Put an offer for a red 4GB model on eBay last night and it was accepted. Not sure if it's something I'll keep, but worth giving it a shot since I'm a little bored with my Note 4 after 7 months. I'll update with impressions when I receive it!\n***EDIT 05/11***\nReceived my Red 4GB (RAM), 32GB, Zenfone 2 earlier today. To preface, I purchased this on a whim, since I already have a fine device in the Note 4. So my expectations were fairly low considering the overall cost of this device ($340 with shipping; received in 3 business days). Also for a little more info about me -- I have a tendency to jump around phones quite often. I owned a number of flagships last year (LG G3, Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Moto X, OnePlus One and more), so I have a good feel for most user experiences that are offered from the major OEM's.\nAfter immediately unboxing and booting it up, I was blown away. This truly feels like a device that is $500+. Yes, it's plastic, but has a wonderfully solid build that truly feels great in the hand. The texture on the rear is great, the curvature of the phone makes it sit in the hands perfectly, and the red finish is stunning. There is no creaking or flex from any part of the phone. This is what I wanted the G3 of last year to feel like.\nAnyways, onto the screen. Again, pleasantly surprised. It's extremely sharp, as to be expected from a 1080p screen, and the color reproduction is fantastic. The ability to change the temperature is a bonus as well. Brightness is average, but it fairs very well in sunlight. Not as good as my Note 4, but I don't feel like I'm missing anything drastic when comparing both screens. Touch input and responsiveness is just as good as any modern phone as well.\nZen UI... Is phenomenal. I've only been playing with it for a few hours now, but it is easily my favorite 1st party launcher out there. It's crazy smooth, the animations are on point, and above all it actually looks good. There's a ton of customizations and nuances, so I feel absolutely no need to switch to Nova Prime or something. You can change themes, icon packs, scroll effects, fonts... Pretty much everything you'd want to do, you can. The system apps look and function very well. I feel like this is what TouchWiz should be.\nHowever, there is quite a bit of bloat here. You can uninstall about a third of it or so, which is good. And you have the ability to disable and hide whatever other apps you don't like/need.\nHaven't spent too much time with the camera, but the interface is adequate. It's speedy, takes pictures fast, and produces good results. I'll need more time to fully judge it, but it's not on the same level as the Note 4. Again though, it's good enough for me, and I don't feel like I'll need to jump back to my Note 4 in order to get some decent shots of my car or a sunset. Any shortcomings I find, I believe I'll be able to adjust accordingly with Snapseed.\nI love that Intel supports fast charge, and it works as advertised. Battery fills up every bit as fast (if not faster) than my Note 4. Went from 45% battery to 100% in about 35-40 minutes. I can't judge battery life yet, obviously. \nAll in all, this is worth every single penny thus far.

As far as the rest of the phone, the specs are generally good and I would expect you would have no problem using this phone for some time. \nHowever, there will certainly be innovations and changes within the next 3 years so you may find yourself wanting some of the new features that will inevitably come out. This is true of any phone you could get at any time. There is also the issue of software updates. Most phones are not supported for 3 years. I don't personally know how long Asus usually supports phones with upgrades. Typically manufacturers support phones for 18-24 months from release. So if you have the phone for 3 years, you may not be able to upgrade after that unless you root and load a different ROM, which may or may not still be being developed either that long after release.\nIf you get the 551ML model with 4GB RAM that's ahead of the curve right now so others will have to catch up at the moment. And choose the faster processor since there are two options and the 64GB storage size. \nNow I'm not sure if the 64GB SD card max is a definitive permanent limit or not. I'm not sure why it doesn't support 128GB but we'll see soon if it recognizes one (my 128GB card got damaged so I only have 64 and 32 sizes now, but someone else on here said they are going to try their 128 card). It's possible you may need more storage space in the future as app sizes are getting larger and larger and it depends on what you store on your phone - like video or large files. But many people never even use 32 GB so it depends on your own personal usage whether this even matters to you. You can get 64GB internal storage plus 64GB SD card and have 128GB total - minus system size. For the average person that's plenty, but for some that may not be future-proof.\nThere's also the battery to consider. Battery life will certainly decline over that period of time, so it matters how dependent you are on long battery life on a normal basis. If you need it to last all day off charger day after day and expect you will still have this need 2-3 years from now, you may towards the end of that period be getting far shorter battery life than you started with. \nThree years is pushing it with any phone as far as being up to date with current tech - hardware and software. If you're leaning more towards the two year side, I wouldn't be worried unless you're the type of person who is going to miss not having the latest and greatest.", "time": "04-04-2015 05:17 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4330844", "text": "As great as this phone is right now, the battery drain is killing me, and this will probably be my last day with it.

We both have and love the HTC Desire EYE. So, let me tell you a bit about the zf2 in that context. \nPhysically, the zf2 is only slightly larger than the EYE, but it's much heavier and doesn't feel quite as premium. They both share an oddly mushy yet hard to press power button. I have come to appreciate the rear mounted volume controls, however. The tap to wake and Zen motion gestures to launch applications are also really cool, but I've had to disable them because they occasionally launched while in my pocket. \nThe software reminds me very much of sense in both function and logic. One of the brilliant things about sense is that it includes really useful upgrades to the stock android experience. ZenUI is like that, but even better, frankly. Sense does a great job with power management, showing which apps drained the battery over specific time periods. ZenUI goes much farther in both reporting and function, allowing the user to disable background usage and wake locks app by app, for example. I really find the entire ZenUI experience very polished and useful, and switching back to the EYE or my z3 compact seems like a downgrade. \nPerformance on the zf2 is just beastly. While the EYE is certainly great and never left me wanting, the zf2 can multitask completely effortlessly, with no stuttering, pauses, redraws, or whatnot. Scrolling in chrome is perfectly smooth always. The camera launches immediately. Swiping on the keyboard never lags or decides to occasionally miss a trace. \nOne of the reasons I love the EYE is for the rear camera. The selfie camera was never a draw for me... but the imx214 sensor, coupled with a two tone flash and fantastic camera software, is a great combination. The zf2 is actually better. Low light we know about. The real power of the zf2 camera is in software that is more powerful yet easier to use, combined with even better image processing. The first thing you have to do though is TURN OFF THE DAMN IMAGE OPTIMIZATION in camera settings. The stock settings make every picture look like an impressionist painting. Yecch. You may want to do manual optimization mode, and turn up saturation a smidge, but that's your call. \nOnce that's done, you'll find the pictures to be excellent. Good colour, dynamic range, and well controlled noise. ZenUI expands on the excellent EYE experience in a few ways. The first is with useful image stabilization. This is followed with a neato ability to long press in the viewfinder and lock focus and exposure. Finally, the software is smart enough to recognize when HDR works be useful, and unobtrusively provide a direct link on the viewfinder. The HDR works very well, and the overlay shows few haloes and no loss of detail. \nBattery. Not great, probably not as good as the EYE, but I'm finding perfectly livable. The quick charge capability helps. No worse than my wife's Moto X 2nd gen. \nHope that helps.
