I got the chinese model where it has better specs which comes in 6gb of ram with 128gb of storage. If you are planning to get this phone you might as well pick up the 128gb of storage with the 6gbs of ram. Due people using this phone more as a tablet i think having the bigger storage and more ram will help you run this phone a lot smoother. Overall been using this phone for a few days. Its not amazing but its truly unique. does turn a lot of heads. Overall the phone was built for the Chinese market. So anyone who is living in china or hongkong or taiwan will probably love this phone. the game pad and stuff will work amazing with the local big moba games like &#29579;&#32773;&#33635;&#32768;\u00ad. Probably wont run as smooth and wont be able to utilized the game pad on the dual screen when playing game from the overseas google playstore. Camera is alright not amazing but i would prefer them having two cameras one on each screen then just having one on the main. It gets really annoying when using it to scan QR code or when you are taking any pictures. It does take some getting use to. Another issue i had with the phone is probably the finger print sensor. Its definitely not in a good spot and pretty hard to use. they should have just made the finger print sensor on the bottom of the main screen when they have so much bezel space. Other then that the phone is decently made not really Ergonomically friendly but you will get use to it slowly. I see people using this more as a secondary phone or a tablet  that would be easy to carry out that doesn't take up a lot of space.

What we are missing is a universal grammar to describe those forms.  Then it would be possible to: \r\n(1) Iteratively list all possible configurations \r\n(2) Evaluate each according to formal criteria, and score appropriately (depending on which criteria you prefer). \r\nIf we had this formal grammar, I wouldn't need to make the following point, as it would follow naturally from the evaluation of the design options. \r\nIn this particular case, this type of screen-size-doubling concept is just what I'd like, EXCEPT that I want it to close with the screens on the INSIDE, so they are protected, and so that closure defines a \"screen/power off\".  That means that your screen(s) are physically protected, and that your software is also protected from randomly triggering in your pocket.   \r\nThese were some of the key attractions of the old flip-phones, which some people love so much.  Its a very reassuring feeling to close a flip phone and know that you can't scratch your screen and that you have definitely finished the call and finished using the software (till you open it again). \r\nHaving the screens close on the outside, as in the Axon M, means you can use tent mode to play to someone sat opposite you - which is something I'll use if I ever have a 90 year old friend (that doesn't own a smartphone) who has the same taste in movies sat opposite me. In other words, not very often. \r\nScreens on the outside also means that you only need one camera (and a few other things ... but a 2nd camera is small and cheap, so that should not dictate a fundamental design decision. \r\nWe need to all get away, somehow, from these design issues becoming a kind of personal vendetta, and instead see each device as reflecting the optimum of a preferred set of criteria.
