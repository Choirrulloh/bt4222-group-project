I like getting a new phone every two years, and when I upgrade, it has to be a real upgrade! I was coming from a HTC One Max, so the new phone had to have the following:\n\n1. Same sized screen, or very close. When you get a 50 inch TV, you do not want to go back to a 20!  \n2. The internal storage had to be more. I went from 32 to 64GB. \n3. My phones HAVE to have an SD card slot for storage expansion. I use Google Drive, but access to it is too slow, and it uses data transferring or adding files to it if I am off wifi.\n4. The V10 has a replaceable battery, which was the only thing I did not like about the One Max.
