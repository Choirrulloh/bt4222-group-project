Otherwise, it will be utterly boring. \r\nAnyway, as to your allegations LG could sabotage the Oreo update, yes it's very real. LG is copying Samsung's book, making phones obsolete faster with sealed batteries and putting more colorful but shortlived, fragile curved screen amoled/poled displays. In fact, the V30 is like the new Samsung flagships in terms of planned hardware  obsolescence. I mean I've seen far too many newer Samsung phones as recent as your S7 that are already suffering from pink bars, shifted white balance, dimmed display,  severe burn ins and screen cracks originating at the curved edges (weakest spot) this early in their life cycle. In contrast, I have as yet to see any sign of ips display deterioration or wear on my still perfectly bright, still perfectly color balanced (no hue shifts), in my more than 5 year old Lenovo P770 smartphone. Of course I only use it now as a dual sim call and text phone, flashlight, mp3 and movie player (it has dedicated sd card support)  and FM radio (which I like because it's the only phone I have/had which can broadcast FM radio via loudspeaker without needing to attach a headphone to its jack). Besides, it still is very reliable and as fast as it was when it was new (by 2012 standards) with its never been updated jellybean android software. It's not waterproof but never had an accidental water contact in more than 5 years. Drops? Well it had plenty but the casing and its plastic body and back cover protected it. Part of its reliability is the long battery life, although I have already replaced the original 3500mAh battery with a new one. (The original worn out battery lost capacity and then shortly became swollen/bloated after 4 years of use  and was no longer charging). 3500mAh removable battery in a small 4.5\" ips display was possible back then in 2012, without making the phone too thick so its really sad we have much bigger and more expensive flagship phones with much less  battery capacity and a sealed one at that. That's hardware planned obsolescence.  \r\nNow my concern really is in so addition to hardware, software upgrades can be an area which manufacturers can also incorporate planned obsolescence. Strictly speaking, there's high possibility with smartphone sales slowing down due to a saturated market, manufacturers will intentionally slow down phones with software updates. It's a common complaint from Samsung and iphone owners so who knows if LG and other manufacturers follow the leaders. There should be strict regulation like in France which strongly prohibits intentionally making product changes that adversely impacts a product's useful life (making it shorter to encourage frequent purchases).  \r\n---\n ", "date": "04 Feb 2018"}, {"text": "Lol.

I'd upgrade in a heartbeat if I were you while the V20 is available and priced at superb discount prices.  More than the removable battery, the V20 has a learning remote.  It works with even less known appliance brands, including most air-conditioners where ir blasters without learning mode will not be able to control. In addition, the V20 has support for 700mhz LTE band which, if your network supports it,  will give you better signal indoors making you enjoy high speed 4G+ internet even in basement parking spaces and elevators. Also, the V20 has 4K usb c to hdmi slimport support. If you like watching movies on your large screen tv from your phone, you will notice video quality and playback smoothness using wired slimport connection is absolutely so much better than wireless streaming. As a bonus, no need to waste data connection when you have the movie stored offline in your phone.  Also, the V20 supports HD playback of rented or purchased Google play movies. Most other Chinese brand phones like Lenovo, Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and even Oneplus flagship phones don't. I don't understand why Google play movies refuse HD download and playback in-phone with these phone brands.  Must be a studio licensing thing. So if you are into movie rentals and purchases and would like to play movies with DRM through your phone at the highest HD or even in 4k resolutions, the V20's support of HD and 4K playback via slimport adapter is heaven sent.  Other features the V20 has that the Vibe X3 doesn't have are dedicated SD card slot, which,  if you are like me who always use two sims and have 75GB worth of media files (stored in the dedicated sd card slot), the dedicated sd card support is just indispensable. Other improvements of the V20 over the Vibe X3 are the higher quality IPS screen with its higher QHD resolution and slightly bigger 5.7\" screen, faster processor and convenient reversible usb c with Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 (although you may not need to use it frequently due to the V20's removable battery). Speaking of removable battery, my Lenovo P770 is still alive up to now because of it. Unbelievable 2012 phone. My very first smartphone which had a huge 3500mAh battery at that time (2012) and removable battery too! After 4 years of daily use (I love its FM radio that doesn't need headphones to play out FM stations via loudspeaker), the battery became swollen/bloated.  Good thing third party battery replacements are very much available even until now, more than 5 years after the phone has been released so bought one for less than $10 and now, the phone is functional again. Amazing because it is now going towards its 6th year! The 3rd party removable battery saved it. Its IPS display is still perfectly color balanced, and very much still problem free as when it was new. The only major downside is its lack of storage space having only 4GB internal memory which is not enough for Google apps which cannot be moved to sd card at all. But even then, more than worth the investment. Of course, it still doesn't have fingerprint sensor, LTE support, ir blaster, wifi direct, slimport support, etc. being an old phone. It has never been upgraded by Lenovo from Jellybean but guess what? It's still as smooth and as fast (by 2012 standards) now  as it was when  brand new.

(but not in all aspects)\n \r\n1st of all the negatives are that there is no notification led light which I grown much accustomed to plus I miss the high brightness on a low setting of the note 4's amoled screen vs the dark ips LCD screen of V20. 50% brightness of V20 is like 20-25% of Note 4. And to be honest I turned off the V20's 2nd screen because it's actually pointless. Hence why I like the notification led and in reality this phone could easily have a 5.9 or exactly 6.0 inch screen and it would be the enough for anyone or the perfect maximum. \n \r\n2nd of all I chose this V20 because it has dual sims which I always wanted and the dedicated microsd slot is very rarely seen. Let me say that again, dedicated, so 3 slots in total. \n \r\n3rd is battery is removable just like in the note 4 but it's 3200mAh vs 3220mAh (marginal difference which really doesn't matter).\n \r\n4. IR blaster is very useful and both have it. \n \r\n5. FM Radio is also very convenient which note 4 doesn't have and I always wanted. \n \r\n6. The quad DAC's performance is something I have yet to test but I believe it's on par if not better than the Note 4's audio performance of which I can surely say was superb.\n \r\n7. The dual camera has proved itself to me that it blows the note 4 single cam and its dark aperture in the dust. \n \r\n8. I couldn't bare looking at phones with micro-USB ports anymore and the reversible USB-C in the V20 is a very big convenience and a hassle free cable plugging experience, plus the included flat charging/data cable is very nice & strong. \n \r\n9. Finally, the phone is slimmer in width vs note 4 yet its 1mm thinner as well therefore its nice to hold this phone in my hand and I hate the bezels on the note 4 and it's width but I  managed to use it with one hand anyway.\n \r\nOnly The Huawei mate 10 comes close to these two above and is the new kid on the block but the battery's sealed and non-removable if something ever goes wrong or if you just want piece of mind that your phone is truly 100% off with the battery pulled out. \n \r\nIn conclusion, get this phone. It's probably the last ever all in one best built phone ever made after the Note 4 and as a bonus it's military grade spec for shock with the 810G rating.  \r\nYou'll enjoy it.

And the v20's ips screen can suffer from LG's patented screen retention problem which actually gets worse with time.  If your screen is starting to show this problem then 18 months later the retention is going to get so bad and noticeable.  The only way to avoid it is use the phone lightly so it doesnt heat up (which means no camera and no games)\n \r\nAgain SD cards are not exclusive to the v20, a lot of phones take them and 2tb cards don't even exist yet and when they do you'll not be buying one because if you can afford a 2tb sd card then you could have afforded to buy a  better phone.  Remember the real reason why you bought the v20 in the first place, and that's because of the cheap price.\n \r\nFinally don't expect anymore updates for this phone so I hope you're comfortable with using Android 7.0 for the next 5 years.  Third party roms might come out but they'll have bugs and poor optimization and again, no support.\n \r\nCongratulations you have the 5.7 phone with the biggest bezels but now you're going to tell me that's a feature which makes it easier to hold.", "date": "23 Jan 2018"}, {"text": "It's not an opinion.

V20 battery can be charged externally using external charger if usb port is damaged/loosened and won't charge. Other flagships cannot have external charging of batteries (non removable). 4. V20 has dedicated sd slot. By using internal memory only for critical apps and storing voluminous media on sd card, there is less wear on internal storage, less full internal storage, causing less wear and longer life. Just replace sd card when damaged/slowed through repeated read/write or when always operating at full capacity. 5. V20 has dual sim slots, 2 dedicated ones. Other flagships have hybrid sim/sd slots.

The V30 is not that successor. I'll only compromise on features,  dropping some of them when my V20 is dead but no other phone with as complete a feature set is in sight. \n \r\nAgain, let me enumerate the features why I bought the V20 (update to Oreo has NEVER been one of them, but I do appreciate it if it gets Oreo or Peanut butter):\n \r\n1. The V20 has a built-in IR blaster to control all your appliances including those of your noisy neighbors. Volume of their sound system too high? Turn it down or turn it off with your V20 secretly through their window. It will scare the hell out of them so they will stop being noisy. Want to input your song number in a karaoke player? You can do it with your V20! Aircon? TV? Washing Machine? Car stereo? Teach your V20. It has a learn mode! Just REALLY spend time learning how to use it and customizing it and you'll wonder how you ever survived using a phone without one. \n \r\n2. The V20 has dedicated sd card slot, not that stupid hybrid slot where you are forced to choose between dual SIM or one SIM + SD card only.  With the V20, you can use the 2 SIM slots AND still add your SD card. What's more, the V20 supports up to 2TB micro sd cards.\n \r\n3. The V20 is probably the ONLY recent flagship with analog FM radio. All the rest have removed it. When theres a calamity, you'll  realize its utmost value when nothing other than your FM radio is working. When you just have to listen to your favorite DJ on those long trips without data available, you are going to realize how much you miss not having an FM radio with you, anytime, anywhere, without wasting data and draining your battery in the process. \n \r\n4. The V20 has drop resistance which ensures your phone will handle drops. More important than waterproofing really. I have dropped my phone a lot more times than wetting it with liquid and damaging it in the process. \n \r\n5. The V20 has slimport (hdmi out/4K video out) capability. Wireless screen share of movies is nice but results to downgrade in video quality due to WiDi bandwidth limitations. Not so with slimport. \n \r\n6. The V20 has removable battery. Low batt? Replace with a fully charged spare while charging the depleted battery using an external charger accessory. That means no charging time needed, no wear and tear of usb port (loosening), and no frequent exposure of phone internals from heat generated due to charging. Forget slow wireless charging! Why accelerate battery wear with even more heat? External charging is best! \n \r\n7. The V20 has high quality audio recording, high-quality 4K video capture with manual controls and superb photo capture with dual cameras and full manual controls. \n \r\n8. The V20 has a high resolution QHD IPS display with SECOND SCREEN. Place app shortcuts, your name or even  Christmas greetings or whatever you like (Halloween, Valentines, emojis, etc.) on the second screen. \n \r\n9. The V20 has fast charging when you need it through USB-C. It's  OTG compatible too! Usb thumb drives, external hard drives, even those in NTFS and exFAT formats (not limited to FAT32) can be read with the proper app. \n \r\n10. The V20 has analog headphone jack when all the rest have removed it. \n \r\n11. The V20 has LTE advanced (4G+) with support for wall penetrating 700mhz. It has ability to force network mode to 4G/4G+ only (LTE only) for those places where the auto mode (GSM/WCDMA/LTE auto) keeps on giving you the slower HSPA/HSPA+ (H/H+) signal. \n \r\n12. The V20's screen is a bright, 5.7\" IPS panel in ideal 16:9 aspect ratio. 18:9 may be IN nowadays but consider this: 18:9 screen actually makes Facebook photo feeds smaller! 18:9 is too narrow. It makes keyboard typing cramped for the same screen diagonal!  Reading in 18:9 curved phones look like reading text from a bottle of shampoo! Too much scroll! Amoled screens look nice, but if you didn't know already, they actually have much shorter life span than IPS panels. Amoleds tend to burn all their blue pixels and white pixels faster than the red and green ones, losing brightness faster  with time and skewing the white balance towards reddish or amber tones. \n \r\n13. The V20 has a powerful processor but costs only half to 1/3 the price of current flagships. Do you need the fastest processor for Facebook, Mobile Legends and Clash of Clans? No! Even the midrange snapdragon 625 will be do. Processors are like cars. The only benefit of the fastest cars are bragging rights and speeds in the race track. They're barely noticeable in everyday city driving. \n \r\nThe V20 is a phone meant to last and built to last, and not some latest trendy model that gets dumped after every year when newer flashy designs and newer models are released.\n \r\nGet the V20 if you truly want to slow down the nonsensical yearly upgrade cycle phone manufacturers push so hard on consumers with the main objective of making your phone obsolete faster than ever, but actually adding nothing meaningful other than a fresh new exterior design and a new color option. \n \r\nExterior designs and looks rapidly go out of style.

If you are not happy with me criticizing other phones,  then you should not stay here. Go to your phone's forum and express your satisfaction there (unless you are secretly wanting to buy a v20 or are working with sales and marketing to drive people away from the V20 and convince them to buy another brand or 'upgrade' to newer models). People like you go gaga over the fastest and latest processor, super duper looking amoled displays (that actually don't last as long as ips displays) and the latest trendy, curvy, elongated 18:9 new fashion phone of the year, that you forget the true essence of a smartphone - an all in one device that should be used for anything and everything if possible, as long as possible, to make life easy and to save money by not upgrading every year: gps/compass/maps, radio, master remote that controls everything that you can use anytime, anywhere and always with you, has dedicated sd slot for all your storage needs (no problems with storage devouring 4k videos, lossless music, large raw photo files, office files, etc.) has  removable battery for zero charging downtime, and costing only a third to half the cost of the newer models without those features. Now if those unique selling features have no use to you, then by all means, buy the latest disposable fashion oriented, flagship phone out there. Couldn't care less if all you do on your phone besides calling and texting is play games and post photos on Facebook. The V20 is not for you. Be happy because for your needs, you have a thousand other flagship choices. By the way, audio and video capabilities are not the ONLY thing that makes the V20 special. In fact, I didn't buy the V20 for those high level specs.  It's actually the more practical, mundane, daily use features that made me buy it. The audio, photo and video prowess were just icing on the cake . The removable battery, the ir blaster, the dedicated slot sd card, FM radio, etc. are actually very worthy features however insignificant they may be to you. It is the presence of ALL, I repeat, ALL of those features in a SINGLE flagship phone product that makes the V20 truly unique. Even the newer LG models don't have some of those features, more so Samsung which is just a tired fashion statement phone brand that is hot today, but will be passe' next year with a new model launching.  The V20 is not like that, mind you, because of the extensive  features list, analog or otherwise. The V20 is a phone built to last a long, long time. If you change phones every year it won't matter.

If the V20 came with a AMOLED screen then you'd be preaching that AMOLED is the best, right?

I can't blame you though for blacklisting LG as a brand due to your bootlooping experience, much in the same way I can't blame the Samsung owners, who will never buy a Samsung brand again; particularly the early adopters of the Note 7 who got to experience first hand, the smoking/exploding battery fiasco. Bottomline, what I'm saying may be ridiculous to you but personally, I have never stopped buying an entire brand of electronics due to bad experience with one of their product lines. I normally do not buy anymore from the seller or retailer who sold the defective product and would not replace my phone or extend any effort to help me with warranty issues. Actually  had bought two Lenovo phones in the past. The first seller gave me problems with my first  Lenovo phone as they always forwarded defective phones to a service center who took 2 to 3.months turnaround time. The next time the problem recurred, in my first Lenovo phone, I left my defective phone wirh them and vowed never to buy from them again. A few years later, another Lenovo phone captured my interest. Bought it from another retailer. A bit more expensive than the pricing from the previous seller but I bought it anyway. The new phone had battery problem 6 months later.  Went  to the new retailer from where I bought it and they just simply replaced my defective unit with a sealed,  brand new one. Mishandled the replacement unit by using an unauthorized sim adapter causing damage to the sim contacts and loss of network. Told the seller that replacement phone no longer had network signal. Guess what? they replaced again, for the second time, my unit with a brand new, sealed one because they said, their store policy is to replace defective units to avoid customer downtime, and they'll just take care forwarding and dealing with Lenovo customer service regarding the defective units. While I no longer have a Lenovo phone, I still do buy other brands drom this retailer. As you can see, the aftersales service varies from one retailer to another and drom one area, region or country to another. Even online sellers of phones vary. Had returned one camcorder once that I bought online. I was fully refunded including shipping, no questions asked. In another online seller where I bought a defective battery, I had to open a dispute and escalate it to a claim just to get mu money back. It's usually the  sellers of the product for me tha gets blacklisted; not the brand. But then again, it may be different in yiur case and in tiur country.

I perfectly understand ALL manufacturers at one point may put out a defective product, it's how they respond and handle it that makes the different.  LG's got a poor track record for it's customer service, just look at all the forums.\n \r\nYes, my G4 bootlooped.  Was I angry?  No.  Disappointed?  A little.  Anyways this is my experience:\n \r\n1. G4 bootloops 3 months after warranty expired.  I was able to get it to boot up long enough to get all my data off of it so I wasn't really upset, worse case I have a excuse to buy a new phone.  Anyways I take it to my local LG service center to see what they would do about it.  First things first, they said the warranty is finished so it's not covered.  Whatever, ok, how much to fix it?  They say $80 and it will be ready in about 2 weeks.  I think that's fine (I have a backup phone), pay, and leave it with them. \r\n2. 2 weeks later I get my G4 back.  Noticed they scratched the the top and side of the phone so I was a little angry because I keep my phones in pristine condition.  Anyways, I turned it on and the wifi wasn't working, the camera wasn't working, it wouldn't charge, and they reflashed a rom on it with broken resources so some of the widgets wouldn't work.  I was quite upset at this point as the whole phone was messed up.  I go back to the LG service center, show them the phone, and ask if I can just have my $80 back and I will go buy a new phone.  They say NO, they cannot do refunds but they can fix it.  Ha, ok, whatever, I leave the phone with them for another 2 weeks and tell them to please test everything before sending it back to me.  They say sure, no problem. \r\n3. 2 weeks later, my G4 comes back again.  Turned it on, still has the broken rom on it, wifi works, charging works, camera works.  Great.  First call I get, I can't hear anything because now the speaker is broken.  Great.  I go BACK to the LG Service Center the next for the 3rd trip quite upset showing them the problem.  Again, they say leave it with them (AGAIN) and they will fix it.  I once again to please tell them test everything before sending it back.  Again, they say sure, no problem. \r\n4. Another 2 weeks go by and I get my G4 back yet again.  Turned it on, same broken rom on it (they actually told me to download 3rd party widgets!  unbelievable) checked all the stuff that was broken form before and everything was working so I think finally great everything is working.  Wrong, a couple days later I found out the front facing camera was broken (I don't use it often) so I'm getting really fed up at this point.  The next day I go back to the LG service center for the 4th time (!!!) and show them the problem.  Guess what they say?  Yes, leave it with us for another 2 weeks again and we'll fix it.  Great, whatever, take it. \r\n5. 2 weeks later (this is almost 2 months after the first visit remember!) I get my G4 back.  I turned it on and immediately noticed it's got a new and fully functional rom and that the imei's have changed.  Yes, they FINALLY decided to swap the whole internals of the phone with new ones so now my G4 is like a brand new again and no problems.  \n \r\nSo as you can see, this is a customer service nightmare.  I PAID to have it fixed, had they fixed it right the first time I would probably still be a big LG fan today and quite possibly also be a v20 owner right now, too.  But they messed up big time and offered me NOTHING in exchange for all the inconvenience and multiple trips to their service center.  If I could do it all over again I wouldn't, I just would have gone out and bought a new phone right away and just chucked the G4 in the garbage.\n \r\nI may buy LG again in the future, but with my logic, since I had to go to their service center 3 times more than I should have, therefore, my next 3 electronics/appliances I buy for sure won't be LG.

My Samsung phones always slowed down and lagged like crazy after a while. The Note 7 was already lagging like crazy after just 2 weeks. The V20's wide angle camera is the most useful camera feature on the market the second screen allows for control of streaming services or on device music with the main screen off and gives notifications and access to settings, flashlight and certain apps with the screen off. The removable battery is just an awesome feature nothing like being able to just pop in a new charged battery and charge your other one in the battery charger.

The result was that my V20 screen looked better in all of the areas that Samsung applied their selective screen dimming.

I have to say, this phone is a pure BEAST! If raping replay buttons are overrated and an absurd understatement, I don't think that V20s raping other midrange and flagship smartphones would get the same response treatment. lmao. This phone is highly underrated indeed. If you're on a budget and still undecided on what smartphone to buy below the $400 price tag, no doubt, the LG V20 is the right one for you.\n \r\nPros: \r\n- Price (I got mine for $392 brand new) \r\n- Overall performance (The SD 820 x Adreno 530 x 4GB RAM combo is a safe bet that it would be future-proof) \r\n- Build quality (Although the top and bottom is made out of plastic, it can be easily scratched but the removable military-grade shockproof metal on its back is enough to secure your phone whenever accidental drops happen. Bad news for average to severe water-related accidents though. Fyi, I am not currently using any \"protective\" case for my V20 for I love to use it bare naked) \r\n- Rear Camera (Wide-angle feature. Flexible Manual mode. Great overall quality but sucks at low-light. Bro tip: Do not remove the removable plastic attached on the camera. It serves as an additional protection for unwanted cracks on the surface) \r\n- Audio and video recording (Outstanding. I highly recommend to set the video recording to manual whenever you feel the need to record videos) \r\n- HiFi Quad DAC (Bro tip: Get yourself a decent pair of headphones or earphones. I am still broke asf so I am currently stuck in using the bundled cheap version of B&O H3 earphones. Its sound quality is good, but a lackluster in some areas. However, you can really tell the difference whenever you try to activate the HiFi feature. The overall improvement of the sound quality is noticeable and worthy to be praised) \r\n- Display (The IPS Quantum 2K display is good enough for a phablet. Colors are sharp but the blacks are not deep. Screen is protected with CGG 4 but it will not protect you from various things that can cause potential harm or produce unwanted scratches on its surface) \r\n- Removable battery (100% in a jiffy through hot swapping. If you don't mind sacrificing the aesthetic of your V20, Zerolemon offers 5,000mAh & 10,000mAh battery for the V20 that bulks your phone) \r\n- Expandable memory (Up to 256GB using a micro SD card. I installed a 128GB micro SD card and with 64GB internal memory, it is more than enough) \r\n- Dual SIM (I got the H990DS version. Legit dual-SIM. Two (2) dedicated SIM card slots and one (1) dedicated slot for the micro SD card) \r\n- Secondary display (Not a gimmick. Reliable, convenient, unique, and somewhat useful especially the Always On Display. You can turn it off anytime though) \r\n- Fingerprint sensor (Works all the time) \r\n- KnockON feature (Useful and convenient) \r\n- IR Blaster (Handy and reliable. Brands and models for household appliances are limited. Can be used for pranks and trolling. Proceed at your own risk) \r\n- FM Radio (Not that useful for me but still deserves to be included on the list)\n \r\nCons: \r\n- Ghosting issues (Good thing it would heal and disappear if you let your phone rest for a while unlike Super AMOLED/AMOLED/P-OLED screens) \r\n- Battery drains quickly (Seriously, only 3200mAh!? Who would want that smfh. Such a bummer for demanding power users like me) \r\n- Heats quickly (Depends on usage) \r\n- Noticeable hiccups and lags (I blame the 4GB of RAM for this. Also, the lack of software updates and optimizations had already taken its toll) \r\n- Force closing of apps (Happened more than twice already since day one. I lost count) \r\n- Front Camera (Overall quality is crap but tolerable. But, 5MP really!? It's 20fuckking17. How disappointing LG. Good thing the wide angle feature is there. Can be useful when needed) \r\n- Software updates (LG is slow on updates. At least give us the the 7.1.1 or 7.1.2 Nougat update perhaps? The V20 deserves an Oreo update asap! Also, firmware updates should be up-to-date and readily available via OTA to all V20 versions, and delays should be avoided at all costs. \r\n- LG UI (Stock LG UI is still sshit. I am currently using Nova Launcher since day one) \r\n- Speakers (Non-stereo. Audio output is mediocre but tolerable to some point)\n \r\nDear LG, life won't be good and our gold stars won't be so lucky if you will not fix these concerns on the V20 and to your future smartphones asap!\n \r\nDespite my due frustrations, kudos still to LG for the existence of this man-made marvel, the LG V20, that has the potential to stand the test of time.", "date": "29 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "Since the moment when discover their whole capabilities.

Just sharing my thoughts and experience coming from phones with sealed 4000mAh batteries or higher.

As I said, at this capacity range, a removable battery is best for a phone's longevity. Once you get to 4000mAh capacity, it wont matter much since battery will still likely be good even after 3 years and by that time, you may have already seen and bought a  new phone. If you plan to change phones less frequently than 3 years, then removable batteries is a must for you but you must buy plenty of spare batteries before they are phased out. ", "date": "21 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "What I stated was a general guideline. It may not be applicable to light users but generally applies to moderate to heavy users. Battery technology has been the same: lithium ion/lithium polymer. They are sensitive to drops and overheating which shortens their useful life. The more deeply discharged a battery is, the greater the wear and tear. Therefore, a 70% discharged (30% power left) 4000mAh lithium battery at the end of the day  which will be recharged at that remaining battery level, will have less daily wear and tear compared to a 3000mAh one which will be 94% discharged everyday (6% power left) prior to recharging, given the same usage level. Even if you manage a day without recharging and only charge a phone when you get home, if it frequently gets to deep discharge levels, it is going to have shorter life than one that is lightly used and gets charged daily at say 30% battery power left. The total battery capacity and usage pattern determine battery life, not the technology which still hasn't changed much in years. My guideline therefore stays. 1. Do not buy a phone with less than 3000mAh battery, 2. If you must buy 3000mAh - 3900mAh battery phone, it shiuld be removable/user replaceable and 3. 4000mAh or higher battery capacity is best as it will wear much less. Between a Huawei Mate 10, a Samsung Note 8, a Pixel XL 2, and an iPhone 8 plus, the Mate 10 is expected to outlive the others in the battery department. Of course if you are a light user with your phone not deeply discharged at the end of the day despite the low battery capacity, then good for you. You can have any phone you want.

This is V20 forum so it is somehow natural that most of us are V20 owners and this is because we love its features and functionality. I love it because of replaceable battery; I travel a lot and even the best battery will discharge after some time and if you are stuck at the airport or somewhere else and want to change the reservation, cancel the hotel or simply call home it is convenient to take a fully charged battery out of your pocket and replace it. What else makes V20 distinctive is a dedicated SD card slot (2 SIMs + SD card slot)  which is a rarity today too. The advantages of other solutions are not acceptable for me but I will not try to persuade others that they are wrong. Therefore let's concentrate on functionality of V20 here and exchange the experience about hardware and software problems, updates and like. \r\nFor hesitant: GSM Arena has a wonderful tool where you can specify exactly what you want your new phone to have, then from the short list, you can select the one which fits your budget the best. \r\nBTW, V10g-AME-XX, the latest update for H990ds, works great!", "date": "20 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "My sealed battery phone is 1 year old now and the battery is still going strong and can still get over 6 hours of screen on time.\n \r\nSo I guess you're wrong because I don't think my battery is going to tank so much so fast in the next 6 months to the point where I'm going to be carrying a power bank or charging twice per day.\n \r\nYou are also forgetting that battery technology is improving over the years so batteries are able to stay fresher longer then what it was like say 3 or 4 years ago.", "date": "20 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "The opposing views on this subject had seem irreconcilable before your post.

Do not buy a phone with less than 3000mAh battery even if it has removable battery. More so if it has sealed battery.  The frequency with which you charge such a very low capacity battery even when new is not worth the inconvenience. After a year when its battery will have lost some capacity, you will be likely buying a new battery if it is removable, or replacing the phone if battery is non removable, or become always tethered to the wall or powerbank if you stick with the phone with worn out battery. 2. If you must buy a phone with less than 4000mAh battery, make sure it has at least 3000mAh and is removable. 3000mAh - 3900mAh batteries do not require charging on most days for most users if the battery is new and if you start the day with close to 100% charge. However, after about a year and a half or so, the loss in battery capacity will be significant so as to cause inconvenience (having to carry the charger or powerbank daily). It gets worse by the second year and beyond so a removable battery is highly recommended for this 3000mAh - 3900mAh capacity  bracket unless you plan to replace phones every 1.5 to 2.0 years. 3. 4000mAh or higher battery capacity is best. The reason is because 99.9% of the time, you won't need to bring your charger or powerbank when the battery is new and even when the battery is 2 years old. The large capacity means that even if you lose some of it through wear and tear,  it will still last you most days of the week even after 2-3 years of use, not like those with lower capacities.  So as you can see, not many manufacturers offer removable batteries or put 4000mAh sealed batteries on flagship phones because they want you to buy new phones every 1.5 years or so.

Between always bringing a small fully charged spare battery or a charger/powerbank everyday, I'll choose the spare  battery anytime because it is so much lighter and pocketable. Once a phone's battery reaches 4000mAh or higher capacity however, it is likely to get me through a full day 99.9% of the time and so the convenience of not needing to carry a  spare battery, powerbank or charger everyday becomes more convenient for me. Also, the high battery capacity means that even if it is sealed, it wont have infuriating capacity reduction or on screen time reduction within at  least 2 years of use. Not so with those flagships with sealed batteries having much less than 4000mAh. They are practically planned obsolescence.

You are also trying very hard to elongate your list of v20 features by including \"USB C\" as a feature.  USB C is a standard, not a feature.  Then there are two mainstream features the v20 is missing which are pretty widespread and possibly even more appealing than having an IR Blaster or FM Radio, and that's waterproofing and wireless charging.  Again, I expect you to reply saying those two features are useless and not necessary for you therefore must not be necessary for anyone, right?  Then there are the other things that are not features, such as aesthetics, design, build quality, and just overall user experience which again may not be important to you who just cares about features, but in fact these things are very important to most consumers.\n \r\nTrying to blame other companies with bigger marketing budgets for brainwashing consumers also doesn't add up as there are other companies with minuscule budgets that have launched widely successful phones.  LG is no small company either, don't forget they also spend tens or even hundreds of million dollars annually on marketing and pretty much all the carriers carry and sell their phones on plans, including the v20.  It's not about brainwashing because In the end, people want to buy a product that they like and will make them the happy.  The car market is exactly the same, you can have a car that cost 15,000 with more features than a car that's selling for 20,000 so why do people still buy the 20,000 car?  Maybe the 20,000 car has better quality or maybe the 20,000 car gets better fuel milage than 15,000 car, who knows.  There are a lot of reasons but one thing is certain, and that's more features alone doesn't make one product better than another and the v20 is a perfect example of that.

I believe the lag is primarily caused by the user's lack of understanding as to what contributes to lag in the Android operating system and how to correct it as more and more apps get installed and uninstalled. Many of the installed apps are notorious for  'running on start up', drawing over other apps, running in the background using data and infesting the phone with pop ups. That's the biggest issue iphone owners tend to tell Android phone owners why they prefer the iphone. Unfortunately, the slow down is just not true. It's due to the user's insufficient understanding on how to optimize the system and what causes the lag.

It would have already ended up in the landfill were it not for its huge (by 2012 standards), user replaceable/removable 3500mAh battery.

I'd say buy it now before smartphones like the V20 (having almost everything) become a thing of the past.

Because of the way I praised my phone, my wife suggested multiple times, why don't I just get a new M8.  They were available online.  I did give that consideration but have not gone down that path yet.  Still contemplating the LG v20 - maybe you want to go get another M8:-) ", "date": "14 Jun 2017"}, {"text": "It's uncommon to see here a meticulous, well builded and unbiased critical post. Congratulations. ", "date": "14 Jun 2017"}, {"text": "I too have been an HTC One M8 owner and have loved it. However, the battery was beginning to fail, so I was forced to go upgrade it (if I could have replaced the battery I would have, but far too complex of an undertaking). I looked at the options available with a removable battery specifically in mind and the only option at T-Mobile was the V20. \n \r\nI didn't love the looks, though it's not as terrible as some people on here have stated in my opinion. I don't really care about the secondary screen, it's alright, but not anything you'd miss if you didn't have it. Nougat is alright, but again, I really haven't found any feature that is 'must have' with it. Double the internal storage is nice, but not really must have either with a SD card slot on both. Double the RAM is theoretically nice as well, though I haven't really noticed it yet in basic use, nor did I ever feel lack of RAM was holding the M8 back at anytime in the past few years. It feels maybe slightly snappier overall than the M8 after the M8 had been used heavily for 3 years. \n \r\nIt's a bit more difficult to manipulate with one hand versus the M8 obviously, but it does have a swipe across the home buttons feature to shrink the visible screen to make one handed use easier. The camera is obviously more powerful overall then the M8's, but I don't like how the entire camera area is raised up from the rest of the body. Makes me uncomfortable sitting it on it's back on most surfaces. A case will be a must and I never rocked a case with my M8. I feel like the wide angle rear facing camera is something I will rarely use, but might be nice once in a blue moon. The depth of field options from the M8 were something I used more often, but not all the time either. The front facing wide angle mode actually is handy though, that is a upgrade for sure. The one thing I don't like about the front facing shooter is even with beauty effects turned all the way down, the pictures are still way too soft. I blame the chicks who want to look airbrushed and blurry in every photo - but it's never been something I am after in any picture, though. Manual settings do not work for the front facing camera, but they are all there for the rear facing cameras and are nice if you know how to use them. Auto mode for the rear produces acceptable shots, but in my testing, tweaking the manual settings will produce better pictures, particularly in lower light settings. \n \r\nThe main thing I care about is audio. Basically, right out of the box, the One M8 sounds superior both with and without headphones. The V20 has one mono speaker at the bottom of the phone and after spending the last 3 years with the One M8 I guess I had gotten so used to it's front facing stereo speakers, that I forgot how far superior they are to pretty much everything out there. Needless to say the difference between the two is night and day in favor of the M8. With standard ear buds, the M8 and boomsound beats the V20 as well, even with the V20's Hi-Fi feature turned on - however, I discovered that the V20 scales it's Hi-Fi output based on the buds/phones/speakers plugged into the jack. If you are into listening to lossless audio formats on expensive 30+ ohm earbuds, then it's likely the V20 will sound better in that scenario. For streaming music/listening to MP3's on standard gear/bluetooth speakers - then it's a pretty clear win for the M8.\n \r\nBattery life so far is much better compared to the failing battery in my M8, but I can see why some people think it is a battery guzzler. It does charge super fast and being able to swap it out for a fresh battery is the main thing that sets this phone apart and also the main thing I love about it. So overall it's growing on me a little bit, but I still find myself wishing I could have just gotten a new battery into my M8. \n \r\nIt's worth noting that they slashed the price almost in half just a few weeks ago, so it was only 480 compared to the 875 I paid for the M8. I won't hesitate to use T-Mobile's Jump program this time around, should a phone appear with a removable battery in the next year that's clearly superior. And nothing made me want to jump out of the M8. So for now the M8 is my backup/work around the house music player. Hope that helps you and any other M8 owners who are thinking about upgrading to the V20.", "date": "14 Jun 2017"}, {"text": "Yes this issue drive me crazy it's half the reason I went back to Samsung.

Then did a recall of all devices in the estimated serial range, by carrier.  Which could easily explain why you had a bunch of trouble, your device may have not been in the range given by your carrier.  These kind of recalls are not uncommon, not really best practice for consumers, but not uncommon.\n \r\nNote 7: After multiple reports of minor phone bursts, Samsung took some notice, no recall.  It was not until after the device was burning cars out, houses down, getting banned from airlines, carriers and some countries, that Samsung finally fully recalled the device.  Then the replacements, ended up with the same issue, to which the recall allowed them (dependent on carrier) to choose another Samsung device or equivalent phone.\n \r\nMy G4 experience went as such...1st bootlooped after 1 year, I sent it in, got a new one in 3 days.  After 1 week, replacement bootlooped...turned out the replacement was also in the recall serial line of my carrier, called back, got a prompt apology from a manager, then they sent me a V10 free of charge, which is still going to this day.  A radically different experience.\n \r\nFunnily if you leave samsung's flagships, and go to their mid range or offshoot devices, the customer support experience is dreadful.  I had a Samsung Captivate Glide (a Galaxy S2 offshoot with a physical keyboard).  The battery swelled (this has been a long running issue with Samsung...excessive battery swell) popped off the back and im out the battery (wasn't many third party options for this device).  Called, and was refused a new one, as they just suspected water damage, wanted me to pay for an entire new device, when all I asked for was a battery.  Radically different experience.\n \r\nWhat still stands is, the Bootloop issue was a G4 problem.  The rest of the devices that are claimed still remain under normal defective device levels in terms of number of reports.  Thereby, people need to stop bootlooping themselves around it on every device...if it becomes a problem, we will know.", "date": "13 Mar 2017"}, {"text": "I want to buy dual sim model H990DS, someone please confirm if the sim2 is 2G only or go in 3G.

It's obvious a suit at the head of LG's mobile division has calculated the cost of recalling and replacing the phones will be greater than the cost of lost customers.  \n \r\nI'm also getting terrible treatment from my LG service center despite already giving them money.  I actually wasn't that upset that my phone bootlooped because I got a chance to get all the data off it.  My attitude has since changed since visiting the LG service center *multiple* times now.  I wish I took the money I gave to them to repair my phone and just put that towards buying a completely new phone now.\n \r\nIt's interesting because up until last month I've been using LG phones for the last 3.5 years now and been nothing but a fan up to this point.  That's all changed now and it's not because of a defective phone but how their service center has handled it.  They could have made it right and made me an even more loyal LG customer.

I absolutely love using the V20 to listen to music with my Sony MDR-7506 headphones. I am not plugging Sony but only mention this to point out that you need quality headphones (not earbuds) with an impedence of 32 ohms or higher to take advantage of the quad DAC.\n \r\nI consider myself a heavy user and my smart phones would typically heat up after prolonged use. It was not uncommon for my phone to hit 104 degrees Fahrenheit or more but the V20 has yet to break 100 degrees. The LG Launcher is very minimalistic and seems nice but I can't comment further because the first thing I do when I get a new phone is install Nova Launcher.\n \r\nI almost forgot. I was totally shocked when I found that the V20 came with FM Radio. I previously found out the hard way how useful FM is when I had no WiFi or 4G LTE and wasn't able to listen to my favorite Sports station. In my opinion, FM should be mandatory on all smartphones so individuals can get emergency details  in the event of a natural disaster or other crisis.\n \r\nYou will not be disappointed with this phone.", "date": "29 Dec 2016"}, {"text": "Stop bootlooping here if you dont have v20 \r\nCant you read the the fact??

So far I love it. Build quality is definitely the best LG has done yet. Feels fantastic and premium in the hand. Nice solid metal build, but with removable battery. Love going back to a extra large 5.7 inch display after using a S7 Edge for a few weeks when the Note 7 got discontinued. The IPS LCD its self is quite beautiful. Yes it dose not not have the \"pop\" that AMOLED dose but it is with out a doubt a beautiful display with great brightness and contrast. No issues viewing outdoors for me. Also thankfully LG has finally greatly improved their automatic brightness, and I actually leave it on all the time.\n \r\nThe second display is more useful than I thought it would be, and far more useful than the edge panel stuff from the S7 Edge and Note 7. Now that I'am used to it and using it for jumping between apps and quick toggles I love it. It's also nice having notifications visible without taking any screen space while doing something fullscreen like a video or game. It of course also works great as a always on display.\n \r\nThe software is great IMO. The latest version of LG's UX, LG UX 5.0+ is a nice refinement of the UX from the G5. They have cleaned up the notification shade significantly. It's excatly like stock Nougat. The overall look is very clean and consistent, with white backgrounds and clean icons. Also thankfully this latest version of LG UX has a full theme engine that is just as extensive as Samsungs. It can modify the appearance of the icons, notification panel/quick settings, settings app, all of the stock/LG apps, and even the LG widgets. Just need more themes to pick from but that should take care of its self in time, and the first user made V20 theme recently appeared on the play store so user created themes are possible and work just like LG made ones. The UX is also extremely fast, snappy, and responsive. I've had zero lag or stutter like I would have every once in a while on my Note 7. Its smooth as butter. And of course all of the Nougat features are fantastic, such as replying directly to notifications, dual window, quick switching between two apps, Vulkan API, faster app installs/updates, small application sizes, etc etc.\n \r\nThe loud speaker is pretty good. It is def very loud, but the sound quality is just average. The headphone jack output however is fantastic. That quad dac is fantastic and makes some incredible audio. I will be getting my free pair of B&O H3 headphones soon thanks to the promotion by LG. Can't wait to try them out with my V20.\n \r\nCamera is of course amazing, as well as video recording.

It should have been placed in the corner. A camera placed in the center to achieve a symmetric design prioritizes design over practicallity, because you are barely able to hold your phone in the natural and stamina game controller grip without covering the camera with your fingers. Additionally, you may touch the lens in everyday use.  And it gets much harder to use the phone as a desk lamp using a horizontal stand case due to the lower flashlight position (traditionally, the camera Flash is played very near to the camera). And it gets much harder to take horizontal photos sneakily (for example: at school, you have to hold at least half the device over the table for the camera to be higher than the table). \r\nA corner camera is also able to invade into every small corner (for example: under a blanket or a cupboard/fridge).\n \r\nHTC and Oppo are getting rid of this design flaw slowly.", "date": "05 Nov 2016"}, {"text": "I purchased the v20 full case and clip before the phone was release from walmart.com...

Jerryrigeverything of course removed the film as well, and purposefully pressed on the glass to try and scratch it, that leaves us with the 2 users.  The other reports claim the LED flash is cracking the glass due to heat, which is plausible, but that's 2 out of how many phones, and we do not know if the protective film was removed by mistake, that is if they're being 100% honest as well.  At this time, we can only take the reports with some scrutiny.\n \r\nThe G5 had a similar issue, yes, primarily because of the similar camera module...however notice the difference in media coverage for the V20, 4 cases and it is almost being treated like the Note 7 explosives (although many people still didn't stray from the Note even after those reports).  The G5 had many more camera glass cases, (I think, many went unnoticed/unreported), but no one was bothered.  The V20 has a much larger opportunity to compete after the Note 7 passed, so of course any minute flaw will be blown out of proportion.

The reason is that V20 has a single piece of glass to cover a large area. And it's a simple physics that the larger the surface area, the more likely it will break. That's the problem. If LG used much smaller camera glass (if each camera had it's own small piece of glass), it would be more durable and less likely to break. There would be less glass surface exposed to the environment to collect scratches and impacts. If it had metal or plastic around the cameras with cutout for the cameras where the two small glass pieces would sit, then it would not break/scratch easily. The metal/plastic around the cameras could also serve as a bump to protect the camera glasses.\n \r\nIt's LG's fault. Both G5 and V20 have the same design flaw. They used an average (i.e. weak), large piece of glass to cover everything. Instead, they should have to use small pieces of Gorilla Glass 5 for each camera, and metal or plastic engineering in the place of where the protection foil now is.\n", "date": "26 Oct 2016"}, {"text": "V20 >>>>> V10 like light's day! \r\nNo worries!

The G4 was a hardware fault in the battery's connection to the board which caused irregular voltages, the V10/G5 had similar symptoms, however the problem was heat dissipation, the temperature sensor would set the phone to shut off due to overheating, then would get stuck in that command until a lower temp was achieved (take your case off or put the phone in the fridge) and voila! it worked again.
