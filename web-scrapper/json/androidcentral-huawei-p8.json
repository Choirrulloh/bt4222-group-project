It's actually the 2nd largest Android manufacturer in the world. It's much larger than HTC or LG, possibly larger than them combined in term of Android sales. \nHowever, note that for Non Pixel phones, Google does not control the updates. This is in part with the fact that Android is open source. The OS itself is free to use by anyone. The only thing Google holds is access to Google services like the Google Play Store. \nWhich is why when you aren't using a Pixel, or a non flagship device, it's sort of understood that you're not getting ALL updates. Supposedly you should still receive monthly security updates, buy I think that's still in the hands of the manufacturer. This is a far cry from say, a Galaxy S5. That's a 3 year old Samsung flagship but it still received a security update last month. Manufacturers treat their flagships well since part of the overhead for it goes to software research costs going forward. They already charged you for costs of software updates you will receive next year. \nThing is with Android, you want to be treated with the same support from the manufacturer like Apple does with the iPhone, you better get the phone that's priced like an iPhone too. Getting the lower end models makes you like a second class citizen. \nIn defense of LG and Samsung though, they have stepped up in their update patterns, and now they also include mid range devices like the Galaxy A series and the LG Stylo series for updates to next Android versions. Samsung went as low range as the top of the line J series (budget series) in terms of updates.
