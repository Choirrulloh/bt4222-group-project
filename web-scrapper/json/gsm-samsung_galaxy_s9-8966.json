In the end, I won't forget how knox only made rooting more difficult and my active died due to water immersion. But the specs were good. I decided to purchase the entire VR package for the samsung S7. First of all, it works. (with a little fan to help cooling) You will lose yourself in a unique experiance that you won't find anywhere in this world. But as time goes on, this feature became a gimmick. As a phone, the S7 revealed a nature that ultimately lost all my faith for what this company believes in.  \r\nThe truth is that samsung fans don't believe that there is anything better because samsung market their products extremely well, so well that even I my had trouble to look away. Unfortunately for samsung, I do understand what a true, user-orientated phone can achieve. My first non-apple experiance was a blackberry z10. If you've never tried a z10, I highly suggest that you should give it a go. Their minimalistic approach, followed by a concise point in all their applications resulted in something practical. Swipe up and right and you pretty much have all your emails and text brought up. Swipe up and left opens the menu. Double pressing volume up and down skips a song and battery is swappable so you don't have to worry about it. Unfortunately blackberry now produce junkfood. Should you be interested, just google blackberry z10 virtual keyboard and tell me how nifty is that.  \r\nAs for the S7, the battery simply won't last for a day. It comes bloated with S home, Sgear, S-every where. Regardless if my mother makes a good application, samsung thinks they can make it better. In the end? All the propiotary apps are unable to be removed. An update later will more than likely re-enable them. Samsung-pay beggs you throughout your week to try it and while Samsung finally found out that they needed more cpu power, they just upgrade the main-chip and call it a S8.  \r\nSimply said, I currently have a Sony Xperia xz1 Compact. Clean android performance with a snapdragon 835. A nostagic attempt in trying to bring the compact factor back into android(reminded me my z10 when I saw it in bestbuy) and, to my surprise, it lasts twice as long as my s7. Yes, I forgot to charge it one night and it was avalible the NIGHT OF NEXT DAY.  It doesn't overheat when I needed to run google play and google maps in my car during the summer and thank god that it won't ask me to try samsung pay every sunday.  \r\ntldr for people who still buys a samsung, just give sony or another company a chance.
