I had a Ringke Wave case on my S9+ since yesterday. And I had a Luvitt glass screen protector. I'd also tested an i-Blason with a built in stiff but thin plastic screen protector as well as a Samsung LED wallet case with no screen protector.\nOne thing I had noticed when I first got my S9+ and used it without a case or screen protector for a couple of days was that interacting with the display was as smooth and fluid as interacting with my Pixel 2. Putting on the i-Blason case was the first time that fluidity got messed up. I had to press down hard to get touches to register. Finally I turned on the setting to increase touch sensitivity and messed around with the setting to reduce response to accidental touches of the edge display. Ultimately I turned that setting OFF. And I got back functionality but typing in that case was not fluid. \nYesterday and today I was using the Ringke Wave case and a Luvitt screen protector. Even after installing GBoard and having the keyboard work normally again there still was a bit of a stutter and odd lack of fluidity in interacting with the display in general. I took off the case but left the screen protector ON. The fluidity is restored. \nI am now using a Ringke CLEAR case with the Luvitt screen protector and it's about the same as not using any case at all. I noticed this case has edges that do not curl over the edges of the phone the way the edges on the Ringke wave case did. \nTL/DR Summary: So I think when using rugged cases in combination with display protectors (or possibly even without a screen protector) be aware any user interface oddities you may notice might be due to your case edges not playing nice with the phone edges and/or the edges of the screen protector. \nRight now Amazon is full of bad reviews on screen protectors and my observations indicate it may not be the screen protectors at fault.", "time": "03-20-2018 12:41 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Battery and charging your phone to 100%", "thread": [{"postID": "post6196876", "text": "So my dad says it doesn't matter if you charge your phone 100% with these phones.

If you have an open text conversation open is Google Messages it will allow you to add a custom notification tone. However, once you delete that conversation, which I do typically to clean up texts, it defaults back to the standard notification tone again. If you use third party contacts or messaging, they don't sync on the Gear Watch app. Also, if you disable the stock contact app (package disabler pro) it then deletes the stock phone app and the contacts in that app. You can't win.

I got my S9+ on Tuesday and so far so good. I was coming from an iPhone X and Pixel 2 XL (both used a little bit for the past four months) and am coming out pretty impressed so far with how the phone handles and the new features and improvements. Lets get into it!\nLikes\nHardware: First let me give a big thank you to Samsung for listening to fans and moving that FP sensor! Aside from that, and the camera on the S9+ being 2 and vertical, it's the same great design of the S8+. The bezel is smaller I guess but I don't notice much, it is much smaller than the Pixel 2 XL and the screen is also about a million times better. I didn't have screen issues with my Pixel, but the quality wasn't great during darker scenes on a movie or video and I got a weird scrolling issue that I had on the two devices that make everything stretch out as I was scrolling and none of that is even remotely present on this display. The speakers are LOUD and sound pretty durned good for my tastes.\nSoftware: I must say this UI is largely the same but with the added benefits of Oreo coming out of the box (instead of an update like with the S8 and Note 8) and it runs smoothly on the SD845. The add ons like Bixby and S Pay work well with S Pay being a star for me. I love getting rewards for using it and it works in a surprising amount of places that Apple Pay and Google Pay don't work. I haven't seen ANY lag at all which is awesome because I noticed a teeny bit on my Note and S8 even straight out of the box. Well done Sam.\nCamera: This is supposed to be the key improvement this year right? Live Focus works well, not quite up to par with whatever the heck Google did with their software but the bokeh looks good most of the time, it's faster than Apple's Portrait Mode by a fairly wide margin and it also allows for editing of the bokeh and the blurriness of the background which is cool to me. The video on this phone looks great, especially in 4K when viewed on a 4K display (like my Samsung 55\" 8800 series in my living room, yes I'm bragging on my display) and is stabilized well and has good sound. The front camera is even pretty decent, though I don't do selfies, I don't like looking at myself a whole lot. The super slow-mo is...cool? Idk I haven't been able to get a good video of something that I want to see going that slow yet. I do love the UI better than the Pixel Camera. I feel like Apple had it right with the whole swipe to get to different modes and Samsung copied them and it works for me, others may disagree though and thats cool too!\nBattery: This one is harder. So day one was setup, obviously the battery went to crap quick with downloading apps, setting up accounts, etc. Day two was a mixed bag but I was also trying to use that horrible Smart Switch to try and drag some stuff off of my iPhone and Pixel, more on that in a minute. Since then though my battery went 12 hours and had 3.5 SOT and my battery was at 38% when I went to bed last night. It is sitting on 82% right now after almost 3.5 hours and about 1.5 SOT so I'm fine with it. It also charges quick, duh, and that makes it draining not a bit deal at all to me. For reference I watch a lot of YouTube and Twitch, stream music and audio ALL DAY at work, like 8 hours+ with the IconX 2018 and I also tend to text, talk on the phone and more quite a lot throughout the day. I don't hold the phone back from anything so everything is syncing in the default manner and I have a lot of location services turned on as well. Basically, I use it, it never dies during the day and I top off at night like most people.\nIntangibles/Misc: I love all of the stuff Samsung still crams into their stuff. Headphone jack, wireless charging, expandable storage, FP scanner, facial detection, iris scanning, Always On Display, variable Aperture, stereo speakers, HDR display, etc. etc. etc. phew! That's a lot of stuff and it all works great and makes it for probably the most well rounded phone available every year.\nDislikes:\nNone\n.\n.\n.\nOkay just kidding there are a couple.\nBluetooth: Randomly cuts out for a second and scares me to death when it does because it makes a loud sound in one, or both, ear buds. Kind of a bummer but every phone I have had recently does something weird with BT so not too awful.\nFP scanner is still a little bit close to the camera. I've rubbed the camera a few times in the 2+ days and I feel like maybe the camera being in the corner of the back instead of right next to the scanner would help. Still way better than last year though.\nBixby button: Nuf said\nThis last one is more of a complaint in general about earbuds and my ears too but nobody makes comfy earbuds for my ear shape. AirPods legitimately made me bleed, Pixel Buds were super uncomfortable, and the IconX are the best fit for me so far but also kind of hurt when I remove them. Luckily, unlike the previous 2, that pain goes away quickly, but it is still weird to me. Not really anyone's fault, just wanted to place it here.\nSo all in all a great showing by Samsung for the S9. I'd like to say I'll hold onto it for awhile but I know myself. I do think that it is incredibly solid and a worthy successor to the S8 and Note 8 as it ticks all the boxes and then some and offers improvements over the previous year. For those wondering, if you have an S8+ and it is still running well, keep it. The S9 is awesome but I wouldn't say it's enough to upgrade from last year's phone.\nHope you guys likes my initial impressions!

Thanks @Jtshurtleff for letting us all share.\nS9+ -- mini overview from my own use:\nThe S9+ SD 845 model G965U1 Coral Blue, no case yet. Disabled most google apps/services except play store and photos. Using bk disabler disabled many of samsung bloat software and certain features I do not use, like the Edge panel, Samsung pay, etc.\nBattery life is excellent. I have a minimalist AOD always on and SOT is at about 5hrs, 2 Exchange accounts, 3 tapatalk accounts, mms/sms/handful of phone calls, web surfing, youtube usage a bit, and about 10 Groove tracks played more or less. Now with total time off the charger of 19hrs or so and I have 34% left.\nThe display is as we would expect. Samsung uses a proprietary driver I believe along with their display service(s) and panel, and the brightness and color modes compliment each other well. The Sunlight readability is pretty good. But I have not assesed all the panel configurations to see which is optimal for my use/needs. It has done some buggy things though, like prior to the latest OTA update night mode was funky and super orange. It would kick in a couple seconds after unlocking the phone each time I unlocked it while enabled, meaning it was turned off at unlock and turned on after the screen got settled. Another is that more than twice I have unlocked the phone during the day and Autobrightness crapped out and the display was completely dim and would not adjust to a readable brightness.\nThe Sound from this thing is top notch. The stereo speaker setup and dolby atmost are just great. I thought the Idol 4s was nice and the most acurate with sound reproduction (without and EQ mind you) but the way Samsung did theirs and combined Harmon speakers just works excellently. And you can crank it loud with little distortion. Off the 3.5mm wire I am still trying to get what I think sounds good to my ear but so far the quality and range are excellent.\nCall quality is great and it has used Wifi calling mostly. It is fast and snappy. The UI works for me. I download a dark them called sd-Black by aire design and it reminds me alot of the Windows Phone UI now. The finger print sensor is fast and accurate. Samsung has a ton of goodies baked into the OS that I am not sure I have looked at even half of them thorougly. I kninda like the one handed mode double tapping the home button 3 times, but it is not ideal imo. I can provide more detail on that if anyone needs...\nThe camera is pretty good. I have not fully used it enough to know how to use it quicky and fluidly. I need a case to be able to hold it appropriately and safely when trying to snap photos. However the few that I have taken are good. In low light it is a good shooter too. I have not really used the camera though to make a complete judgement from y view but it works really well and for my average camera usage it is good. I like that it uses a motion photo feature like living images for photos you take. \nThe phone is a bit thicker, heavier wider and a bit shorter than the S8+. It feels easy to use and should be even better once I get a case. I ordered a spigen liquid air armor case.\nThe one thing that is really impressive on it so far is the battery life. I did disable a lot of stuff. But compared to the s8+ with the same battery size this is good. It should be expected from the SD 845 anyway right?. IMO the standby drain is where I think it excels the most and why the stamina is so good when it needs to be in use.\nIt really is a great device to use for me personally if moving from a Lumia. I just hope Microsoft has an Andromeda-like device lined up soon that can replace this hunk of glass though (sorry just had to say it). Am hoping what they want to do with their new device will be something I and others can use and need for our daily lives to replace devices like this most were forced to move to. I moved off Google entirely except gmail and was happy for several years. Now I have to embrace it a bit more unfortunately. I have not decided what I will do with all my Lumias yet. I will try to provide more about my use with this device as it progresses.", "time": "03-15-2018 08:44 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6193016", "text": "Appreciate the reviews", "time": "03-16-2018 09:08 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6195048", "text": "To the extent that Bixby ever works...", "time": "03-17-2018 10:14 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6195065", "text": "Bixby works great for me.

For reference I was off work Friday, hung out with my son, took my daughter to school, did some cleaning, played outside a bit, did boring stuff until my daughter's Tee Ball game and also went out to dinner. I didn't use my phone a ton that day, took some pics, tried downloading the Pixel Camera, watched a little YouTube and made a few calls and texted a bit. Also played a friend in Magic via Hangouts which TORE UP my battery, like 80% in about an hour, and then recharged in about an hour. Saturday was a rainy lazy day for the first half and then we went outside and went on a walk, took some pictures and videos of my kids and pups, did some more YT watching, tried setting up Kodi and that was mostly it. Sunday was a ton of pictures, outside time, Tee Ball pictures, using Samsung Pay at stores, being out and about.\nSo my biggest gripe so far is the camera. To me, it is nowhere close to the Pixel 2, doesn't do as well as the iPhone in normal shots, and the low light camera lacks any detail. I have a few pics to post and will do so below but I just feel like Sammy took a huge step back here, almost breaking the phone for me. If I can figure out how to get Pixel's camera on here I will and I will keep it but for now it's leaning towards a no because of how much I use the camera. The software has been brilliant though, easily blowing through any process, no bugs yet, hiccups rarely and is genuinely pleasant to use. The battery is hit or miss. Friday, not using it much, I ended the day at about 40% and Saturday, with heavier but not heavy use was at 22%. Yesterday I was at 35% when it went on the charge after using it for pictures a S Pay a bunch. I like the FP sensor a bit more than the S8, enjoy the new speakers and LOVE the screen.

For the Exynos, it's a bit flaky. It works on my Note8 but ZSL doesn't work, meaning that I have to use the \"HDR+ On\" mode, meaning longer capture and processing times.\nAs for the differences in output, you'll mostly see it in color and dynamic range. The HDR+ app will tend to pull out much more detail in shadows and highlights due to its method of processing (instead of bracketing, it takes multiple lower-exposure shots to reduce noise, averages them out and brightens the shadows to compensate) and also tends to bring out colors which can be a bit closer to what we may perceive.\nHowever, Samsung's app works natively with the S9, so you'll get all the benefits and it also has lower noise levels due to MFP. And it's the only way you will get the 960FPS slow-mo feature and the ability to adjust the aperture.\nHonestly, a lot of us can argue over which is better, but the bottom line is that regardless of which app you use, you're using a top 5 or even a top 3 phone camera. You will get more-than-acceptable and even great results from either. It's a case of whether you want the lower noise levels and native compatibility of the Samsung app or the extended dynamic range of the HDR+ app.", "time": "03-19-2018 10:04 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6195704", "text": "A great article that shows photos from both in different scenarios with a slider to switch between the XL 2 and S9+ version of the photo is located here: http://www.businessinsider.com/samsu...parison-2018-3", "time": "03-19-2018 12:47 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6195797", "text": "Honestly, I'd be happy with either.\nThey're among the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of smartphone cameras and unless you're that bad or purposely trying to, it's really difficult to get a bad shot out of either.\nIf I had to choose, probably the S9+ because it's more versatile for me, but if I chose the Pixel, I'd be very happy with it as well", "time": "03-19-2018 02:02 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post6196085", "text": "Can someone post the apk link here", "time": "03-19-2018 07:15 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6196380", "text": "S9 camera is best", "time": "03-20-2018 01:51 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "I have no sound with texts on galaxie s9", "thread": [{"postID": "post6191841", "text": "No sound notifications when receive text message on my galaxie s9", "time": "03-15-2018 10:22 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6192204", "text": "Me either 9+", "time": "03-15-2018 03:32 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6192217", "text": "Have you checked the permissions for your SMS app?", "time": "03-15-2018 03:46 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6192675", "text": "I get them on mine.

I tried \"The Stock Experiment\" after using an international variant S3 before it, and found that I'm bored by stock Android. Despite its speed (which is starting to slow a bit on the 6P), there's nothing to stock. What cemented it for me was my disappointment with Google, in having the gall to ask consumers to pay $1000+ when all is said and done, for IMHO, the inferior hardware of the Pixel 2 XL as a showcase for their software. No thanks.\nThe question now is, do I go with the S9+, or the Note 9? I'm leaving out the Note 8 because, as a female, I have smaller hands and hate the placement of the fingerprint sensor. Now, if you're one who has no use for the S Pen, this won't apply to you, but here is my thinking. The way I see it, the release of the S line of phones is like a beta test. Those that buy it are basically getting a template of a device with features on it that are set to be on the next Note as well, along with anything else Samsung decides to add to sweeten the package. When you think about it, it makes sense, given that the Note line is Samsung's premiere flagship. No other company has even dared to bring a comparable device to the table (no, not even the LG Stylo \ud83d\ude02).\nSo, the \"First World Problems\" question I ask is, do I go for the S9+ when it undoubtedly drops in price this summer, or do I wait for the Note 9 to be released in August/September? I've never had a Note, so I don't know how important the S Pen would be to me, but if I'm going to spend $1000+ when all is said and done, including applicable taxes, accessories and protection plan, I may as well get the most bang for my buck, no? Whether I need it or not, it is a comfort to know that the S Pen is there, should I need to use it. And I certainly don't take spending $1000+ lightly.\nThis is definitely a tough call, considering I'm really liking the Lilac Purple and Coral Blue colors, and Samsung made the adjustments they needed to make with the fingerprint sensor placement and the addition of the stereo speakers. I'm hoping that the audio through a good pair of ear buds will at least be comparable to the audio from the LG V30 quad DAC, or HTC BoomSound. I also hope the battery life and standby time is good. Those two things will be the deciding factors for me.

Not sure if this has caused the burn in cause I know the square should move places a bit to prevent such issues. Before the S9+ I had a S7 edge and had absolutely no traces of burn in. So dissapointed from Samsung, a huge mistake to put a navigation bar on an OLED screen. Few years back when I had the Galaxy Nexus nearly everything has burnt in the display, e.g. app icons, navigation bar, status bar. That was the time when I swore I would never buy a Galaxy phone again. When the S7 edge came out though I couldn't resist it and I told myself I would never buy a phone different than a Galaxy, and now I don't know how to feel.

S9 order last night was no exception. \nAnd for those still wondering why some high end models (Samsung's Plus line) require a deposit now. It's because they changed the JOD policy a while back to allow an upgrade every month if desired. The only way that made business sense for Tmo, is by requiring a deposit for the highest end phones. Makes sense. It's a bummer, but it makes sense.\nLastly, I see a lot of people on JOD concerned with how much a monthly payment is going to be. If you're on JOD, then you should be switching out phones a minimum of 3 times per year, or JOD doesn't make financial sense....so your monthly payment is somewhat meaningless, because it's always going to be in the $30-$34 range for flagships. People on JOD who are going with the Plus model and paying $120 down, need to keep that in mind. Because if you're on JOD, you really should be getting rid of this S9 or S9 plus within 3-4 months, max. Next up for me will be LG's flagship and then the Note 9. Rinse/repeat.

And the S9 supports band 71, which is T-Mobile's future, according to T-Mobile *smile*. In fact, I have the iPhone 8, a fast phone that just works. The iPhone screen is a little smaller than I'd like, but the iPhone Plus is too big physically to fit in a pocket comfortably. When I first saw the bezel-less phones, I figured that was the wave of the future. I was very disappointed that Apple up-marketed their bezel-less model so much that I just couldn't see putting out that much money for a phone. My hope was that they would do what Samsung did with the S8 with the iPhone 8, but no.\nAnyways, loving the roomy screen on the S9, especially for the size of the phone. Configuring it has been a little bit of a challenge, but what's life without a few challenges to overcome *smile*? The phone is fast, has all the features that I need, and enjoyable to use. I'm still getting used to the fingerprint reader on the back, but that'll come with time I'm sure.\nMy only reservation at this point is the duplication of functionality relative to bare Android that Samsung does. I've banished Bixby to the cornfield, and am using Google Messages and Calendar apps, and Chrome. But I cannot disable or uninstall a bunch of stuff that I have no need for, so they just sit there with the phone checking if there are updates for them *smile*. Not to mention that I paid cash for the phone and can't remove the T-Mobile app, but that's another story *smile*.\nGot to say that overall I love this phone.", "time": "03-17-2018 03:15 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "how do i schedule a future text message on galaxy s9", "thread": [{"postID": "post6193631", "text": "I don't see a menu key once I create the message", "time": "03-16-2018 05:44 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6193744", "text": "I\u2019ve seen this question pop up a few times.

Since the S7 headphones let in ambient noise, it's tuned differently. On earolug types, you need to acquire a good ear seal before you start hearing the low end.

At the top is the Dolby Atmos option, which I haven't tested yet because that is for movies, etc. You may have even heard the process in some better theaters who may have 1 screen dedicated for it. I saw the last two of the recent Planet of the Apes films in Dolby Atmos. Incredibly clean.\nBut as far as the buds, I just tested these in the \"real world\" setting of a coffee house with 22 people in it for their morning coffee and chat. As far as blocking out noise, it isn't 100%, but I don't know of any that are. But I will say that I started when the place was basically empty and it wasn't until I took them off an hour later that I was shocked by how loud the place had gotten. That increase in ambient volume in the Cafe was basically unnoticeable with the AKGs in.\nAs far as the music, this was a test for myself, but I sat and first played my favorite speaker test track; Oliver Nelson's Stolen Moments. I first went to the stock genre equalizer presets and the Jazz setting was noticeably more appropriate than the others. Historically, these types of presets have always felt more random or approximated by the software. But not on this. So I left the manual equalizer controls untouched, even though there were a couple of tweaks that I was feeling compelled to change. But the treatments below that are where the real satisfaction comes. For the lushness of this track, I had room to move by flipping on the UHQ upscaler without it getting tinny. And then I added Tube Amp Pro for warmth. I am sure that on a lesser device, these options would have simply canceled each other out and sounded relatively the same as having them both off. But not here. They are performing very distinct functions.\nThe next track was the RVG series' Lee Morgan's - The Sidewinder (you guessed it, I listen to a lot of jazz). And on this track, with Lee's trumpet being (understandably) so far up in the mix, the only Chang that I made was taking off the UHQ.\nBut then I saw this thread and tested a bit more. Moved to Mercury Rev's Dark is Rising, another of my favorite speaker test songs. I moved Jazz to Rock, took off Tube Amp and added UHQ again. It was probably fine, but I couldn't control myself any longer and did very modest tweaks, bringing up the mid and bringing down the low ever so slightly. Then Mudhoney - Baby, Can You Dig The Light (Tube Amp back on). Then Handsome Family - The Woman Downstairs (not that I think that they are pop, but the Pop preset was the only change that I made to make this song transplendent). Then went to the remaster of ZZ Tops Fandango to bounce around between live and studio tracks, just to test out the \"concert hall\" feature. The reverb in the original mastering of this album, already adds a distinct level of depth on the live and studio tracks, which was part of the ZZ Top sound through that era of their career. I wanted to see if the added effect pushed it over the edge or not. So I moved Pop back to Rock and added \"concert hall\" to this already live track; Thunderbird. With the caffeine of my xlarge coffee refill coursing through me, it was hard to contain myself as this was only the second time in my life that I thought that this feature ever sounded right. The first being Bob Marley's Uprising on vinyl in the early 90s through a pair of Klipschorns. I still get chills thinking abould the first song played through these already seasoned speakers; Coming In From the Cold. (note: my current regular buds are also from Klipsch, so the AKGs have had a lot to stand up to)\nI then moved on to my two favorite songs on this album; Nasty Dogs & Funky Kings and Blue Jeans Blues. NDAFK sounded great with concert hall and all other settings the same, but I also played the first minute or so minus concert hall and that would be my preference. And lastly, for Blue Jean Blues, I put concert hall back on and the opening guitar sounded cool, almost haunting. But as soon as the vocals kicked in, it was too animated sounding to continue with concert hall, but the song was pristine without it.\nOf course, I won't be doing this kind of switching around once I find a more universal, personal sweet spot in the settings. In fact, there is even a function at the very bottom that seems to figure that out for you, as well. Maybe I will try it at some point. But if anybody is feeling let down by these ear buds, make sure that you you have given them a fair chance with how they were intended to be used with the S9.\nPeace, \nRas", "time": "03-15-2018 12:52 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6192033", "text": "I find them P1sh.\nThey are \"tuned\" by AKG.

I am not sure if my Lumia will lay unused now or what will happen. I am slowly able to adapt in how use the S9+ in its slight differences and interstingly its similarities. I have used Samsung off and on since the S6 Edge Plus but never daily as my main mobile device needed. I was using Windows phones though primariy for the last 3 years or so...I had to start moving off my Lumia 950 XL due to several factors. Some of which are listed below. Phone call stability and sms/mms for me while on T-Mobile became finicky. Battery life is normally good but web browsing was always a reason to think otherwise, chewing through the battery while web pages are open. The UX/UI of Windows 10 mobile though is so unique natural and simplistic to me that I have attempted to make any aspect of the S9+ mimic it. Yet it will never match that which I grew to appreaciate. Despite this it is just Android and like we know \"different strokes for different folks\". \nAnyway chime in too if you'd like.\nI am impressed by the S9 Plus. Simply put, it for me could and just might replace my 950 XL. I guess I am a bit undecided, but am approaching that threshold of breaking the indecisiveness soon.\nThis device checks a lot of boxes for almost any user...\nThe screen is more than adequate and can be calibrated in many ways - Check\nThe Sound quality off the device and 3.5mm jack are impressive - Check\nThe build quality is excellent - Check\nCellular/MMS/SMS work well for me (T-mobile) with no issues - Check\nSoftware manageability and tweaking from my perspective is great, with lots of features baked in or able to be added through the Android ecosystem - Check\nMicrosoft Services work great on it (Groove, Edge, Exchange etc.) - Check\nThe camera is Samsung's best to date on a mobile phone, for me I have no real complaints with it.

If someone is considering both phones, it is helpful to know how they compare. \nIt doesn't make sense to say that categories should only be considered if the manufacturer makes a claim they are good at that category. So if a company said their camera is not good at focusing, are you saying DXO's review should not consider focusing ability for that camera, so they can get a more competitive score??\n\"WHERE IT MATTERS\" depends on what kind of pictures you take.

The overall score for the S9 is 99, with the photo score being 104. However, if you actually read the scores awarded in each individual metric, the main reason the S9 scored much higher was the secondary camera on the S9+, meaning that it does much better than the P2 in the zoom category. This is a major contributor to why the S9+ scored more. \nIn fact, when it comes to the core photography performance (exposure/contrast, autofocus, texture, color), the Pixel wins, with the exception of noise, of which the S9's multi-frame processing seems to do a good job of clearing.\nThis is a perfect example of why aggregate scores shouldn't be treated as a sole measure of overall camera performance.

But I still can't shake the feeling that this scoring methodology puts a lot of phones with different dual camera implementations or single camera devices at a small disadvantage unless they can make up for the deficiency with superb post processing like the Pixel 2. If a phone has a dual camera implementation that enhances zoom, it's probably going to score more in that area than those that use it differently or only has one sensor.

[{"title": "My S9+ First Impressions coming from an S8+", "thread": [{"postID": "post6190985", "text": "I basically upgraded to get the 2x optical zoom on the camera, but a lot more came with it!  I think the extra 2GB of RAM makes the overall feel of the phone a good bit smoother. I'm running the 8.0 beta on my S8+, so the UI overall should be pretty similar.\nI don't know if it is because it is new, but it is fast. I restored 90% of my files via the Samsung Smart Switch app. I did NOT restore via google restore. I bought a new SD card with more space and faster, but the Smart Switch didn't seem to have the ability to move the stuff from the SD card on the old phone to the SD card on the new one. It just put it in internal memory, so I ran out of space and basically did a phone reset to just start over again.\nThe Intelligent unlock feature works better than just the iris or just the face unlock. I haven't even turned on the finger print reader yet. Just seems like that thing has to take battery power while waiting for my finger to touch it.\nSECURE FOLDER\nDidn't know you could backup your secure folder files to Samsung, so I did so I could restore the files I have in there back to my new phone. Worked like a champ!\nBIXBY and HOME SCREEN\nPopping over to Bixby news feed is WAY faster. The S9 has the ability to view the home screen in landscape mode if you enable it in the Display settings. This also extends to Bixby news feed...it now shows up in landscape if you like.\nMESSAGING APP\nThe messaging app changed slightly. Now it is blue instead of orange, and some of the original settings like background images are gone from the app. This doesn't bother me. I think you can still affect the background in it via a theme. The new messaging app has the ability to click an icon in the bottom right corner to record a voice message to send via text. Pretty cool when you are in a pinch.The dropdown menu that appears when you click the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner while in a text conversation is nicer. It shows the 4 most recent photos received from that contact plus most of the other stuff that used to be there. My S8 has Create Slideshow, but the new phone doesn't. Not sure what the slideshow is...never used it before. Being able to send animated GIFs easily in the new messaging app is nice. The messaging app now shows 2 lines of a message instead of just 1, so fewer messages are seen. Maybe this is a setting somewhere, but I can't find it.\nAR EMOJIS\nAR Emojis just don't matter right now. They aren't as creepy as everyone keeps saying. They just aren't that useful.\nCAMERA APP\nLove the new camera app. It is much more similar to the iPhone app where you can just swipe back and forth between the camera modes. Way easier than swiping to a screen to pick a style. Live Focus creates a great portrait style photo with changeable background blur. It holds onto the original wider screen version because the portrait shot is actually a zoomed up image.\nCAMERA\nHaving 2x optical is pretty darn nice. Low light photos are pretty amazing. I took a picture of a black desk in low light with both. Examples are below. The interesting thing is the S8+ photo size for the photo was 3.31MB while the S9+ photo was 8.18MB. They are the same resolution and DPI. Guess there is just more data in there. There is no comparison. The S9+ took a smooth photo while the S8+ took a grainy photo.\nS8+ Photo: \nS9+ Photo:\nI'll post more if I find more differences that matter.\nEdit 7:12pm\nI totally forgot about the speakers!!! They blow away my S8+. The sound for music as well as podcasts and audio books is amazing. It is loud enough that I don't feel compelled to hook up a bluetooth speaker just so I can hear my book while I'm doing dishes at night. Having sound come at you without cupping a speaker is so nice. I know this has been out on other phones for awhile, but it is so nice to have the all the features I've been wanting in the phone I love. \nI'm in bed with Samsung for their Health App and the tracking via my S3 Frontier and Gear Fit2. They have on wrist detection that pairs whichever one with my phone automatically and blends all the stats into one app... but that isn't anything new here, just one reason why I'm in on Samsung.\nEdit 7:39\nHere are a couple more photos in low light.

I'm 6'1\" with proportionate hands. I've owned huge phones like the Lumia 1500 and currently own a Note8. Just because you can do most tasks with one hand on a big phone doesn't mean it's the most ideal or comfortable experience.\nKeep in mind: It's not just about the width or height of the phone, how thick the device is factors-in as well. You should be looking at the overall volume of the phone to decide if it's the right size for you, not just individual height and width measurements.\nThe S8+ is not the most accurate measure of how the S9+ will feel. The S9+ will feel larger in the hand than the S8+, and is about as much smaller than the Note8 as it is larger than the S8+. \nThe increase in thickness to 8.5mm puts it just about on par with the Note8. \nLikewise, the S9 will feel appreciably bigger in the hand than the S8, commensurate with an increase in both width and thickness. \nMy Note8 had freezing problems, so for the past several months I've been using a Nokia 8. It made me realize how much I missed phones that thin and generally comfortable to hold and use with one hand. \nI found the S8 to feel a bit small and the Nokia 8 just about perfect. The S9 will be closer in volume to the Nokia 8 than to the S8.\nFor these reasons, I'm going with the S9. I took the liberty of calculating the overall volume of all the phones mentioned in this post to give you an idea of how large they'll feel with one-handed use. Here's how they rank (in cubic millimeters):\n1. Note8 - 104533\n2. S9 Plus - 99176.13\n3. S8 Plus - 94829.13\n4. Nokia 8 - 88207.845\n5. S9 - 86249.415\n6. S8 - 81120.72\n7. iPhone 6 - 63843.63\nI, personally, would find the S8 Plus's volume to be on the max end of acceptable for one-handed use. If the S9 Plus was the exact same size as the S8 Plus, I might have gone with that. But my experience with the Note8 tells me the S9's volume is much closer to that ideal in-hand look and feel.\nWhatever you decide, hopefully the measurements in this post help.\n*EDIT: Added the iPhone 6's volume for the OP. One more thing to note, You're already getting a 5.8-inch display with the regular S9... we used to need huge phones for that display size. That's no longer the case with bezel-less displays. You're already getting a huge increase in display size over the iPhone 6 with the regular S9.", "time": "02-27-2018 01:43 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6174077", "text": "I could care less about the increase from 4GB of RAM to 6GB of RAM, but what exactly am I going to miss with not having the dual camera?", "time": "02-27-2018 02:34 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6174110", "text": "Good question, I've been doing some research on that myself. \nBasically, you'll only miss 2X optical zoom.

They're selling it to you in the hopes that you love what they did with the software as it was when you opened the box. \nWell there are three kinds of updates: 1) Major OS updates, like going from Nougat to Oreo 2) Incremental OS updates like going from 7.0 to 7.1 and 3) Security updates. Samsung does 1 and 3, just slowly though on 3 they are still better than most OEM's out there. On type 2 they typically ignore those entirely. 1 and 3 are definitely the most important, with I think most of us in the forums leaning towards 3 as more important than 1. \nType 1 updates are generally bringing new features - however, with Samsung, these can sometimes be features they already had, just with a different implementation that serves only Samsung devices, while the new updates typically does it in a way to get it to all kinds of devices. An example is mutli-window. With the Samsung version, it was kinda jenky and only worked on certain apps, but they had it two years before the rest of Android got it - but now that Android has it, it actually works better and for more apps. As an example of this, Oreo was released last summer and many 2017 Samsung phones still do not have it. \nType 2 updates are generally bringing polish to the major update and lately, for the last couple of years, there has only been one of these updates and it usually follows the Type 1 by only a few months. Call it a finishing update. 8.1 was released 3 months ago and so far Samsung has put it on zero devices, including the S9. \nType 3 updates are monthly security updates, which Google provides the code to the OEM for about a month prior to their release schedule, and then the OEM pushes the update out. That's the one that people tend to get grumpy about. As an example of the issue here, some Samsung devices are on the February update right now, some are on December. March was released yesterday and is already available to all Pixel devices (this year's and last) as well as the last generation of Nexus devices from 2015. So best case scenario, right now, all Samsung phones are at least one month behind. \nThe bigger question is... should any of this matter at all, if users don't care? Most users don't - if they did, Samsung would change their priorities. But updates are not selling phones in any sort of significant volume. For some users this is a dealbreaker, for others it's the last thing on their mind. Similar to how not having an SD card slot is a dealbreaker for some users, while others don't care in any way whatsoever. Just treat it like another feature IMO, it's either important to you or it isn't.", "time": "03-06-2018 04:28 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post6181316", "text": "How do I delete this?

The phone app suggests I switch to PTP mode, and whenever I do this in the dev option, both the S7 and the S9 revert back to MTP immediately. It will not keep that change so I cannot use this app as it just sits attempting to connect.\n- Moving game data across manually: Well, I just don't think I have the access to those files via the file explorer.\n- Various other transfer apps: All fail to actually transfer anything other than a list of apps to install.\nIt seems there is no way I can see to transfer app data other than rooting the phone (which I do not want to do, and shouldn't really have to).\nIs there any way to transfer app save data, or must I reset my gaming life every time I get a new phone?

There are parts that are true, to get the best price you need to have Xfinity Home Internet service. As for phone pricing, Xfinity charges the normal \"carrier rates,\" which may be overpriced compared to a sale price some retailer is offering, but is still priced normally. OTOH, they often have great deals on phones -- such as now being able to get a $250 Visa gift card, though after 4 months, if you purchase a Samsung phone, and the deal includes the S9 and S9+.\nAnd, obviously, since Xfinity sales Samsung phones they definitely don't only support iPhones. I'll give that a half true rank, since if you want to BYOD you can currently only use an iPhone -- though several have swapped the SIM into an Android after the line was set up. Though Android BYOD is supposed to be available soon. Again, though, with this being an S9 thread, for anyone wanting to switch to XMobile, this is a great time/deal since you can get the gift card with the S9.\nLast, obviously the \"best carrier\" for an individual is based on where they live and what plans that carrier has. However, even if you have 5 (or so) Verizon lines and pay less than $45 per line, Xfinity could still be cheaper. The difference here is that with Verizon with their current Unlimited, every line has to be Unlimited. With Xfinity, you can have just a couple of lines as unlimited, with the rest pay by the GB lines. So, while you might pay $40 on all your lines with 5 lines ($200+tax/fee) with Verizon, with Xfinity you might pay $45 for two lines, $12 for two lines (1GB each) and $24 for a third line (2GB); if my quick math is right, $138 for the five lines.\nOne other positive, if you currently have Xfinity Home Internet then there is no hard credit pull when you sign up. Instead, they look at you current Xfinity account for the \"credit check.\" Basically, if you have no outstanding late balance you can buy the phones on a monthly plan (no interest). Also, if for some reason you decide to leave Xfinity mobile, they do not require you to pay off the phones immediately -- instead the phone payments are added to your Xfinity Home bill, making it easier to switch if the service isn't working for you. I should mention that the phones are locked to Xfinity Mobile when you purchase them, but their unlocking policy is basically to unlock the phones on request.\nXfinity Mobile is a great deal, if the plans work for your situation (including being or signing up to be an Xfinity Home Internet customer).", "time": "03-09-2018 04:59 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post6182932", "text": "This is the same question as \"what's the best flavor of ice cream\" with the exception that location matters.

I live in South East Asia, and Google is practically nonexistent here in terms of services. Play Music isn't available, selection on Movies and TV and Books are horrendous compared to say Netflix, and Kindle. Plus there is no official retailer for the Pixel. Buying a Pixel here is practically the same as buying a no name brand in if you're living in the US. Considering the fiasco on the screen and several members here actually going through 3 returns of the phone, Pixels are a bullet dodged.\nFeatures. I appreciate Samsung features a lot. I use them a lot. In fact, I consider the Google apps except for the Play Store as bloat. They're the ones that get disabled on my device. It's mostly Samsung or Microsoft apps that I use. Heck Google's own Messenger doesn't even have the simple feature of pinning frequent contacts to the top of the conversation list, or even see the contact groups I made on my Gmail contacts for mass/group texting. Google's apps are just so lacking in features that from my point of view they might as well be useless.\nBuying Pixel vs Samsung is basically buying a Subaru WRX vs an Audi A4, or BMW 320. Sure the Subaru is faster, but it's seats are less comfortable, there are less airbags, the ride on the Audi is smoother, etc. Sure the speed and capability of the WRX is fun for weekend fun driving, just as the speed of the Pixel is appreciated in gaming.

It might be asking too much of Samsung to replicate the audio from the V30, or HTC's BoomSound. I have seen a video on YouTube showing proof that the quad DAC in the V30 is triggered by headphones with an impedance of 50+ ohms.\nSearch out a video called LG V30- Proved Hi-Fi DAC Works. The guy actually demos what the audio sounds like with the DAC toggled on and off, using a quality headset, then testing the sound again with a standard headset. There is a definite difference in quality. My current buds are 32 ohms, which didn't trigger the DAC when I tested the V30 in store. However, when I tested an HTC phone with the same buds, the sound was awesome. \nI currently have a Dolby Atmos workaround (no root) running on my Nexus 6P. It's not a setting, per se, but I'm able to get that surround sound effect. But by no means am I able to hear every detail and nuance of my music library, the way I do on a BoomSound device. \nThe best way I can describe the sound, is that songs sound deconstructed, and then reconstructed, where you can hear everything from the bass, to each individual instrument, all with no distortion, even at max volume. I love it. I'm guessing the quad DAC on the V30 is similar, if not better.\nThe reason I've decided to go with Samsung instead of the V30 or an HTC is because other than Apple, Samsung is the only Android phone that gets support out the wazoo. There are companies that I've never even heard of that make cases for Samsung phones. Not to mention the fact that should you have an issue with your phone, you can basically take it to any local shop and have it repaired without too much hassle.\nLet's face it, Apple and Samsung own the smartphone space But yeah, since I have music of varying genres, I can't deny being tempted by the V30 or whatever HTC has cooking.

I know it's only a iterative update to the S8+ but Samsung really has fixed all the annoyances of the original that I had. Even looking at the smaller S9, it is ever so slightly wider as to make it more attractive and less elongated IMO. \nThe camera looks very promising already. Coming from the V20 I can already appreciate the spec bump in MP and quality we're getting in the front facing camera. I am going to love taking selfies with my kids on this thing. \nThe screen is amazing. I already knew that but it's exciting to finally be looking at this thing full time in just a couple weeks. The colors are beautiful. Everything is vibrant and the blacks are just perfect. \nThe speakers sound brilliant. I watched a few YouTube videos in the store and I actually had to turn the volume down to just over half way since there were other people looking at phones too. My ears definitely appreciated the sounds coming from the phone. I covered the bottom speaker to see if there actually any sound coming from the earpiece and it sure enough was. The main speaker is at the bottom though. \nThe feel in the hand was very premium and the usual slippery finish but I think I'm going to go with a clear, slim case because I love the look of the design. I'm pretty cool navigating around the camera UI and I recently learned that you can change the shutter speed and focus while recording in pro mode. I tried that as well. I'll have to watch a Samsung camera tutorial as I wasn't able to figure out where the regular slow motion recording option was. \nLastly I'm impressed by Samsung's ability to have new phones available within days after an announcement unlike with LG. They already have commercials for the new phones. I think that's my biggest take away in contrast to LG. Samsung is established and it shows. I think if LG had been able to do some of the things Samsung is able to do with excellence, I could stay with LG but they haven't been able to do that.

You could get a legit 256 GB SD card from Best Buy, Target, Walmart, etc. for a lot less than $200, but it won't be as fast as the Samsung one. If you're just storing photos on it it's probably not a big deal. But if you're going to put your apps on the card, this could become a problem because they won't be able to transfer data into RAM quite as quickly, and you'll notice some lag. It's possible that recording or viewing those snazzy new super slo-mo videos on the S9/S9+ might also be slower.\nApologies for the unsolicited advice here. But what you might consider is getting a Samsung 64GB SD card from Best Buy for just $30. It'll give you great read/write speeds, and should have all the storage you need. For what it's worth, I'm an average smartphone photographer, and I have a 256 GB card from the Note 7 promo. I use my SD card to store all the photos and videos I've ever taken with my Note 7, S7 Edge, S8+, and Note 8, as well as the photos I take with my drone, and I'm only at 34 GB.

The carrier usually determines whether you can use the SIM that comes with the phone or not. With T-Mobile, with a $27 charge for a SIM, you can buy a T-Mobile SIM on eBay for about $3 and activate it with a phone call (if the \"associate\" can get the number correct - mine had to be told about 5 times before she did). With Verizon, if they still work the way they did when I was with them, it's the same thing - you call them to change SIMs. (If you don't have an account with them, you sometimes have to pay an activation fee - if you go into the store and ask nicely what they can do to sweeten the deal to get you as a customer, they usually waive it if you mention it - if you do, you can ask if they can waive any fee to keep you as a customer. If the associate won't or can't, call 611 and ask for the retention department - their only reason for existence is to keep customers from leaving.) AT&T gives out SIM cards like candy - I never got charged for one, and I went through a few when I was switching between phones that used different size cards. When I asked if they had an old adapter they could give me (they're worth about 2 cents), they didn't even bother to look, they just offered me a new card.\nSo, depending on your carrier, it may pay to buy one or it may pay to just ask them to switch your phone and let them stick a SIM into it if they prefer.

[{"title": "My personal initial S9 impressions", "thread": [{"postID": "post6173425", "text": "Let's get this out of the way first. The S9 is exactly as I had expected; An incremental upgrade to the S8's design with an upgraded camera and processor.\nHowever, that doesn't mean it's bad.\nFor one, I don't think the design has aged that much. It still looks good and it is actually quite a bit thicker than before presumably to house the cameras. I personally still prefer the black and silver models.\nBut the camera hardware is probably the mad part. It's mostly what I expected, especially with its dual aperture, but the sensor itself is interesting. It's similar to the S8 in terms of basic specs, which is a 1/2.6\" sensor with 1.4 micron pixels combined with an effective resolution of 12.2MP over a 4:3 aspect ratio. But it now has a layer of stacked DRAM in the actual sensor itself, much like the Sony XPERIA XZ Premium last year, and not only does that give 960FPS at 720p (ironically bested by Sony's XZ2 which does the same at 1080p) but also allows multi-frame processing for up to 12 photos that's tied into the DSP (of which the 845 natively supports). The hardware is superb but it remains to be seen how the software is like.\nOther improvements are expected but no less welcome. The Exynos processor is a CPU champ while the 845 handles GPU loads better. Stereo speakers are always welcome and the fingerprint sensor location is now much more logical and should be better for hands of all sizes.\nThe price, however, actually surprised me. I was expecting a small price bump over the S8, but it's actually largely maintained, maybe a little lower than before (carrier pricing not withstanding). And it seems more countries are getting a 128GB and 256GB SKU for $50 and $100 extra respectively. I hope this becomes a global thing.\nAll in all, a solid hardware upgrade, but at the end of the day, it's an incremental one and while it is a good phone, I'll be sticking with my Note8 since it does everything I want it to do in a manner that's still relevant.", "time": "02-26-2018 11:04 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6173431", "text": "Agree with everything you wrote.

Note 8 or S9+?", "thread": [{"postID": "post6159324", "text": "Hi everyone.\nLet me start by saying I've never owned a Note. My first and only Samsung smartphone was an international variant S3 (i-9300). My mom does have the Note 4 and a Galaxy Tab A which I set up for her, but other than that, it's been stock for me. Obviously this is the Note 8 forum, so people will be biased, but I need absolutely honest opinions. I'm looking to upgrade from my current Nexus 6P. I was all set to buy the Pixel 2 XL, but after holding in my hand at a local Verizon store (before the reviews were even out), I vowed I wouldn't give Google my money. Sure it was fast, but the blue shift on the screen was horrendous, and it honestly felt as light as a plastic toy.\nThen I went and held the orchid grey Note 8-- wow. The screen is absolutely gorgeous, and the in-hand feel is second-to-none, despite being all glass. I'm a female with small hands, though, so the placement of the fingerprint sensor concerns me. The prospect of having to do hand gymnastics with an expensive all glass phone is scary, even if I get a case like the UAG Monarch.\nI do appreciate the fact that Samsung has kept/is keeping the headphone jack, as I do stream my music on GPM often. My favorite audio implementation on smartphones is HTC's BoomSound, though. As far as LG goes, I've seen the perfect video on YouTube that demonstrates how a good pair of 50 ohm headphones really does make a difference with the quad DAC. \nNext concern for me is obviously the battery life, which I've heard mixed reviews about with the Note 8. I'm by no means a heavy user; I'm not heavy into photography, nor gaming. All I do is talk, text, listen to music and forum. So I need a phone that has excellent standby time.\nReception and call quality are important as well.\nSo my question is, do I go Note 8, or wait for the S9+? Or a different phone all together? The S9+ will have the better FPS placement, as well as stereo speakers \"tuned by AKG\". Although I don't know how that will translate to sound through the jack. Will it be on the level of BoomSound or the quad DAC? Screen visibility in direct sun obviously won't be an issue.\nBattery life and standby time will be in question, as will reception. The Note line does have the S pen, though, adding so much flexibility. Even though I probably wouldn't need it, the fact that it's there further justifies its price (although to me, no phone is worth $1,000+ when all is said and done), and it is a comfort knowing it's there if I did.\nThen there's the issue of TouchWiz, Samsung Experience, or whatever they're calling it nowadays. Logic dictates that it's changed since my S3 days, but how much has it really changed in everyday use? Any hiccups or stutters? Does performance degrade overtime? I've seen people say that the battery has.\nTL; DR: I've soured on Google trying to be more like Apple (I don't hate Apple, by the way) and become bored with stock Android. Based on my needs, do I go Note 8, S9+, or something else entirely? I don't take spending $1,000+ lightly, folks, lol.\nThanks in advance.", "time": "02-10-2018 08:29 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6159328", "text": "To me the question is the use of the spen.
