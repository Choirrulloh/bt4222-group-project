[{"title": "I updated my OnePlus 5 to Android 8.0 recently and apps just crash unexpectedly or freeze altogether", "thread": [{"postID": "post6161328", "text": "I didn't know whether to put this in the \"Android 8.0\" forum or the \"OnePlus 5/5T forum\", but I've recently experienced apps either crashing or freezing altogether after updating to the newest version of Android. I usually see a slew of apps pop up with the \"so and so stopped working\" prompt unexpectedly, but the two I can think of right now is Marvel's Contest of Champion and Fate/Grand Order. The crashing prompt will pop up whenever I'm using the phone with other apps or if I've just barely turned the phone on from being off. (This could be due to the newest version of Android just having been officially released to the OnePlus 5 or the apps that I currently use just haven't been updated to support it.) I also had a moment where OnePlus's camera app froze on a picture I was trying to take. It wasn't a full freeze since I was able to back out of the camera and exit to the home screen. I also used Snapchat at one point and my phone unexpectedly turned off while using it. Although this could also be because my phone was about to die anyways. I was able to turn my phone back on and it still had 5% battery left from 15%.\nI've heard that people have used the \"Recovery & Backup\" method in settings or clearing the system cache which the second choice just sounds like a lot of steps to go through just to get to it. I don't know if either option will fix the issues I'm currently having and so that's why I decided to come here and ask. The only other thing I can think of doing is asking the customer support at OnePlus. I haven't really had an issue with getting help from them. I don't know if they'd be able to tell me anything different though. \nAny and all help is appreciated!

These prompts don't appear while I'm using the app thankfully (at least when it isn't having an actual problem causing the app to crash or freeze) so I don't really think that it's anything to worry about.

Recently, I moved to a 5T, which was a huge pain, because I was running 8.0.1 on my 6P, and the 5T had 7.1, and Android is woefully \"short\" in this area, they don't support any sort of \"partial downgrade\" to \"close versions. \nAs such, I had to re-install, after backing up some stuff, like text/call history with tools, and rebuild most of the 5T from scratch (oh well, it runs well, such is life), and the import all the stuff I wanted.\nI had a bit of frustrating experience, again with contacts not recognizing Outlook as a source, but un-installed and re-installed, fiddled with something (trying to recall...), and zip, it \"just worked\".\nPersonally, from a s/w engineering perspective, I think there's a bug in the Contacts setup mechanism somewhere, when you're trying to use things other than G-Cloud, as a source. I'm not motivated enough to fire up a debugger though, and even if I did report it, I'm not sure how motivated Google would be, to fix it (since it mostly works, sorta).\nI bet Samsung has added some more of their \"cloud presence\" to the Android variant too, they seem to think that you \"must\" want to move to theirs, vs. the standard Live/Google/whatever cloud mechanism that you're all established in, IME.\nSamsung makes great hardware, but I'm not a big fan of their s/w mods, or their desire to try and force you into \"their space\" for a lot of things, the \"Bixby button\" is another example...\nGood luck, hopefully this is hopeful, and not just a diatribe...", "time": "03-02-2018 12:57 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post6178200", "text": "PGrey - thank you for all that info and for re-energizing me to start working on this again.

It's just that there are definitely some things that will set the Pixel 2 line (and specifically, the Pixel 2 XL) apart from the OnePlus 5T. And of course, the 5T has things that the Pixel 2 XL doesn't; such as the alert slider (super cool), double tap to unlock, and other cool stuff. It's all about what features are must-haves for the individual user.", "time": "01-29-2018 11:10 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6148796", "text": "I agree with you. It is all about what someone wants.I don't say that pixel isn't a good phone. I am a stock Android fan, don't get me wrong. It is true that pixel is dust and water resistant but that's a certification. It doesn't mean that OnePlus 5t is not.( Maybe not at the pixel level but it is) You can check youtube. At the end you could use your spare money to buy a good case. The truth is that both phones need a case. Pixel due to glass cover and op5t cause it's slippery. Pixel has a slightly better battery but op5t has better charging times due to Dash charge. The advantage of this type of charging isn't only the fast charge but also the \"no heating issues\" while charging. Op5t is less chunky as a phone in your hands. As for the updates...I totally agree with you but take into consideration that not all Android updates are so important(redesigning the app launcher etc and not the power management) if someone wants so badly the updates Android one phones is good solution. Another huge factor is the market. For example US market is linked with Google and apple and carriers don't make agreements with other brands (ex. Huawei failed to make an agreement with Verizon for the Mate10pro which is maybe the best Android phone and Im not talking about benchmarks. I don't like it because of EMUI)\nIt all about what you want. Some people prefer the appearance others prefer photos. As a user I want my phone to run smoothly. You can find numerous reasons to justify your purchase but that doesn't mean that the price is justifiable . Pixel is the leader. But not 300+ better than op5t.

I haven't downloaded any antivirus software and am relying on whatever resilience OnePlus build in with thier Oxygen OS. Maybe a bit naive but I feel secure.\nI think you'll love the phone. It's a great device. However, from a security perspective there is one thing to be aware of and it's the app store.\nThe first thing that struck me as a new android user is the sheer number of apps in the store. And I don't mean that in a good way. It's frankly overwhelming, and trying to find ones that are from reliable developers is difficult. It feels like total hit and miss.\nFor example, I was looking for a password safe app. As I'm sure you can appreciate, password safe is one of those apps you don't take a chance with. It's got to be rock solid and extremely secure. If someone cracks it they'll have access to every password, bank card and internet login you own.\nIn the windows store there are about a dozen password safe apps and all have been authenticated by Microsoft. In the Google play store there are thousands, and some of them are clearly nothing more than an individuals pet software project.\nUltimately, what I've decided to do to stay secure is to stick with major developer apps. So my phone has a very Microsoft feel to it. I've downloaded the Microsoft launcher, office, edge, news, weather, etc all from Microsoft so I trust they're secure.\nI'm sure Google do a lot of store screening and purging whenever they find dodgy apps, but it still feels like you're walking around central park at 3am with your wallet hanging out of your pocket.", "time": "01-05-2018 09:58 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6127707", "text": "Thanks Jcmg62 for your information.

It depends on the user - some will want the extras and the bells and whistles; whereas others may want *some* flagship specs, but will sacrifice on other specs that aren't as important to them.\nHowever, that is not to say that the OnePlus 5T is a bad phone.

But that's not just with the 5T, it's with any smartphone on the market point blank period. But there's more to it than pound for pound. I love the note 8 cause of the features it offers. Plenty of features that aren't necessarily in your way but when needed you can use them. I love that. Also the vibration motor of the note is much better than the 5T's, the camera is better and the water resistance is a big plus. As far as the 5T, I love dash charging. That is my favorite feature of any phone ever. I just freaking love it. Also I love that the 5T is half the price yet can compete out there with the best of them. I like the face unlock, I LOVE how speedy the phone is, it's really a speed demon although the note isn't too shabby either. I like that the 5T size is more manageable, lighter and easier to hold and I also love the fact that it has a screen protector and a pretty damn good case out of the box. \nAs far as the display goes, they cancel each other out....to me. I don't care for QHD, I always use my note on 1080P and to me the 5T is just as good. Maybe the note is better at 1080P but it's so minimal that it doesn't matter to me. I don't give 2 f*cks about wireless charging so it's not a pro for me. I love both skins. The features of the note 8 and the light skin of the 5T while still having some cool features, gestures and dark mode etc... They're both solid phones. The note 8 is superior overall but it's also more expensive. The 5T is a phone that truly challenges these $700+ smartphones. It really makes you question yourself about going out and spending that much money when you can get something almost as good if not just as good for half the price. \nSide note, I had the pixel 2 XL too, I prefer the 5T hands down, no debate. the pixel has a great camera but besides that I prefer the 5T. The display is better, more Rams, better battery life, performance is on par but I'll actually give the edge to 5T cause of more ram and the ability to keep more apps in cache and last but not least, the price. again, you spend $800 on the pixel then spend $500 on the 5T, you'll hate yourself for spending that much on the pixel cause it's totally not worth it Imo. just my 2cents.", "time": "01-14-2018 11:13 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "LED indicator color by app", "thread": [{"postID": "post6131392", "text": "I've been able to find out how to change the colors for general alert indicators and charging status, but I thought there was a way to set a color for a particular app. I see the app-based controls for whether an app generates a notification, but nothing about the color of the notification.

I set up my phone, installed the 474 update, set up google play apps and google assistant, took 40 pics, surfed out my News for the day and played about 1 hrs worth of flac music, so I totalled about 3hrs SoT... and Im still at 60%.. Now thats good . \nAudio through the Speaker is Very Loud and surprisingly good for a single speaker, but the headphone jack is excellent... nice and punchy with tight bass but not OTT treble, sounds smooth and music hangs together well.. I tested it with a set of LG QuadBeat 2s, Sennheiser 455s and the AKGs from an S8... the AKGs take some driving.. but all sounded fantastic. One thing though,, I was getting a little interference and crackling in my headphones when I touched or moved the headphones plug, although it didnt cut out. Anyone else?\nNow to my main question.. the camera.. I am actually a street (candid) Photographer and I own a Canon 1300D and a Nikpn DSLRs, so i like to think i have a reasonable eye ... but Thankfully, under OS 474... I can say that IMO.. the 5T camera is good, in fact its very good.. even in low light.\nI would be happy to take it as a quick point and shoot on a day out, and even though, 1+ removed the Telephoto 2x lens.. the 2x software mode is great.. with no real loss of detail that I can see, Dynamic range is fantastic... I took a statue with the blue sky in the background and it captured staggering amount of detail in the statue itself.. images are detailed, but distance objects can look a bit \"mushy\" rather than just out of focus.\nTheres no barrel or image distortion on the outer edges of the images (ala xperia z5), but like all wide angle phone cameras you will lose detail at the edges, but as long as your subject is in the centre, that isnt a problem., however..... \nIn portrait mode, the Bokeh background looks a little \"mushy\" and rarely in some cases the whole image looks as if it has camera shake, your better off just \"Tap to focus\" and let the camera EIS do the work. also there is minor light streaming and star-burst effects from street lights, which i think has had some attension in the update, but still needs work. \nOn the whole, to my eye, the images remind me a little of the Huawei P10+ and can look a little flat and lifeless and the camera needs a warmer White Balance (which can be added in Pro mode).. but this is only to my eye.. \nBut its this \"mushy\" look on distant objects (its like looking out of a rain soaked window) when the object is out of focus instead of that out of focus Bokeh. If 1+ could look at that, that be great. \nBut on the whole.. a fantastic device with a great camera and ill be keeping it for a year or so because as \"barondebxl\" said above.. these issues i have can all be fixed with software updates, ao im happy to wait and see....\nUnfortunately, YouTube and reviews have alot of people neurotic about their phone cameras.. constantly comparing images of their pictures zoomed in 500 times and because the Pixel 2 xl has a millionth of a clearer image than the S8 or U11 then its the best/worst camera going.. which is silly and pointless as megapixels means nothing in a great image. \nIMO, The truth is.. its the subject in the foreground that counts, all else is just waste..\nI love my 5T and its worth every penny", "time": "12-12-2017 06:15 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6105258", "text": "I'm glad you like it, it's a great phone without a doubt.

I know you said you didn't really mind about camera or storage; but what about things like screen size, battery size, etc? The Essential Phone is 5.71\" and the battery size is 3040 mAh; and the camera experience is supposedly excellent. The OP 5T is 6.01\" and the battery size is 3300 mAh.\n- What do you use your phone for? Do you watch movies, play games, or do a lot of web browsing? If you do, then you may prefer the bigger screen real estate of the OP 5T (and users have said that, though the size is bigger, it still fits really well in the hand and doesn't seem that much bigger than its cousin, the OnePlus 5) and the larger battery size to compensate for said activities.\n- What phone do you see yourself using for the long term, or until you upgrade next? Also, which phone do you think you'd love to look at for that long (you'll be looking at this device for at least a year or more, on average, perhaps)?\n- Review videos: watching review videos and unboxing videos from YouTube (look for channels like Android Authority and Android Central) will give you a better idea of how the phones operate in day-to-day use and how they'd potentially feel in the hand for you.\nIt's a tough choice, for sure!

As part of the Android Central Community Review Team, I got the opportunity to review the RhinoShield Bumper Case for the OnePlus 5. I have been using this case for a month and here is my review.\nUnlike cases from other manufacturers, RhinoShield takes a unique approach to building its cases. What you get is just a bumper case without any back cover. \nWith the combination of soft and hard shell around the top, bottom and the edges, RhinoShield promises to provide drop protection of at least 11 feet/3.3 meters. The hexagonal structure in the case interior also helps to give that maximum protection. \nThe easiest way to install the case is to slide in from the top first and then the bottom. Once installed, the top and bottom feel firm. \nHere is how the front looks after installing the case.\nHere is how the back looks after installing the case.\nHowever, the sides feel a little flimsy. They are loose enough to pull. This does not happen with the top and the bottom. \nThat said, the sides do have a good grip so your OnePlus 5 won't accidentally slip from your hands. \nAnd if you plan to remove the case, you should know it's not that easy for good reasons, which again shows you that your OnePlus 5 is well protected in the case. To remove the case, slide out the top first and then the bottom. \nThe best thing about this case is that it has well-raised lips both on the front and the back so that it protects both your screen in the front and the camera in the back of your phone. \nThe cutouts for the buttons fit well and are easy to operate. I was able to use the alert slider without any difficulties. In fact, I found using the alert slider with the case easier to use than without the case. The volume buttons, on the other hand, might take a little time to get used to as you don't get any feedback and also due to the sides being flimsy, you will find it difficult to use initially.\nI love the bottom cutouts for the ports. The cutouts are raised and have good ample space so you can easily use the ports without any difficulties. \nOne other good thing about this case is that it works well with my screen protector. I am using the BIUZKO Full Coverage OnePlus 5 screen protector and have no issues using it with the bumper case. With this combination, you should get good protection for your OnePlus 5. If you use skins, like dBrand or Slickwraps, then you should be happy to know that the bumper case is compatible with those too.\nI am still getting used to using RhinoShield's bumper case full time, but so far I like it. You definitely need to build that trust with the bumper case especially when the back of the phone is exposed. I am still cautious when I place my phone down, especially in non-flat surfaces or rocks as it might scratch the back. \nThe only big thing I don't like about this case is how flimsy the sides are. I am hoping that's for a reason to give you that protection and absorb shock from drops, but I am not doing a drop test to prove that. \nIf you are looking for a simple light-weight protection for your OnePlus 5 along with the choice of your screen protector and back skin, then RhinoSheild CrashGuard Bumper Case is an excellent choice. If you are not comfortable with getting a screen protector or a back protection, it should still be OK but I wouldn't recommend using this case without that. \nYou can purchase the bumper case directly from RhinoShield's website for $24.99.\nLet us know what you think about the case!", "time": "10-06-2017 12:11 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6021582", "text": "Hi Bro,\nI too ve ordered a Rhinoshield Bumper case.

The two skins were the Mahogany wood (back and camera lens cover) and the Hyperblack Titanium (back with red camera lens cover and red 1+ logo). Even though I wanted to add the front Mahogany skins the fact that I've also ordered the Ozly tpsp screen protector made me realized I'd have issues whenever I needed to replace the screen cover.\nAttached are pictures of both skins with accessories un-applied and the Mahogany skins applied including the camera lens cover. Notice that the two Mahogany skins have different wood patterns. Running your finger over each skin I realized that the Mahogany adds almost no additional grip to the slippery naked OP5 while the Hyperblack Titanium skin has more texture which I believed would add more grip. This is not to say that once applied the Mahogany skin did not reduce the overall slipper feel of a naked OP5, as it did. In the future I'll likely try the Hyperblack Titanium but right now I really like the Mahogany's overall look the best.\nI still bought a cheap clear plastic case which is currently on a slow boat from China. I'll use it when I'm going someplace where accidents are more likely such as camping or a party. These skins are so thin that I don't anticipate putting the case on to be an issue. \nThis is the first time I've every bought or applied a skin as I've previously only gone with bumper cases. Over all I think the application went well but I certainly don't have the corner flaps applied as well as seen on dBrand's OP5 application video. Most definitely you need a hairdryer during application as I had a bubble under the skin and heating that section and the bubble's path to the outside saved having to peal the skin off to start again. It works much like you push bubbles out from a clear plastic screen protector. Getting the initial bottom alignment applied properly is the key to the rest of the application. Mess that up and you alignment issues multiply. Heating and stretching the skin is dangerous and only helps with the tiniest of misalignment.\nThe dBrands fit overall and specifically around the buttons is as perfect as a mass produced item can be. In conclusion, if you choose to use a skin you'd be hard pressed to find a brand with a more accurate fit.\nP.S. For grip the Carbon Fiber would likely be your best bet but I thought it was butt ugly so went another way.\nEdit: Added top, bottom, right and left side pictures.", "time": "09-16-2017 10:20 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "how to change chinese version of oneplus 5 to english version", "thread": [{"postID": "post5946933", "text": "I have a brand new oneplus 5 phone purchased in China, all the apps are in chinese even after I change the language to English, even the browser, Is there a way to convert the apps to english version?", "time": "08-30-2017 03:22 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5950010", "text": "Welcome to Android Central!

I do not think it is a bad phone, by any means, but it is leading the industry at nothing and not improving on the things that are some of it's biggest issues (in my opinion, etc, etc): \n1) Camera is still apparently way behind the devices it wants to call peers \n2) dash charging is cool, but the device still doesn't support USB-PD \n3) The obvious iPhone rip-off is not acceptable and they should know this \n4) OxygenOS has SO much cool stuff about it, yet is still behind on being properly supported (see OP2) and is not getting security updates with enough regularity to believe they are taking it seriously \n5) Over half of US consumers are still left in the cold by this device due to lack of support for Verizon & Sprint \n6) 1080p display - I get the sales pitch, just don't agree with it \n7) Front facing FPS - this is something I've always disliked (until they find a way to make it invisible and not associated with a navigation button), but I really believe it officially died this year when Samsung finally got rid of their FFPS. Get that button out of there! \n8) Devices this year have things about them that make them different. This one doesn't, unless it's the price tag. Price tags do not increase the quality of phones, they increase the value. We need something that differentiates in a way that increases quality. \n9) I can't figure out who their target audience is. Do they honestly intend to compete with the S8, G6, etc? Do they think this will compete with this year's iPhone? It seems to me to have more in common, from a design philosophy standpoint, with the Moto Z Play. Is that the target audience?\n10) Excess RAM. RAM must be cheap; and in China, it's SUPER important to have as much as you can throw in there - that's a thing people pay attention to in that market. But we have devices that are incredibly smooth with far less - what are we trying to accomplish with more RAM? Is there a real need? Or is this a bandaid for something that should be actually solved, rather than covered up? Hard to know - but it is something that isn't an issue in several other devices, so why is it an issue here? Is it for futureproofing? Why? These phones aren't supported (see OP2). \nObliviously I haven't gotten to use one yet and I may amend this once I get a chance to.

I think we ought to start being slightly more critical. Here's why.\nEvery OnePlus flagship has creeped up in price over the last one.

If they could have spent the last year figuring out a way to still give their benefit while also supporting power delivery Etc then we'd be totally good.\nBad software comes up due to lack of support for seamless updates, late firmware updates, abandoning the OnePlus 2. Reviews of the OnePlus 5 have indicated that there are still some bugs and stuttering throughout the OS, however it's not clear on if they're saying it's worse than other devices or just that they exist. This is going to be something that needs to wait until we can actually use the device to figure it out. For me the benefit of the doubt does not go to OnePlus because of Prior Generations.\nFor security I listed it as poor because of the inconsistent support for monthly updates and the lack of a commitment from the company to support monthly security bulletins within 24 hours of them being made available for public release.\nThe fingerprint scanner is definitely subjective as far as where users want to use it, however I am going after it for a different reason which is one of design. It is in my opinion not okay to still be releasing devices with capacitive buttons. For 2015 devices I was willing to give the front-facing fingerprint scanner a pass if it was the home button and the other two buttons were on the bezel next to it. In 2016 that seemed to be the direction that many wanted to go with it and I do believe that fingerprint scanners are going to come back to the front as companies learn to put it below the display. For a 2017 device a front-facing fingerprint scanner is just outdated. But that's just my opinion. The second thing about the fingerprint scanner though is that the OnePlus still has both software and capacitive keys available to the user. In my opinion this is a mistake and OnePlus should choose one or the other and go all in with it and adjust the design of the face of their device accordingly.\nBut again all of these things are meant to be taking as these ten things together and not as a list of individual things about it.", "time": "06-22-2017 12:54 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5859646", "text": "I personally like having the choice.", "time": "06-22-2017 12:58 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5859721", "text": "Other than Google, what other company has this magical 24 hour release?", "time": "06-22-2017 01:54 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5859727", "text": "TCL's BlackBerry devices are still doing it; several companies will get some of their phones done within that period but they all get strikes because it's not all of their devices.", "time": "06-22-2017 01:58 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5905460", "text": "And Qualcomm's solution isn't a \"standard\" either, but proprietary, as much as OP's is.\nUSB-PD is the only one with with a standard.\nA lot of your dismissal is based purely on personal opinions.\nFingerprint scanner position is entirely personal preference.\nYou seem to contradict yourself saying that the front scanner is a problem, while acknowledging that is the way it is going in the future, albeit under the screen rather than adjacent to it.\nThe awkward placement of the scanner on the s8 makes it clear that the rear scanner was a last-minute compromise rather than a choice from the start, one forced because the bezel-less screen could not at that point accomodate the underscreen scanner.\nAs is the capacitive buttons, as I am not a fan of inconsistent button presence on the screen.\nIf the individual statements are a problem, so is the list overall.\nAnd so much of that isn't based on facts.", "time": "07-30-2017 10:38 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5905495", "text": "This is correct until QuickCharge 4.0 which the SD835 supports, but so far no one has implemented afaik.

The sensor is a 1/2.8\" diagonal CMOS sensor with a maximum resolution of approximately 16 megapixels with an individual pixel-size of approximately 1.12 microns. Like its predecessor, the sensor features PDAF, although the 398 features a dual-photodiode tech first used on the Canon EOS 70D and Galaxy S7.\nSmaller sensors aren't always bad on their own, but higher resolution on a small surface area leads to smaller pixels, which means that each pixel is unable to receive sufficient light, resulting in poorer light sensitivity. The smaller pixels also mean that dynamic range is limited as the pixels can be more easily flooded. Smaller sensors and pixels combo also take more of a beating in low-light, and it's also worth noting that an f/1.7 aperture on a 1/2.6\" sensor is larger than the same f-stop aperture on a 1/2.8\" sensor.\nThe interesting part is the sensor used in the secondary module; the IMX350. Same sensor size as the IMX398, but has a higher resolution at 20MP, and as a consequence, smaller 1-micron pixels. From all the reviews, it seems that the theory I mentioned above holds true.

And like I always say now with phones, there is room for improvement on every phone. And Samsung can certainly afford coupons, sales, and flagship specs due to its million dollar corporation. They don't just sell phones - they have an arsenal of revenue from TV's, fridges, and other appliances/electronic gear at their disposal. When you have revenue from other products, it's way easier to shoot for the stars with high-end specs.\nI'm not making excuses for OnePlus, but I am saying that since it's a smaller company, it's harder for it to really push the envelope; compared to big corporations like Samsung and Apple. But OP's big theme is \"bang for your buck,\" and so I still think it's doing a great job in the cell phone market.

Having said that, I've tried many of the phones on the market. My go-to phone the majority of the last two years has ended up being one of the Samsung S or Note series.\nI bought the OnePlus 3T for my mom when she needed a reasonably priced phone with a dual SIM that has a great screen, isn't too big, and has good performance. I used it for about a week, and came very close to switching away from the S7 Edge and Huawei Mate 9 that I had at the time. I found the 3T screen excellent. I personally couldn't tell the difference between it and my S7 Edge screen and it was leaps ahead of the Mate 9's (still pretty good) LCD screen. \nThe thing that almost got me to switch was the sheer speed and memory management. The 3T was for what I use quicker than the Pixel XL. Frankly for normal day to day use, I believe it was and maybe still is, the quickest Android phone available until the OP5.\nThe camera was the only reason I didn't sell both the S7 Edge and the Mate 9 (I sold both for the S8+).\nI find myself now again tempted to get the OnePlus 5. I think the 8GB RAM is overkill, but 6GB is not. Apps just stay in memory forever. I love that I can switch back to an app and it's pretty much always still loaded and available for immediate use. Oxygen OS is basically what I would do if I were able to create the perfect custom ROM on top of the standard Pixel experience. \nSamsung's screens are gorgeous and the one on the S8+ is even better than the S7 Edge. Their OOTB software like email client, calendar, and Contacts has actually become so good over the years that I don't bother switching to alternatives for the most part. I love Samsung Pay, and of course I love the design, etc. But when all is said and done, I still routinely find it to be annoyingly slow, and while lag has improved dramatically since the days of pure TouchWiz, I still have to reboot daily and wipe the cache partition weekly just to have less lag.\nSo I'm going to try out the OP5. I'm disappointed by what I'm reading about the camera, but my experience is that no matter what reviewers say, whether it's good enough for me or not is something I'll determine after using it for a few weeks. \nSo I'm getting my OP5 on Monday and going on a vacation to South Africa (where I grew up) on Friday. I'll take the OP5 as my primary device. My wife has an S8, so worst case, we'll use her phone for photos. I'm fairly optimistic that I'll prefer the OP5 ultimately.

You know how you add an additional Google account and it automatically syncs everything!(ugh) And you try to click into the account to stop the sync of all the irrelevant data (I just needed my app data from this particular account) on other devices it usually freezes and doesn't grant me immediate access! I have to close out and go back in - not with the 1+! Let me right in lol\n*The fastest I've ever setup a device - no bloatware!! I did disable their contact app and just downloaded Google's- I will compare their messaging and gallery app - if I don't like them I'll disable and just use Google's\n*I am seeing the inconsistencies in the WiFi - it seems to stall but once it's connected it zooms - I'm syncing some 23gb of music - the WiFi hasn't dropped - I only noticed it hang in the play store and downloading an .apk from Gmail - I'm starting to think Google is the issue not so much the phone but will check later - I did go into WiFi and I went with 2.4 at first based on what others said but noticed the aforementioned so I forgot that network and went with 5ghz and went into advanced settings and selected 5 only versus automatic - connection seems stable as of now\n* I haven't played with any other settings yet (cooking dinner for the hubby) but will today or tomorrow - if I don't like the camera I'll just use my dedicated camera or hire a photographer \n* The fluidity, feature rich but lightweight skin is amazing - makes me wonder why so many android oems weigh down the OS - now that I've experienced this it will be hard to tolerate Samsungs shenanigans - albeit Samsung Pay is awesome!\n* Finally, the unboxing experience was amazing the box has a nice heft n feel and I enjoyed that - the feel of the device is amazing! I've never held an iFone 7+ but aside from the similarities in aesethetics peripherals these are two different build qualities and design elements - the pictures and video don't do this phone any justice - it's not a taller aspect ratio but it's curved in a way that makes it feel \"tall\" comparing it to my G6 which is great to hold on phone calls - this device is ever so slightly wider and it reminds me of holding my G6 - so far I'm excited and I got a free $20 case which feels nice as well - I don't use cases though - I like nude devices and if I'm out I'll get a holster or just put it in my purse but cases take away the feel of the phone. - did I mention the screen was awesome - amoled is the way to go - I love the red cord - I like the notification led the G6 and Moto devices don't use those which they should - the weight of the device is solid and seems heaviest around the circumference and hollowed in the center but it feels great though - its been syncing the sum 5k songs now for I'd say under 45mins and it's already at 2500 songs - not bad at all. - over 4gb of RAM out the box ready to use - I love the built in recorder app - will also check out their file manager or uninstall if I don't like it - ummmmmm I love the simplicity this is what a phone should be- let the user add their own customizations! Without limitations! - I can't stop picking it up it feels so nice in the hands! Looking forward to using dark theme and tinkering with all the settings - as of now this is a win 9/10 if I'm being petty - 10/10 if I'm being realistic - just opened the camera - looks quite clear to me in my home office - not saying others issues or concerns aren't valid - I will have to spend more time but as of now I am very satisfied with my purchase, the shipping, up to date tracking, free case, value, etc. Perhaps I'll convenience my husband to get one lol -I didn't have any expectations (I rarely do I know better lol its life), I think part of people's disdain is because they overly bought into the marketing, mix that with cognitive dissonance and expectations aren't met because of how you told yourself to think - much like year after year Samsung users complain yet they keep giving them their $ - lol\nRegards,\nDr.J\u00e9", "time": "06-29-2017 03:24 PM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"postID": "post5906792", "text": "I wish I had the money to buy one", "time": "07-31-2017 12:02 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5908163", "text": "Same here love the way it looks and performs", "time": "08-01-2017 12:59 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5908230", "text": "Torn between this and the U11.

Then the other flagship devices in the market are mostly pretty good this year, so it makes the compromises on the OP5 a little less tolerable too. Like the lack of water resistance, and the camera is no where near what OnePlus hyped it up to be. And of course at this point, prices of some other flagship devices are coming down in price (at least where I live). So a 6GB OP5 costs around the same as the LG G6, and only around 150USD cheaper than the Galaxy S8.

It won't bother most but it's something to note. The camera is also good but not to the degree it was hyped. In most conditions, it will deliver a solid photo but I wouldn't recommend using the zoom lens in anything other than good lighting as the smaller pixels and smaller aperture lead to more noise and as a result, heavier NR.\n$540 is actually not a bad price at all for the specs you get, but that also means it's getting some competition from some actual flagships.

He uses exactly the same tests each time and the same format. You can see for yourself the photos and videos and decide which you think is better. My conclusion from his review is that the cameras for the most part are both good, with the S8 having a slight edge for low light. Video at 4K is a very clear win for Samsung, but at 1080P/HD it's a win for the OP5 or a close tie. \nDaylight shots are pretty much on par but some people will prefer one over the other.\nSome of the OP5's weaknesses are made up for by having the zoom if you feel that's useful.\nFor me, I've got an S8+, and bought the OnePlus 5. I know what I use my phone camera for. I do use video a lot, but 1080P is more than sufficient for me. I do very little low light photography and the OnePlus is very good at that even if not as good as the S8+. \nI love the optical zoom. I loved it on the iPhone 7 Plus I had for a few months. Overall, I think the camera will be more than good enough for me, and way better than the OP3t, and I am convinced it will improve with a software update very quickly anyway since OnePlus listens to the market and reviewers and fixes what they can with software. That's why they did that with the 3t.\nTo me, the performance difference is worth switching to the OP 5.

The resolution for green is equivalent to a 1080p display, and subpixel rendering is what allows you to make the claim that it's still a 1080p display, but for everything except pure green your effective resolution is going to be lower. In addition to that, the uneven size and spacing of the subpixels, along with their diamond pattern, makes them less than optimal for rendering the latin alphabet which contains many vertical lines. This kind of screen door effect has long been noticed on PenTile displays, and for the most part the push for 1440p AMOLED panels has mitigated those complaints.On the OnePlus 3 it's pretty obvious that text is rendered less clearly than the iPhone 6s, which has a pixel density of only 326ppi, well below that of flagship Android devices. With the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2 for comparison it's completely obvious that the OnePlus 3 has a lower effective resolution, with text exhibiting distracting artifacts, and solid patterns that are red, blue, or white having a crosshatch pattern that simply isn't visible on OnePlus's older smartphones. I completely agreed with OnePlus's choice of 1080p on their past smartphones, but saying that there's no benefit to going higher on a PenTile AMOLED display is simply false, and there's no getting around the fact that the OnePlus 3 has a lower effective resolution than its predecessors. \"\nThe OnePlus 5 uses a similar panel, albeit slightly improved in terms of calibration.", "time": "06-21-2017 09:55 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5859730", "text": "Exactly!", "time": "06-22-2017 02:02 PM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"postID": "post5858240", "text": "but don't they say that the QHD of the Galaxy S8 uses more battery than FHD, they give the option to lower the screen to save some battery, so... ?", "time": "06-21-2017 10:35 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5858243", "text": "Actually, no.\nYou only see battery savings by going all the way down to 720p.
