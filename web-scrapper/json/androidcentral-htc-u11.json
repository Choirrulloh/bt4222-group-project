Well, I just got off of the phone with Repair Service and they still do not have an answer on when I will get it back. Now, I asked them to just send it back to me and the guy said he can not do that. He even told me that it took him 4 months before he got his back from the repair shop. Are you kidding me. 1/3 of a year to get it back...really...for a screen repair. Now, the phone is great, but you would like good service with a buy and this is the worst. I will never get a phone made by this company again and I believe that the Pixel is made by them, so that is out of the question unless Google do not send it to them to repair a screen. Before I sent it, I checked for weeks to see if any company in the USA could fix it since I heard horrible stories about HTC service. No one could get the screen, so I did not have a choice.

I love when I call their number and get someone in the Phillipines (I think) who know absolutely not what they're doing and EACH AND EVERY TIME, I have to tell them my whole sad story from scratch, despite the previous rep saying they were updating everything in my file on the computer.\nI thought I had it all resolved when I got an email in late January saying that if I didn't pay the given estimate of $200, they would ship the phone back. I called them and advised that I had never received an estimate at any time since shipping them the phone, and was told that due to the confusion, they would offer me half off on the repair estimate. (if I had know then, what I know now, I would have just told them to ship me the phone back).\nGiddy with excitement at finally sorting it out, I gave them my CC number. I was then told that the 'office that processes the payment' was unavailable, but they would call me back in 3 days. A week later, I CALLED THEM BACK, and was told that they were still 'waiting for the 50% discount code' to apply to my estimate. WTF? Like searching the internet for a coupon code or something??!!\nA week later I called back again and ranted and demanded to speak to someone in the RMA department. I got someone named Lina, who advised me that the payment processing problem was almost sorted out and they would debit my card as soon as possible and 'I'll call you back in 3 days'. I asked if I would have to wait another 3 or 4 months once the payment was processed to actually have the screen repaired. She said 'No, we are just going to ship you a new phone, once the payment is processed.'\nThat was about 3 weeks ago. I never heard back from Lina. I have called the number on the website and also the number for HTC North America in Washington - this only gets you a receptionist who can apparently not transfer calls anywhere, but only take notes to pass on to the RMA department. I also emailed every email address I could find for any corporate management and the customer service email, including some woman that is the President or Chairwoman or something in Taiwan probably. No response. \nWhen I reach someone at the customer service #, they tell me that they are having 'phone problems' and can't reach the RMA department. What?? For a month. A tech company can't fix an internal phone network problem for over a month. Then, when I ask about paying the estimate, they tell me that 'the system that processes credit card payments is having technical problems'. Really...for over a month? Again...tech company can't fix this??!!!\nFinally, last week, just over four months in (so HTC has actually had my phone, longer than I've had my phone), and after several phone calls where I literally screamed on the phone, someone named Arby called me (from the Phillipines), saying she was my case manager (whatever happened to Lina and my NEW phone??? No one knows.) and they would be WAIVING the entire repair fee because of this complete failure of customer service. She said they had sent the information to the repair facility to waive the fee and go ahead and repair the phone. She would call me back with the tracking number once it was repaired and shipped back to me. So much for just shipping me a new phone, which (one would think) would be very easy to do, and not involve trying to process a credit card payment on their payment system that apparently has not been working for over a month.\nWell, obviously, based on the experience over the past four months, I'm not holding my breath waiting for this to happen. The phone hasn't even been repaired and God knows they probably don't have any glass in stock, if they even receive the information to waive the repair. Maybe they'll ship me a U12...bahahaha.\nI've owned an HTC Legend, a One M7, an M9 and this U11. Unfortunately, the U11 will be my last HTC. When I get it back it's going on kijiji or craigslist or ebay or whatever. I like HTC's hardware and their software, better than the Samsung phones I've owned, but this experience has soured me to the point of no return. It's no wonder HTC is losing market share and has become a bit player in the smartphone arena.\nI've moved on to the OnePlus 5t and liked it so much I got a second one for my wife to replace her Note 4. \nThanks for the miserable fail, HTC.

Ditched the iPhone, and never looked back. After many years, I finally needed a new phone, and, because of my previous experience, HTC was my first choice. I decided even though it was expensive, the new HTC U11 was probably worth it. So spent over $600 on a new phone. For 34 days, I marveled at how amazing it was. Stunning pictures, really fast, beautiful display, loved everything about it. \nThen it all went wrong. The home button and lock button stopped working. I dealt with it for a few days. tried restarting, backed up, restored, etc. eventually decided I should get it fixed. After all, this is a premium product from company I respected. Surely, they will stand behind their product and repair or replace it right away. After all, it\u2019s practically NEW! January 7th I called HTC to see what could be done. I was informed I had to send it to the repair center and it would \u201ctake up to 8 weeks to get it back\u201d. Woah, what the heck could take 8 weeks?!

And even going as far as factory setting my phone. Then I waited for the December security patch which was supposed to fix battery issues. Like people who had pixel 2 and other Google phones were having and Google release 8.1 with December 5th security update. but we did not get that we got half the fixes.

I was and and still kind of in the same situation. My HTC U11 had the touchscreen bug that would cause lag and random actions on the phone. So I contacted HTC about a repair and they said that it would take 20-25 business days because of a delay of parts. I was like ok that's fine, I'll deal with it. \nI created the ticket 10/10/2017 and sent the phone that same day. The phone arrived at the repair center on 10/16/2017. Weeks went by and I heard no updates on my phone. I would call and get nowhere. The support system has poor communication. The repair center can doesn't seem to update the ticket accurately and the support staff pretty much doesn't know anything besides what the consumer does. \nSo by the time my repair ticket status was updated, it said they received the phone 11/08/2017. Naturally this was not accurate as I sent it via USPS with signature and tracking so I know this was not accurate. So I called and called and got nowhere. I got frustrated and started looking around and found out some users with the same issues would contact Andre Lonne, the president of HTC America, via LinkedIn. I sent him a message explaining my situation and received a response from him saying he would forward the information to Lisa Ordell, the customer service manager.\nI received an email from Lisa saying that she would look to get this resolved. I did not hear back from her for a little less than a week. I then contacted Andre again and told him I did not hear back from her and that he would follow up with her. So this is where things start to move forward a bit.\nAfter a few days I called the customer support to check for an update and to just let them know how frustrating of an experience this has been. After getting off the phone with them, I received a call back from the RMA department at HTC offering a promo code for a brand new HTC U11 to make up for the problem that has been this repair process. I gladly accepted but of course the promo code did not work. I called back and they said that it was strange that it did not work and that they would get back to me in 24-48 hours; of course this turned into close to two weeks and still nothing.\nSo I just kept being persistent and letting them know this is not good customer service. At this point I was looking at possible legal action. An interesting note is I asked a representative how long HTC can legally hold a phone for repair and they replied with until the warranty ends which I thought was strange. Anyways over this week, I returned home from my girlfriend's place and I see this package in front of my door. I opened it to see a new HTC U11 sent from HTC. I was shocked because I was not made aware that I would be sent this. The tracking on the package says it was dropped off 12/20/2017. So it sat there for a day without my knowledge and luckily nobody came and took it. I'm just glad this whole ordeal was over with I will probably call this week though confirming that I received the package and to close the ticket.\nMy advice to OP is to reach out to Andre Lonne and go from there. Calling the corporate number hangs up on you so that doesn't help. Be persistent in contacting anyone at HTC and letting them know your situation and how unsatisfied you are with how it has been handled. If it gets to a point where nothing is working, look into filing a small claim.\nKeep up updated OP.

It\u2019s protected with Spigen Liquid Crystal case. One day, I had the phone sitting in cupholder of my car while I drove. I later pulled it out of my (front) pocket in the evening to discover crumbled glass on the side of the screen which quickly spidered out across the screen. The spot where the glass crumbled is exactly where my thumb sits when using the edge squeeze feature. The case covers this edge and does not have a scratch or a mark on it. I searched online for other people who may have experienced glass breakage. Seems to be growing concern over durability of the U11, see the test at\n\n. There are some complaints about breakage from just a small fall, but my phone was definitely not dropped!! I've never had a screen crack on any smartphones in the past and I'm pretty sure that it's a defect in manufacturing. Expect that we will be seeing more complaints over coming weeks and months. It appears that HTC has had issues with parts supply, particularly glass, so also expect long waits and expensive repairs. \nAfter hearing from HTC support that parts for the U11 were now available and repairs were running 7-10 days, I got an RMA and sent the phone back to them for repair on 7/17. I activated my older HTC One M8 in the meantime, which gives me no end of trouble with cellular radio signal and connectivity. I am barely able to make calls and rarely get data, while my wife's and daughter's iphones have no issues at our location.\nAttempting to use their online repair tracking tool, I checked daily to see if the device had advanced to status of \"shipped\" at their repair center. After several days there was no indication that it was received so I contacted them and asked directly. On 7/25, they requested that I provide a tracking number which I did, via both phone and their online messaging system (you can't email them directly, they communicate only through their ticketing system). I tracked the package via USPS and got proof that it had been delivered to their facilities on 7/20. They advised me \"not to worry\" as the repair tracking tool is frequently not updated. They assured me in a message that my case was escalated to their \"especial team project (SPT3)\". \nOn 8/2, now 13 days from their receipt of my phone, I messaged them to ask about status. Their reply, which is usually delayed by at least one day, came back on 8/3 as follows: \"Unfortunately, we still need to wait until the next, because we are experiencing a delay on our repair center\". For the next several days, we went back and forth with me trying to get an ETA for repair of my phone and HTC sending me vague messages telling me not to worry. I did begin to worry when I realized and told them that I was going abroad at end of the following week and needed a working phone. They still could not give me any status update or cause for delay, so I told them that I would need either my phone back or a replacement by end of week. Their response included: \"I would like to ask from you a bit more of your generous time to bring this event to the best results in your favor\".\nI tried calling HTC Support in hopes of better information. Typical hold times range from 15-20 minutes. They then asked me for tracking information all over again and I was on the phone with them for 56 minutes with no one able to provide any sort of update. I asked for a supervisor, who put me on hold for several minutes, and then assured me that someone from their repair team would call within 10 minutes. No call, so I sent another message via their ticketing system that I would have take my phone back without repair if they couldn't provide any status or ETA. This time, I got a fairly quick response saying that they will return my phone sometime in next 48 hours in its current (broken) state. They updated their ticketing system to reflect that I had closed the ticket.\nIn short, I'm ready to throw this phone out and go to Samsung or Apple, not because it's a bad device but because HTC is clearly struggling and can't keep up commitments, quality or service levels to remain competitive.", "time": "08-09-2017 08:56 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5918071", "text": "Please provide updates.

WTF??! No longer valid? You create a phone of glass and you discontinue the program? \nI asked the rep to provide me an estimate to get the phone fixed. He said that I would need to mail it out to Texas and that after they received that phone they would contact me with a price to fix the phone. I was upset that I couldn't get a reply regarding the repair cost. I then requested to speak to a supervisor. I spent an hour and a half waiting to speak to a supervisor because \"all supervisors are busy\". The rep kept suggesting to allow them to call me back but I refused. I requested for a clarification on the repair process which was confirmed by the HTC rep. \nThe entire repair time could last a month before you even see your phone again. \n1. you request for a RMA. (the RMA is only valid for 14 days. If they do not receive your phone the RMA in not valid and they will send your phone back to you.\n2. you send your phone to Texas. Depending where you live it can take 3-4 days. \n3. Once they receive your phone they have to process/log the receipt and diagnose the issue with phone. 2 days not counting weekends. \n4. Once they diagnose your phone they will send you an email with the cost to fix your phone. (I called screen fix-it shops and they said that the cost would be about $200.) 2 day turn around depending on how fast you reply to the email. \n5. Then they will ship your phone back slow route.

Don't forget to account \"anything can happen\" time. \nIn the end before I hung up with HTC I did receive an RMA for the phone, but have decided not to send it in. \nI called around to see if anyone could fix it. All the fix-it shops told me the same thing, \"They do not have the screens yet\". Because the phone is new to the market, they have yet to provide screens to the aftermarket repair shoppes. The cost will still be the same $200'ish. \nJust like the rest of you I am also very upset at HTC customer service. I even twitted about it. HTC seem to care less what their customers experience.

I've noticed that with quite a few shots I've taken with the U11 that it had a tendency to back-focus. \nFor example I took a picture of a young boy in a garden where he was center frame, yet the camera focused on the flowers behind him. It did this twice in a row and the only way to remedy this is that I had to manual set the focal point to his face to prevent it from back-focusing. Again in a night club and taking a group photo in low light, it back-focused and the only way to mitigate that issue was to manually set the focal point to the group of people. So it seems that when shooting in auto-mode and NOT manually setting the focal point, the U11 doesn't do a consistent job of picking the correct subject to focus on.\nMy second petty gripe is with the focal length. Though I know this is fixed, I'd prefer they chose 35mm instead of going wide with 28mm (I think). When trying to frame shots of people, the distortion drives me insane, especially when doing full-body shots in portrait orientation. I know it's the nature of having a wide-angle focal length, but it seems it favors landscape, group photos, and architecture type shots. In my opinion 35mm would have been more flexible.\nMake no mistake though, the quality of the images it creates are still stunning to me regardless.

The U11 costs $900 CAD, and is still expensive in the States. However, it's not nearly as expensive as other flagships; and it *is* a flagship, so I can sort of understand its price point.

I thought I'd post the test results of the U11 USB C adapter. These tests compare the audio quality of the powered DAC in the HTC adapter to other phones with a built in headphone jack.\nI was expecting the U11 DAC built into the adapter to be \"adequate\", and I was really surprised that it held up very well in listening tests. I like to perform such tests because sometimes what's on paper and does not match up with how the human perceives good sound, but I'm happy to report the U11 adapter sound is in line with the test numbers. Of the phone specifications I have on file, the HTC M8 is still on top for analog audio. No surprise there, but with the U11 coming in close to the M8 and above the V20, and every other 2017 smartphone, some people will probably be saying \"Whaaat?\" The V20 and V30 party trick is running high impedance headphones. Basically they can drive less sensitive headphones that require higher voltages. The differences in sound quality between high impedance headphones and very good normal impedance headphones is subtle, but it's a moot point for U11 owners because USonic sounds better than both \nAnyway, below are the test results after the firmware update.\nSome of you are familiar with the specifications terminology, but I'll include the spec name and description because I abbreviated it due to neatness.\nNoise: This is the residual noise measured at the output jack with no music playing. Lower number is better, but remember that it's a negative number! -90 is better than -80.\nDR: Dynamic Range is the maximum difference between the quietest and loudest sounds a device can output. Higher numbers are better.\nTHD: Total harmonic distortion is varaitions in the accuracy of waveforms output, and is represented in percent. For example, a THD rating of 0.0012 means the waveform output is 99.9988% accurate, and there is a 0.0012% variation from the original waveform. Lower numbers are better.\nIMD+: Referrs to Intermodulation distortion plus noise. This type of distortion creates unwanted frequencies and is more noticable than harmonc distortion. It is represented in percent and lower numbers are better.\nCrosstalk: (almost there!) Stereo crosstalk is the amount of electrical leakage from one stereo channel to another. For example, if you play something that is only on the left channel, the crosstalk is a measurement of how much audio signal leaks to the right channel. Lower numbers are better, but agan they are negative, so -90 is better than -80.\nDevice / Noise / DR / THD / IMD+ / Crosstalk\nHTC One (M8) / -95.4 / 93.4 / 0.0012 / 0.0100 / -93.2\nHTC U11 / -94.1 / 94.1\t0.0017 / 0.0067 / -94.5\nLG G6 / -93.3 / 93.3 / 0.0059 / 0.0095 / -94.4\nLG V20 -93.0 / 93.1 / 0.0036 / 0.0075 / -93.7\nHTC 10 -93.2 / 93.2 / 0.0022 / 0.0710 / -92.8\nGalaxy S8 / -92.5 / 92.5 / 0.0016 / 0.0072 / -92.8\nXperia XZ Prem / -90.6 / 90.4 / 0.0180 / 0.0270 / -92.6\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask!", "time": "09-07-2017 02:18 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5962400", "text": "Apologies for the data table not keeping format.

First, my thoughts on the headphones themselves:\n1. Marshall Master: Got a pair at Costco for $50. Sound is incredible for that kind of money, but they're incredibly uncomfortable. The cups ride over my ear lobes, not around them, and it's too tight for that kind of design. I can't wear them for more than 30 minutes before my ears start aching. They'll probably go back to Costco at some point.\n2. Status Audio CB-1: I bought these on sale for $63 from Amazon because I'd read reviews that said they're as good as the A-T ATH-M50x for around half the price. I can't agree. Yes, they're not bad, with relatively flat performance that's boosted just a bit at the low end. But they're way too sparkly at the top end of the register -- anything with tons of cymbals hurts my head.\n3. Audio-Technica ATH-M50x: I've been short on cash and these things have been calling my name for awhile now. I decided to pull the trigger after using the CB-1's, to specifically compare those two. And to my ears, there's no comparison. The M50x provides tremendous amounts of detail, they're mostly flat but still have some personality, and lows, mids, and highs all sound equally good. I love all the brass in Chicago's music, for example, and that stuff is pure heaven on the M50x.\nNow for the U11: I'm not an audiophile (never had the money for it), but if that's not a great sound signature, then I give up. Pairing the U11 with the M50x provides for a simply awesome experience. There's plenty of volume for me (I go to about 75% and it's just on the edge of being too loud), and the U11 seems to pull out the right details without being too bright. \nThe Marshall Master sounds warmer with the U11 compared to, say, the iPhone 6. Not too warm, just different. But I don't prefer warm over bright within certain limits. Not sure if I'm using all of the right terminology here, so I'm just describing how it sounds to me personally. But the U11 paired with the M50x is the best smartphone audio experience I've been able to muster -- and the $150 for the M50x, though outside of my budget at the moment, was more than worth giving up some lattes and hamburgers.\nI have no idea if any other phones, like the LG V20 or V30 or earlier HTCs, provide a better experience, and honestly I don't care. The U11 with the USonic headphones is fine for when I'm away from the home/office or moving around, and then the M50x is a great experience for when I'm really wanting to listen and concentrate on some great music.", "time": "09-10-2017 12:07 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5969286", "text": "I agree.

Started about a week ago. So far I've been able to eliminate the USB cable by swapping it out and replicating the results with another cable.\nThis started about a week ago (I've had the phone for about 3 months now)\nWhat happens is, when I use the original HTC charger with my phone, I get the attached message and really slow charging and Ampere reports that it draws around 60mA. If I plug my girlfriend's Galaxy S7 charger using the same USB cable, it draws around 1000-1200mA, reports Quick Charger connected and charges quickly. If I then go back to using my charger, I get the Quick Charger results. If I disconnect my phone and wait a few hours, it'll go back to slow charging when I use my charger. My girlfriend's Samsung Galaxy S7 gets Quick Charging regardless of what charger she uses.\nIn summary, this is what I get from my testing:\nOriginal HTC Charger with U11 - Slow charging (most of the time)\nSwapping from HTC Charger to Samsung charger and then back to HTC charger - Quick Charging (most of the time)\nSamsung charger with U11 - Always quick charging\nHTC charger with Galaxy S7 - Always quick charging\nAll other USB functions (Audio, Boom sound, data transfer) work fine.\nAs you can see at the moment it's impossible for me to eliminate either the phone or charger to be at fault. And it's doing my head in.\nI've also tried a factory reset, and have tried fully discharging and recharging the battery. I cannot for the life of me work out what the issue is.\nAnyone come across anything similar, can anyone shed any light on this one?", "time": "09-03-2017 09:10 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5957473", "text": "I usually find its poor connection on one end or the other when I get that notice...", "time": "09-05-2017 11:51 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5958159", "text": "I'm sorry you are experiencing this issue, OP!

As the battery is close to its normal life, I am thinking of upgrading to U11. Here are some of the areas where I had some issues with M7. Dear U11 users, can you please help see if you still have the following issues?\n1) auto screen brightness. \nThis function doesn't really do it well to my eyes. I usually use 1bar for indoor day time and no bar for night time or where there is not so much light. The auto screen brightness at night time seems too bright to me. This is, however, really a personal experience. I put there just to see if any of you have the same feeling for U11\n2) camera\nSince the beginning, the M7 camera gave me purple pictures when the light is dim. Later on\nI found one the internet this means something is wrong. I didn't know this until recently. I had thought it was like this. Does U11 still have this purple image?\n3) volume control\nI had always wanted the minimum volume level right above mute can be less loud just a bit. Right now the minimum volume level still sounds a little loud to me.\n4) slow apps under wifi\nThis may be very specific. I am a WeChat user and have found when using wifi, the page loading is very slow compared with 4G LTE. Not sure it is a phone issue or the issue with the particular app\n5) curved back\nI have used my palm to hold the cellphone, instead, I use my fingers. So the curved back is not necessary for me. I'd like to have a flat back so when I lay the phone on the desk and type, it doesn't rock.

The camera is phenomenal, the battery life is exceptional, the dual speakers are are louder and more full as compared to previous HTC (M8 was close), edge sense is surprisingly useful and the screen is the first HTC screen I've had no trouble with in direct sunlight.\nIt does have apple airplay native support. The speaker comparisons I've found say that the OnePlus single speaker is plenty loud when compared to the rest of the flagships out there. As far as better sound, I believe the 11 would be better.

I put it down on a counter and it literally walks off and slid down on to the carpet. I laid it on my lap and it slides right off. Ridiculously slippery. I'm going to spray the clear cover with a clear non-slip coating I have in a spray can, hopefully that will let me hang on to the thing.\nAlso noticed that the cell phone connectivity is about half of what my Moto X Pure Edition is. I get like 2 bars in places where I had 4 before. Also, it stutters on WiFi connectivity, about half the time it stops and tells me WiFi isn't connected when it is.\nI got rid of the dumb \"Highlights\" thing also and replaced it with Google Now launcher. Also, none of the app icons or the clock would line up on the home screen until I replaced it with the Google Now launcher.\nBTW, the U11 looks and feels nearly identical to the Moto X P.E. I was shocked when I pulled the U11 out of the box and felt it, it is identical to the Moto X but maybe 1 mm thinner. And a lot more slippery...\nSo far, not really impressed, to be honest. I expected better. Sorry guys!\nUPDATE: I now decided to give this one to my wife, who needs a replacement for her old LG Flex. I'm not pleased with the U11 at all, I absolutely hate the dialer, which uses 2/3 of the screen for the number pad and then you have to swipe down to see the contacts. \nApparently, you can not set it to open to the favorite contacts every time AND the worst thing is that you can't move around your favorite contacts, it lists them by alphabetical order only and that's it?! \nAlso on the dialer, I sometimes need to copy/paste the last number called to check if its spam, so I can block it with Blacklist Pro. The HTC only lets you copy the full number without hyphens, so I then have to manually add the hyphens.\nAlso, I really, really miss my instant notifications that I had on the Moto X, which shows the latest emails, texts, etc. with a touch on the home screen. The home screen on the U11 looks positively cheesy in comparison.\nAnd finally, there's no photo album? Only Google photos, which I hate.\nOverall, very disappointed in the U11, it seems like a generation old compared to my 2 year old Moto X Pure Edition. I was mad at Motorola for not updating with Nougat, but to be honest, I don't notice any difference anyway on the U11. So I guess I've now realized I'm a die-hard Motorola guy.

In a nutshell, it's a really good phone that does almost all of the basics really well, in a design that is very Unique and attractive. It's perhaps a step above the HTC 10 in the sense that HTC 10 was an all round good phone, but it just okay across the board.\nDesign wise i have to say i still like the HTC 10 better, but not that the U11 is bad looking. It's a big phone with big bezels, but when looking at the broader picture (at least till this point in time), it's still the norm. Tall displays are more of an outlier still. Maybe that'll change at the end of the year. \nThe squeeze function isn't really something I like using that much because the phone is quite big, the frame is a bit thin and rounded. It always feels like I don't have as good a grip on the phone while squeezing. It can be useful for some things, but it's quite a forgettable feature.\nPerformance wise it's really good too, where I live we get the 128gb/6GB RAM version. It's smooth and super fast for the most part, but I wouldn't say the fastest phone I've used. I noticed that at times it clears out the RAM for some of the apps that I've recently used seemingly at random. Not sure if it's just it being too aggressive at cleaning or what. but not a big deal.\nCamera is probably one of the highlights of the phone, and it produces all round pleasing looking shots in both good and low light. But I wouldn't pick this as my favourite camera experience though. In lowlight, the metering favours higher exposure, which results in clipped highlights in shots with artificial lighting. I live in a city with street lights everywhere, so it can be a bit annoying manually tweaking the exposure a bit lower for almost every shot.\nBattery life is also surprisingly decent for a 3,000mAh battery. Gets me through a day of normal use just fine, though not much more. But definitely better than the U Ultra and the HTC 10 with the same capacity.\nOverall, It's just a good smartphone. Nothing really groundbreaking or amazing worth noting, but it does what a basic smartphone should really well. Checks most of the boxes for me anyway. I don't really mind not having 3.5mm audio jack since i use bluetooth earbuds primarily, but this will probably turn some people off.\nIt's been a good year so far. Good phones from Samsung, LG, Sony, and even HTC. Just hope that HTC can keep this up.

Yeah, every phone has their own pros and cons, and frankly a lot of it might be just down to personal preference. Some people might like bezels for better grip, some people will hate curves screens, some people need a headphone jack, etc. So it's all subjective. But it's been a great year so far, with good showing for a lot of the major OEMs. Which results in great choices for consumers to choose from.\nDeep down i'm a bit of a Motorola fan despite having been disappointed one too many times, but really looking forward to what they have to offer next too, in particularly the Moto X4.\nAnyway, i think this is probably one of the best HTC phone (except for the design imo). I have had all of the flagship phones in recent years. The One XL, One M7, M8, M9, 10, and U Ultra, and the U11 is probably the most complete package yet (again, 3.5mm not a big deal for me personally).

I had a long day last Sunday 9am to 1am that was also very hot, with a ton of usage including the camera, and I still had about 30% left. And it uses next to no battery when it is idle. Camera has been pretty superb, although I still find myself occasionally needing to switch to Pro mode and tweaking shutter speed and ISO under certain conditions but it has been much easier to set it to attain a good result.

You've seen the reviews, and read this thread. I generally agree with all of them. Here's my 'brain dump' coming from a OnePlus 3T (before that, S7, S6 active, OnePlus One, MotoX 2013, and a bunch of iPhones)One reason I didn't get OP5, Camera. The U11 camera can capture my kids without bluring in most cases. The 3T on auto defaulted to 1/17 shutter and everyone was constantly blurred. Other photos are much clearer and without as much 'processing' when zoomed. Overall the U11 totally 'delights' me as far as camera.Phone is FAST and smooth. I never had issues with the 3T, so I was a little scared that the U11 may have studders. It doesn't. Really, my experience with Samsung scared me when getting a 'skinned' phone.Battery: I have setup my U11 exactly the same as my 3T as far as launcher, apps, and configurations. I am easily getting 6hrs SOT. Bluetooth on all the time, same locations with the 3T, no tweaks or anything. My 3T was was doing about 4hrs SOT, still brought me through the day with some to spare, but I think the SD835 has some real gains to be realized.I wear polarized sunglasses, so landscape outdoors sucks.I mostly used Bluetooth for headphones and audio, so no 3.5mm jack was fine. However, the supplied headphones are REALLY good. I'm a casual listener, but wow, even I could hear a big difference compared to what I was used to on my crappy BT headphones and standard wired earbuds.Screen is good overall. I never minded the 1080p on the 3T. I can't really tell much of a difference with 1440p. Screen is bright and clear. Actually, the 3T always defaulted to a very dim 'auto' mode. HTC defaults to a much brighter auto. Battery is still great so I actually prefer the brighter setting.I don't like that the volume and power buttons are all on the same side. Just my personal preference, I keep turning off the screen when I want to Vol-HTC apps like dialer, clock etc look really dated. Samsung and OnePlus were much more pleasing. I switched to Nova Prime day one so I could configure Icons, launcher, guestures. Using 3rd party apps makes the user experience much better. (I did the exact same on my S7 and OP3T). I never cared for default launchers. I did like some of the customizations on OnePlus and loved the dev community behind the OPO and OP3T. So I am looking forward to what happens with the U11. There's a lot to love with the software and the future of dev with the U11, I'm looking forward to future improvements from HTC or other devs.I'm vain, but I love that I could change the system font without rooting/ROMing/or much trouble.Love that I don't get a warning message for high volume.Fingerprint scanner is the fastest and most accurate compared to the S7 and 3T. The U11 hasn't misread my finger once. On my 3T, it was like 1 out of 10 scans would give me an error (maybe I needed to recalibrate, too late, I've moved on)Speakers are improved over my past phones, not but tons, but to my untrained ears, it was slightly better/louder. To me the 'Theater Mode' was better sounding than the other mode.Nice to have waterproofing again. I took the S6 Active underwater a bunch, but after a close call with the phone not charging, I didn't dare do the same the the S7. But it is nice to know that the U11 can handle a spill/drop in the water.I'll miss you Dash Charging. It was FAST, but the U11 is no slouch either. There are more QC3.0 accessories (battery packs/chargers, etc), so it helps ease the pain of losing Dash.Design is nice and solid, no complaints. I had to put a case on it because it was so slippery. I like to keep my phones pristine for resale (I love to switch phones). The included case isn't great. I got a $8 Amazon case that does the job.Phone is ever so slightly larger than the 3T, plus I need a case since it is so slippery.Radios, BT, Wifi has been solid for me. I'm on AT&T service. No networking drops/hiccups/disconnections. \nOverall, the U11 is an upgrade all around, I'm very happy with it. Hope HTC gets back on its feet and builds a bigger user base with the U11.

[{"title": "Sadly, I am returning my U11 to HTC", "thread": [{"postID": "post5864714", "text": "This is a 7.30.2017 update to the original post, below. Unfortunately, this thread seems to have morphed into complaints about refunds and questioning HTC, generally. My comments about the design/engineering decisions made by HTC were just that. In my 7 years of using only HTC phones, I have found their tech support prompt and excellent, the phones highly reliable and a pleasure to use - except for the issues with batteries that decline too much after the first year and are not easily replaced because they are cemented to the case back, underneath the motherboard. HTC is a fine company that makes great products. They just need the design/engineering folks to get out more and see what happens in the real world. FWIW, FedEx delivered my U11 on June 17 and my CC was refunded by DRI-HTC on June 21. I find it strange that several folks on this thread have had difficulties obtaining refunds. The LG G6 continues to be a decent replacement - interesting to use a non-HTC phone after 7 years - but I cannot say that I love it. I may break with my two-years-or-bust tradition and get the Pixel 2 (made by HTC) when it comes out this Fall. Original post follows:\n***************************************\nFor the past six years, I have enjoyed my HTC phones immensely (Incredible/DNA/M9) and have been looking for their new flagship for many months. The build quality, features and performance have been great, although a couple of design issues have always lingered: gluing the battery to the case back, under the motherboard would be fine except that the DNA/M9 batteries were both on life support after two years and I have always had issues with their emphasis on sound - it is a phone/PDA and if I want great stereo I use earphones. Seriously, how many people ever had a movie night on their cell phone? For the M9, it just meant that the phone was taller - space that could have been occupied by a battery or a design permitting its easy replacement. Which brings me to the U11. It is fast and I love the fingerprint reader that I have envied on iPhones. My aging laptop and the new TSA Global Entry devices have issues with my barely-there prints, but this works fast and flawlessly. So why not keep it? Let me count the ways:It is too big. There are Plus sizes and regular sizes and this is in-between.It is slippery, really slippery. I put the phone face down on a pad of yellow paper. The side of the pad was raised less than .25 inches by a mouse pad and i watched in amazement as it slowly crawled off the paper. Oleophobic has become papyryphobic. Of course with a case, that shoud be fine.The Amazing Silver is just not my color. I called and went to Sprint a few times to find out when the demo days would be; nobody knew. I found one on the HTC site and went then - the store did not know until the rep arrived that she would be there. She brought only the Blue phone, and knew little about it - it was a 3rd party demo contractor. I returned to the store a few days after Sprint began selling the U11, just to see the Black phone. They didn't have any. HTC: this was a very poor rollout. Admittedly, I like the Apple Silver and the HTC Gunmetal Gray, but I just don't understand why HTC spent a fortune developing the back side of the device and making it so garish. It's a phone|PDA, not a Chihuly exhibit.The dual SIM/SD tray is two disasters waiting to happen. If you change SIMS while travelling, it is going to get bent because it is no longer a tray, but a frame that makes insertion a hassle. If it had to be a dual tray, make it sideways, like the LG G6, which inserts more easily without the SD Card trying to pop up. And it won't be long before somebody puts a paperclip through the top speaker by mistake. That tray should be on the side.The flip clock font got ugly when it was stretched to fill the 5X2 widget grid. Having had an actual flip clock long ago, I fell in love with it and have used that excellent widget for 4 + years. Perhaps a different launcher would solve the problem, but I have already invested days in this phone, with increasing disappointment.The Favorites widget has disappeared, again. I have had it next to my Home screen for 4 years - you get nice, large tiles with a picture and can select the default action for each recipient. Very convenient. HTC discontinued it in a 9.6.2016 update and I was able to recover it for the M9 but, like the Monty Python parrot, it is no more.It doesn't really work on Verizon - see thread \"Verizon certified my arse.\" It did not work at all with my VZW SIM card. HTC updated the firmware to xxx.4 to address connectivity and solved that issue, but not the many others. I spent 2.5 hours with VZW trying to recover my VZW Cloud backup data, to no avail. After the xxx.4 update, I spent another 45 minutes, got a trouble ticket opened and still no joy there. This is largely a VZW issue; they are very proprietary. I have used SIM cards in my DNA and M9 without difficulty in many countries, but coming home I had to get a new SIM card for the DNA (the old one would not re-provision itself on VZW). This cannot be unknown to HTC, so my take is that they made a design decision to punt VZW customers.It plays music when cold-started, letting everybody within earshot know that I have turned on my HTC phone! The DNA started that absurd feature; when turned on, in a very loud and obnoxious voice, it screamed \"Droidddd!\" It was a major turnoff that could not be turned off. I found myself trying to smother the DNA when turning it on in public, so I was delighted to find that the M9 started up silently. The U11 plays three notes when started, then plays them again after the lock screen. Why? I called HTC a couple of times to see if they had enough complaints to stop the music, but no.HTC redesigned the keyboard, apparently for the sake of redesigning the keyboard. The M9 was a big improivement over the DNA, but the U11 changes make no sense to me. I wear reading glasses and, after learning the long-press characters on the M9, HTC just mixed them all up for fun.\nLast week a friend got an LG G6. It is the kind of design that I like in a phone, the clean, functional, elegant lines of a device that we all use constantly. It is the design used in the HTC One series and in the iPhone and in many of the newer competitors' phones. Why muck up a personal device by making it an artwork? It is a phone/PDA. I use it for everything, every day, many times per day. I don't admire its backside. \nReports say that the included earbuds are great when programmed to the ear - probably a revolution started by HTC -and the Edge Sense functions are nifty. I never got that far. After spending many hours trying to see the phone and a coupd of long days trying to get it set up, only to find that it and VZW would never play nicely together, i gave up when I saw the G6 and was instantly struck by the realization that this is what I hoped the U11 would be.\nI wish HTC all the best. They have done many wonderful things and they still build great devices. But they need to get out of the art business and out of the theater sound business and get back to the phone business. I hope they do that in the next two years because I would love to return.

I'm supposed to be cleaning my boat and truck today, but I don't wanna.\nI get that some people with the U11 on Verizon are upset. Rightly so. Some people aren't so I guess it depends on where you live and what LTE band you have access to. If HD Voice is already active on your line of service then some of the issues aren't applicable. But the Band 13 thing is a problem for lots of people. I don't know if HTC and Verizon had some working agreement in place only to realize that they weren't on the same page; or some terms of said agreement were altered along the way; or there was only a hope and a prayer involved on HTC's part. I'm hoping we all find out eventually.\nIn my earlier post I wasn't trying to dismiss anyone's issues. I was trying to get to the heart of the matter: Verizon is screwing people over who want a phone that is 100% capable of operating on their network! Qualcomm doesn't make a Verizon-specific Snapdragon processor. There aren't Verizon-only modems that manufacturers solder to circuit boards on special to phones that Verizon allows on their network. If that were the case, flagship phones would cost $3000. It's the carrier-specific software that enables some of this stuff. The U11 has every radio in it that you need to run on any network here. This includes the CDMA and GSM radios. The Snapragon 835 is a robust SoC, but it's more than just the one chip nowadays. They're responsible for the whole physical network ecosystem inside your device. Every LTE band is supported on this device. Here are the bands the device supports that work in the US: 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,12,13,20,25,26,28,41, and 66. It also has full support for 2 and 3-channel carrier aggregation here, as well as VoLTE and WiFi calling. It supports 4X4 MIMO too! I'm pretty sure that several of those bands are Verizon network bands.\nSo a few things here: when you see the device on HTC's site, they show you what bands are going to work on your network (except Verizon) by only showing the bands that network accesses. They could do a much better job of explaining this, as some people think they are getting branded devices. There really is only one device built by HTC. There are different software versions that make for different SKUs when you order a specific color, but that is it (unless the Sprint version has carrier branding printed on the back. I don't remember it having that when I went to a Sprint store to grope one. If it does, though, then there would technically be a different device built, though it would only be different at the end when they put a different back on it w/ Sprint's logo.). I'm sure that saves a ton of money on production costs, which HTC desperately needs. They only show features that will work with a network (i.e. VoLTE, etc.) when it doesn't require special access. This is why there is no VoLTE or WiFi calling on AT&T, but everything works on T-Mobile because they (like the honeybadger) don't give a $&!@. The MIMO capabilities (like CDMA) are only unlocked with the ROM on the Sprint devices. Maybe at some point they will unlock it on the unlocked version (is that a pun? I'm not sure) so T-Mobile users will get MIMO benefits as well. Maybe that was one of Sprint's requirements in order partner w/ HTC for this device. The plain and simple truth about Verizon is that the U11 works on Band 13 because Verizon can't stop it. Devices that utilize GSM radios can't be blocked by a network operator and neither can Band 13 (though there are a few technical exceptions to those rules), or anything in the 700MHz C block. Here's the rule about the 700MHz C block specifically :Licensees offering service on spectrum subject to this section shall not deny, limit, or restrict the ability of their customers to use the devices and applications of their choice on the licensee's C Block network...\nSo that's that. The bare minimum that Verizon has to allow BY LAW is what they allow. That is their choice. This device has no issues with other bands or other features. Whether HTC jumped the gun saying the device would work all over Verizon's LTE bands or Verizon decided later on to lock the other bands down, who knows? I've seen various message boards where it looks like it was working on other bands for people for the first couple of days and then nothing. It seems a new SIM, activated on their line in a different phone then swapped it into their U11, got it working right, but now only on Band 13. I am a huge nerd and a geek and a dork. Lots of us are here. In the beginning of this site, and most others like it, nerds ruled the roost. The forums were filled w/ techno-babble that most of us understood and we would switch between here and XDA, PPCGeeks, Phandroid, Android Police and others and we just understood what most of this stuff was and what it meant. Lots of people had the same usernames and avatars at multiple sites, making it feel very communal.

My mistake. I was referencing the objectivity vs subjectivity vein that the thread has been focused on. I realize you focused on the subjective, what's best for the user in the moment criteria. My point was that the presence of subjective criteria does not eliminate the presence of objective criteria. \nAs an example, one could say that chocolate ice cream has either more or less calories than vanilla ice cream, whichever is true. That statement can be verified by actually measuring the calorie content of the same quantity of each kind. So this would be an objective statement that can be checked and verified using measurement, aka math to determine which is actually greater. At the same time, you could say that one tastes better than the other, and since that is based on your perceptions and opinions, that would be subjective. \nSo while we do have the ability to say that one camera is able to be measured to out perform another in testing scenarios, aka it is objectively superior - that doesn't necessarily mean that it is the best one for every individual, because which one is best for an individual is a subjective claim based on their own perceptions and opinions. It also follows that no matter who, or even how many, prefer one over another, the measurements and associated rankings themselves are free of influence from those subjective criteria and do not change simply because of user preferences. \nTLDR, there is an objective ranking to these cameras that can be measured and verified and there are subjective opinions about these cameras, that cannot be measured and verified, because they are simply opinions.

I didn't have to pay off my v20 but did anyway and will keep it as a emergency device with all the spare batteries and cases I have for it. \nI have been setting everything up including the headphones and can say that they sound very good and their eq does a excellent job on smoothing things out nicely and they have a good amount of very punchy low end which surprised me completely. \nThe speed of the wifi and the cell signal is phenomenal as well as how the overall feel of the phone and responds... Blazing fast is a appropriate description. \nWiFi calling... Damn Sprint hit it on the nose with this one and I never knew what or how good it was till now. It's always been a hit or miss and wasn't something I wanted to use, but I will actually be using this feature now. \nI was having some serious problems with wifi disconnects and cell service not to mention speaker distortion. Others have had the same problems so it is what it is for those. Hopefully LG will get a fix in for the v20 like they did for the G6. \nI got the blue version of this phone and it certainly is blue... Lol. \nIt's also slicker than snot and I put it in the drop protecting Incipeo case at the store. Most folks know that I am not a fan of any glass backed phone, so I won't try to be trendy and use it naked \ud83d\ude01\nWhat else.... Oh yeah... That dongle thingy works good with wired headphones and sounds damn good too... I don't know what some of these reviewers are talking about, but with my Sony's they sound every bit as good as my v20 sounded. They may not sound as bright as on the v20 but I was using power amp and had everything set but, out of the box just using Google Music they certainly sound just as good with clear seperation and depth of field and the low end isn't muddy or congested but very detailed and punchy after a few hours of detailed comparisons. Tidal I have subscribed to (6) months free from Sprint... So we'll have to wait until I get busy with this for more details.. \nOK... My major gripes are as follows and these are my personal thoughts and opinions, nothing more... \nNo Ota radio... I will have to just get over it and learn to stream.. Period. \nSealed battery... See above \nGlass backs... See above... \nIt's smaller than my v20... Hmm... I will get used to it fairly quickly. \nThe screen is nicer than the LG and fwiw HTC has better themes and easier to download. \nBoom Sound... Much Much better than the LG v20, not as good as my m8, but nice loud and clear, same with the speaker phone. \nCall quality is excellent BTW and battery life is certainly better...

The fact is, I have several different sets of headphones, so will I need an adapter for each? What will these new adapters cost? That is an added expense that I didn't have before. And you are making an assumption that the adapter available on HTC.com is the same one that will be released with the U11. I doubt very much that it is, and expect that the new adapter to cost upwards of $25 each. The DAC isn't free.\nThen there is a question of signal amplification. Does this new set up drive the same impedance headphones that my 10 does? Will I now need to buy an external amp to run my high-end cans? \nThe new adapter with the DAC draws power from the device, so you can't leave it plugged in while not in use. That wasn't the case for leaving headphones plugged in. On that same thought, what will the impact be on battery life? Negligible? Significant? \nIf BT was the future of how audio is to develop, how come the U11 doesn't use 5.0? How come it doesn't support AptX HD? What if I don't already own BT headphones? I don't. So another added expense. And those have to be charged, and over time, the battery degrades, so, there is that.\nIf audio over USB-C is the future, how come the audio industry doesn't offer a deluge of USB-C alternatives. Especially on the higher end? Because they would have to make one version for Lightning and one for USB-C. And the onus would be on the manufacturer to install and tune the DAC in their headphones. Variation may be SIGNIFICANT from manufacturer to manufacturer, moreso than just headphone quality.\nWhat about people who own cars without BT connections. Buy an additional adapter or a BT rig for the car. Added Expense there. And if the car does have BT, is it AptX? AptX HD? What about signal interference? And what happens when it just doesn't work. I know this isn't obvious, but auto manufacturers are WAY behind the tech curve. I wouldn't be surprised if most cars are only BT2.1 ADP. And then there is the issue of cars having a much longer life span than phones, so as technology marches on, we are stuck with phones that don't even work with our cars in 5 years. What happens when they abandon BT for a new tech? Progress. \nThe question was raised in a post above, what is the BENEFIT of removing the port? Thinner device? We are at a point of ridiculously thin devices now. Not to mention, many phones are housed in bulky cases these days. Larger Battery? That isn't the case here. A larger screen on a smaller device? Not the case here. Simplified design? I don't see that here. Water proofing? Not according to Samsung, who still offers the Aux Port. Cost? Laughable. So some of us have to give up a convenience and potentially increase a cost for what benefit? I didn't think it made sense when Apple did it, and I don't think it makes sense now.\nAnd to argue that headphones with active noise cancellation somehow improve audio, that is simply not the case. The audio signal is significantly processed and much detail can be lost in sloppy applications. It may improve the experience (especially on flights, where Bose NC headphones are extremely common) and remove noise, but it doesn't actually improve the audio.\nThese are the reasons it annoys me, and I find it to be an inconvenience. In the end, we will all have to face the extinction of the Aux port, but I am invested in it and I am not quite ready to go there yet. For folks like me, this will be an unwanted loss for no perceived or actual gain. \nI hope this answers your questions.

You have attacked Samsung without comparing them to any other phone -- that is because if you compare them to other phones, you would come to the same conclusion I have. LG phones are unreliable with cold display temperatures and a bad UI. Pixel phones lack features, have outdated designs, and are just so-so in many areas. HTC phones lack features and the only somewhat competitive phone they have is the U11. Sony has outdated designs and lacks features. Motorola stopped really trying. So on and so forth. Samsung phones are reliable. Samsung audio is fine. \n- Your Blu-ray vs streamed 4K analogy fails. A Galaxy S8/S8+ recording in 4K has 4 times the resolution of a U11 recording in 1080p AND almost 2.5 times the bitrate. You keep insisting that 1080p records at a higher bitrate than 4K and it doesn't. A 4K video can play natively on a 4K display. A 1080p video cannot. \n- Of course a 1080p recording will take less battery, less space, and require less image processing than 4K. You're recording a lower quality video. Record in 720p for even more savings. \n- 4K prices didn't come down due to content.

I'll take them in order. #1 Since I actually own one and they don't, I believe that I am in a better position to critique the phone more accurately than they can. Also we will deal with a out and out falsehood that was made. \nThe u11 has the best LCD screen out right now. It's colors are more accurate than any other phone that I have owned or did a direct in hand comparison to. It is more pleasing to the eye, straight out of the box than any Samsung amoled screen. It isn't glaring or gaudy and does not need to be tweaked to look accurate. While amoled may be the preferred screen of you and others, I have found that a LCD screen like the u11 to be better on a mobile device than amoled screens due to eye fatigue and also for screen burn in. \nThe battery life on this phone isn't good.. It's great. I have been averaging over 6 hours of SOT with everything syncing, and not in any battery saving mode. No Samsung with the same size battery can match this. There is no Samsung phone that is better than the u11 for software performance. This phone is fluid and stands well above anything TouchWiz offers... and will do so 6 months down the line when TouchWiz is studdering. \nNow let's talk about audio... the audio of the u11 tromps anything that Samsung offers including rooting the Samsung and loading Viper. It's onpar with my v10 and v20. Yes there are some differences, and yes it doesn't have a 3.5mm headphone jack but I think that the majority of people will never notice and you will need to put them on a scope to actually see any real differences. I love the sound from both. Having the uSonics map my ears and then adjusting the sound to them produces a near perfect blend of highs mids and lows. Clarity is excellent and the low end is punchy. The sound stage is expansive and enveloping. With the new software update for the dongle with the amp and Dacs it does not struggle with my high impedance reference Sony cans. Listening to any Samsung is equivalent to listening to 2 tin cans and a string... There is no comparison internally or externally. Oh.. the bs excuse of adding water resistance to the Samsung is the reason it's speakers sound terrible is just that.. BS.. This phone is also water-resistant and sounds excellent. There is a huge difference between being loud, scratchy and grating and being great because this phone goes loud and sounds great.. No Samsung does. #2 Let's talk about it's outdated design for a few. The only people that are stating this are those who are in Samsung's pocket, their fanboys, or those tech writers who think having the thinnest edgeless phone is the most important thing to strive for. The design is a blend of practicality and real world experience. Why.. simply because it makes no sense to to build a phone without something to hold on to when out of a case. Luckily the designers didn't cave into the fad of form over function completely like those from Samsung. The top and bottom is there to support the phone and to give us boomsound. Not everyone loves Samsung designs.. Yes many people do and that's perfectly fine, but just because they don't like how the u11 looks is personal bias...oh...That Jerry rig test... At first I thought... Wow that ain't good and worried about it...heck I even posted this on the thread here... Then I came to the conclusion after really thinking about it .. In all of my years I have never stressed a phone in the manner he did. Ive dropped them off buildings, down elevator shafts, off of ladders and lifts as well as out of treestands, off mountains and into sewers, lakes, ponds, and I have never bent a phone like he did just to get it to fail..Sure I've broken them in all sorts of ways.. and in many pieces But those were out of the normal usage I usually use my phone in.. Of course I'm not doing this to phones to garner ratings either like he does ... Hmm... Think about it.. \nHere is a outright falsehood I have seen made on this thread .. That it is basically useless on Sprint.. I'm on Sprint and I own this phone.. Do they? This phone connects faster than either my s8's or iPhone or even my LG's.. It's call quality is better, it's wifi calling is phenomenal, and I have better reception too so could they explain to me how it is basically useless on Sprint..maybe on Verizon but not Sprint..Do these folks even own this phone let alone use it on Sprint? I don't believe that they do. #3 Boring ui.. Seriously? I suppose to them it is since it is not TouchWiz, but to us it is not boring. It's not glaringly gaudy and to be honest doesn't have to be. The screen size is fine and it's aspect ratio is normal which is perfect for the size. IP 67 vs IP 68... Seriously... I'm mean someone is downing the phone because of this? I have a news flash.. The vast majority of people don't take their cell phones underwater.. IP 67 is fine for the majority of people on the planet. \nNo Samsung phones aren't the best and never will be the best at everything. Samsung phones have just as many issues as other phones and that is the reality of this. People need to stop letting their personal preference blind them to the reality of this and stop spreading bs about a phone they have no first hand knowledge of. I have both of the current Flagships.. They obviously don't and only want to cut HTC down. \nThe u11 is a better phone than any Samsung phone currently available on everything it can do that's been discussed. \nThe Samsung has the best amoled screen on the market.. Not the best LCD screen. Just being amoled does not mean BEST especially on this size of display. \nThe Samsung has the most and best features on the market.. Nope.. They may have the most, but certainly not the BEST and these features are considered by most to be bloat and get disabled. Think Package Disabler here... \nSamsung's are bad at nothing.. Really.. I got news for anyone that believes this nonsense , they are very bad at a lot of things and we've (I) already pointed them out to you. \nOther phones are bad or inferior because they lack features that the Samsung's have.. Reality check... Like what.. It's curved screens that you can't protect , it's batteries that blows up.. It's UI that is gaudy with it's inaccurate colors.. All of the bloat that has to be removed or disabled or it starts to studder.. Has people forgotten that the app Package Disabler was developed specifically for Samsung phones to rid them of all the bloat and not just the carrier bloat.. How about It's atrocious sounding speakers and Dacs..these are superior to the u11? Sorry dudes step away from the Kool-aid. \nAs a actual owner of the HTC u11 and the Samsung's s8's..

Shows what UI optimization can do vs a battery sucking touchwiz. My s8 with 3000mah barely made it to 4:30 and im getting over 6 consistently on the u11.\n-Look of a UI is all overblown. How many of us actually use the stock launcher? We have android phones for a reason and that's because we like the freedom to customize. The look of a UI should not even be factored into an argument. Slap nova like most of us do and you have a stock look and feel. Unless you have a UI like touchwiz which even behind the scenes is draining battery then you have a problem.\n-Lastly, the phone is just blazing fast. Faster than the pixel, faster than the s8, faster than anything ive used. Its not just me, recent benchmarks show its the fastest phone ever made to this point. You feel it as you use it. never hiccups, never stutters. Ill also throw in that the camera is amazing and the best you can find on any phone on the market.

AMOLEDs have perfect blacks, do Always On Displays right, and visual quality isn't diminished by viewing angles (especially when wearing polarized sunglasses).\n- Screen on times between the Galaxy S8 and HTC U11 are basically the same. Samsung phones drain battery faster in idle, but that doesn't matter to everyone.\nEveryone notices when a phone doesn't have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Not having one is a big omission. Headphone quality with the U11 is worse than the Galaxy S8. According to PocketNow, the U11 headphone audio has more noise, less dynamic range, and same amp power. The Galaxy S8 sounds better with headphones. Yeah, the HTC U11 has better external audio, but most people, including myself, don't care about dual speakers as long as the single speaker has reasonable volume. The IP rating does affect the speaker quality as well. The Galaxy S8 is better sealed up than the HTC U11 to earn the better water-resistance rating. \nIt is more practical to have smaller bezels, not larger bezels. Having smaller or no bezels makes the phone size smaller, which means that big phones will fit better in your pocket. It is bizarre to me that you hold your phone by the bezels.

The Galaxy S8/S8+ UI is not gaudy at all. It is very classy.http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/r...iew-051-UI.jpghttps://s3.postimg.org/mputdlmv7/20170705_211258.jpg\nPocketNow tested the HTCU11 with the software they had at the time of review. Maybe HTC could have improved the audio with a patch. Maybe so did Samsung. Can you provide patch notes showing that HTC improved the internal audio? Your ears can be fooled. What can't be fooled are objective tests by computer systems. They showed that the U11 headphone audio was not as good as the S8 and the G6. I use Bluetooth for audio in my car and Audio Technica ATH-M50x headphones when I'm walking around.\nNo, I hadn't read that review. They complain about several of the things I have mentioned -- \"substantial\" bezels, no 3.5mm jack, average battery life.\nSamsungs have not always had \"atrocious\" headphone audio. My Note 5 has excellent headphone audio. If you don't believe me, maybe you will believe these people. https://www.head-fi.org/f/threads/ga...uality.778690/https://forum.xda-developers.com/not...mance-t3186790\nYou can compare them side by side? Congratulations. So can Android Central and guess which phone won their choice for best smartphone? It wasn't the HTC U11. The Galaxy S8 is widely regarded as being better than the HTC U11. It has been chosen as the best phone for official and unofficial awards. The HTC U11 is a great phone, but it isn't better than the Galaxy S8/S8+. You can like the HTC U11 and prefer everything it offers over the S8/S8+ and still recognize the fact that the S8/S8+ is a better overall phone. If you don't think the S8/S8+ is the best phone, at least recognize you are in the vast minority with that opinion.", "time": "07-06-2017 12:32 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5875581", "text": "For the record I have had all of the Notes from 2 up to the 5 several of them actually and passed on the 7 and all of the regular Galaxy series and even 2 of the Actives.. \nI know all about how their audio is with them and stand firmly by what I have said about them. To make any of them sound as good as my u11 you have to resort to adding Viper. \nI've seen both links and also know that the note 5 had some serious issues with their audio. While early samples showed great results most of the mid to end of run did not,thus the need for v4a to be installed. On the s series only the exynos equipped phones are capable of doing OK. The Wolfson dac is decent enough but Samsung's codecs as I have said brings it down, not to mention the various carrier editions too that has multiple issues. \nHTC Sense is not boring and I don't give a rats behind what the obligated web sites tech writers or you claim. This is totally irrelevant because just as you or they think TouchWiz is beautiful, just as many others feel otherwise.. It's called personal preferences...Nothing more.. They have to say nice things, you on the other hand just regurgitate what others say...which carries no weight. \nFurther I do not have to agree that the s8 is a a better phone, just the contrary because it isn't. \nThe design flaws it has makes it impossible to use a quality temperd glass screen protector on it, it's screen design makes it more prone to breaking, it's aspect ratio makes the viewable screen smaller unless the manufacturers, developers and distributors recode just for its usage and just a few have in all the months it's been out, it's software isn't optomized and is slower, it's fingerprint scanner is a joke, and every single one of these phones is loaded with bloat that can't be removed. Why in the hell would I ever say that it is better than the u11...?\nYou should really read that review..like I said to without just keying in on the negative things and listen to what he says.. You might learn something.. You might also read what Andrew said just recently https://m.androidcentral.com/top-5-t...&utm_source=ac\nYes I know that every tech writer and audiophile is having a coniption fit about the headphone jack missing, but no one is understanding that the phone has already received a software update for the adapter and in all likelihood will continue to. It just keeps getting better all the time.. It will never be accepted because these people don't want to give up their already purchased headphones and will go out of their way to bash any new technology that will do this. Hopefully htc will use the extra pins in the new USB format and make it easier to use other headphones as well as utilizing the cord for a external antenna... That is the only con that I have against the phone but that's not a deal breaker for me anymore. FWIW there are many programs that you can run to test the audio on these phones damn few people can actually hear the differences they are seeing with them . I'm one of those who can and I am telling you straight up.. Side by side the u11 blows the US Samsung phones out of the water and still sounds better than all the rest of their phones . The external speakers everyone knows does this too and yes they do matter to millions of people worldwide. \nMac", "time": "07-06-2017 01:32 PM", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post5874215", "text": "In the main components that people look for in a phone, it beats any Samsung device out, no questions asked.

Only hitch had nothing to do with the phone itself: Google did not have my HTC M8 listed when I went to restore. Turned out to be a good thing though, as several apps were no longer needed.\nBattery, build quality, signal strength has been solid. I was surprised that the call quality was fuller and more natural sounding than my M8. Music through the speakers was more natural on the M8, but the U11 had less distortion at louder volumes. I don't know what purpose Theatre Mode is supposed to serve, but I don't like it.\nMy ONE area of concern on the U11 was the headphone jack. I'm a pro audio engineer out of motown records, and the M8 has been a darling for audio... the first phone I would feel comfortable handing to a client in a studio and having them review the last recording session. Incredibly, I kept being interrupted from testing the audio until late at night. Conference call that dragged on forever, kids needing rides, a trip to the AT&T store to replace someone else's phone, my daughter's car breaking down, and my son's car breaking down 15 minutes later. Arggh!\nBut I finally did get the testing done, and the results were a bit surprising. Test results on an oscilloscope and paper are not always an accurate representation of how good something sounds to human ears. An example is the HTC M9: Excellent on paper, but when I got mine, it sounded so bad compared to the M8 that I boxed it back up the same day. I tried to like it, but the grainy top end and forced sounding bass were a turn off. It should have been better. Then last night, the HTC U11 turned out to be another example of what's on paper not telling the whole story. I used two pairs of on-ear headphones for testing; one for enjoyment, and one for work which is more accurate but not as pleasing. I used an M8 for reference because it is still the golden child of headphone audiophiles, though the HTC 10 and LG V20 are close. When I compare lower end phones, the differences stand out. Plug in an iPhone and I can tell on the first note. Plug in an S7 Edge, and it takes about 15 seconds or more to pick out the differences. Compare the M8 and HTC 10, and it's just about impossible to tell any difference, though you might find one song that has two notes in the first measure after the bridge that sounded better to you \nI expected to be disappointed when I plugged into the adapter in the U11. I listened, then changed to the M8. I went back to the U11, went through a few different songs, went back and swapped back and forth, being careful to compare the same recording on the same player. The differences between the U11 with the 3.5mm headphone adapter, and an HTC M8? Very minimal. Most general songs were very difficult to tell what phone I was listening to. It was only with very intricate or complex recording that I was able to pick out differences. An example would be on the Jean-Michael Jarre's album Oxygene. On track four there is a synthesized finger snap that has light reverberation on the first snap, and reverberation plus echo on the second snap. It's a subtle detail that you have to listen to even pick out, but on the U11, there a touch less detail on the echo of the second snap. Yeah... not exactly a deal breaker. The funny thing is that I spend over an hour listening to headphones, then plugged in the uSonics which immediately made my other headphones sound like crap.\nSo your options on the U11 are:\nA: Using uSonic headphones which are better than just about anything.\nB: Using wireless headphones which will sound as good as the headphones allow.\nC: A headphone adapter with it's own DAC which is difficult to tell apart from built-in headphone jacks.\nSo as an audio professional, you can color me relieved.", "time": "07-07-2017 09:49 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5876669", "text": "Thank you for this breakdown on the audio.

But the screen got a defect and it ended up going for repair. They just flat out replaced it for a brand new one (CarPhoneWarehouse, not Sony) and I just sold it on as new but did miss it after. \nI like Sony's version of Android the most out of all I have ever used. I haven't tried HTC yet, but I'm sure I'll get along fine with it. \nThe camera is important to me, hence why I originally wanted the U11, as is audio as I listen to a lot of music on my device. Whilst Sony isn't exactly bad in that regard, the camera could be better, but then it has that slow-mo which I think would be really cool. \nPretty torn. I think I like the look of the XZ more but the HTC would be a more sensible phone to buy I think. But in my experience and usage with phones, I always end up wanting the one that I find the more attractive rather than the one that looks pretty boring.

About Mr. Mobile's review... it is not neutral in nature as it should be,even when he compliments it, he counters with a negative. He neither strived to be neutral, or present his opinion as such. You cannot start a review and end it in a negative manner and expect people to come away from it feeling positive about this phone. That is the crux of this and again what I believe HTC is trying to combat. \nIn this day and age of putting form over functionality, I see that HTC has tried to balance this trend, to appease these critics and still put out a quality product. While it erks some of their core base moving to a glass backed phone and removing the headphone jack in favor of the USB - C adapter, what is gained is a noticeable improvement especially when their supplied earbuds or factored in along with the software to achieve what they are doing, while still allowing the use of individuals prior purchased wired choices.

It pretty much sums up my feelings about all reviewers who give the phone an unfair review. It's clear there are other motivations that make them say awry statements, because the phone itself is so factually amazing, that when these reviewers give it negative marks, it's clear that they're reviewing on a basis of sheer bias or, even a boost to their bank acct from the competitor (imo). Post is long yeah, but who here in the forum shares the same sentiments?... \n\"I'm an avid fan of your channel, Michael Fisher. Very well produced videos, compelling and sensible reviews, all delivered by a charismatic and passionate host. But this review in particular, I find really fishy. It just doesn't add up. Admittedly I am an HTC fan, yes, but that won't get in the way of what I believe are objective observations I noticed from this video. Hear me out.\nThe main basis of my suspicion about this review, is how you reviewed the HTC 10. In your own words, it was \"The best Android phone you aren't buying\". I will not go through the whole list of what the 10 offered, since I believe it's still all fresh in our minds. Yes, it was, and still is a solid phone. Then a year after, here comes the U11. Long story short, if you'd observe both phones, it's safe to conclude that the U11 is everything the HTC 10 is, and more (save for the selfie cam with OIS and 3.5 jack perhaps). If such is the case, then why the sudden negativity over this 2017 HTC flagship? \nHow about we do a run through of what many people/ fans were clamoring for HTC to implement: 1) An IP67 or 68 rating. People were short of furious as to why HTC won't make a damn phone that has good waterproofing. For goodness sake, it was 2016 (back then). 2) A good gimmick. While a gimmick is a gimmick, it certainly makes a phone NOT BORING. Hey there's that word BORING. Because what was the HTC 10 called last year? BORING because it had no gimmicks. 3) Loud Boomsound. To be more exact, people wanted the front facing speakers back. and 4) Good, fair pricing. Especially after the disappointing U Ultra being sold at a ridiculous price vs what it had to offer. \nNow let's have a look at the HTC U11... Doesn't it have ALL OF THE ABOVE?? Save for the front facing speakers, but it's still really loud and arguably comparable to the audio powerhouse that was the M8. It just makes no sense for a negative review when the main features that were wished for were finally delivered; again, especially when the predecessor phone was so highly praised by you and many others. What I am saying is, the HTC U11 is pretty much an improved HTC 10, sporting the 4 additional points I mentioned above... And then you give it a negative review??? Makes no sense after you gave the 10 such stellar marks. \nTo delve even further on how I find this review suspicious, let's look at the points you focused your negativity on: 1) The front face. 2) The name (REALLY??). 3) The contradiction of the fast software blunted by Edge Sense (the \"extraneous gimmick) and 4) Slick multimedia features without a big battery to back it up. Ok, the points you bring up are either very superficial and nitpicky (numbers 1 and 2), or don't add up (3 and 4). Are you really going to give more value and focus to the bezelfull front face and name, over all the other more important features? About the \"The contradiction of the fast software blunted by Edge Sense\" - How exactly does the \"extraneous gimmick\" blunt the fast software?? You know if Edge Sense affected the user experience and slowed down the phone, sure go ahead with your claim. But it doesn't, so isn't it supposed to a novel add-on instead?? About the \"Slick multimedia features without a big battery to back it up\" - Why again are people making this an issue when a) The battery fairs well despite the relatively small size due to the SD 835 processing features, and b) The S8 has the same size too and it fairs well itself! \nIt's crystal clear that you nitpicked on the things that you can, to overrule all the other more important and relevant features this phone has to offer. And well, if you are going to do that on a phone that's actually really good, you're gonna look pretty stupid and obvious. Yeah, that's why you went after the name. I think I've seen enough of your videos to know how you think and rationalize, and if your review of the HTC U11 was really honest, the tone of this review would have been completely different.

However the day I hear the same condescending tone, liberal use of satire, and resentful mood during a review for something Samsung or Apple makes, I might draw a different conclusion towards the perceived bias and double-standard from these reviewers. Case in point:\nThese reviewers weren't clamoring for wireless charging until Samsung did it. HTC wasn't given the same credence when they did it.\nWater resistance wasn't an expected feature until Samsung implemented it. Sony was not given the same credence when they did it.\nTiny bezels weren't a trend to follow until Samsung implemented it. Sharp and Xiaomi weren't given the same credence when they did it.\nLoading the camera software with bells and whistles wasn't a good thing until Samsung or Apple did it. Prior to, they were just gimmicky and probably wouldn't be that useful for users (ex. HTC selective focus, Sony's live masking feature, HTC Zoe pre-capture feature, etc.,)\nApple iPhone's differ little in design per iteration, but that's not a bad thing because people will put a case on them. The HTC M9 didn't deviate much from the M8, and it was Armageddon. This coming from the Verge.\nWith that said, not liking a device or providing criticism isn't the issue.

I have been excited about this phone as I believe HTC has finally made a great flagship device, unlike their previous attempts.  \nUnboxing the U11, you will find the following in the box:\n- HTC U11 Phone\n- HTC Fast Charger\n- USB Type-C cable\n- HTC USonic Earphones with extra ear buds\n- 3.5mm headphone jack adapter\n- Clear case\n- Dust cloth\nAs far as the specs go, the HTC U11 is equipped with:\n- Snapdragon 835 processor\n- 5.5 Quad HD Display\n- 16 MP Front Camera (for those awesome selfies!)\n- 12 Ultra Pixel Rear Camera\n- 3000 mAh Battery\n- Android 7.1.1\nIt is available in three colors here in the US:\n- Amazing Silver\n- Brilliant Black\n- Sapphire Blue\nThe Sapphire Blue is my favorite color though I also like the Amazing Silver.\nOnce you have gone through the initial setup steps such as logging into your Google account, you are greeted with configuring the Edge Sense feature. \nThis will help you to adjust your squeeze force and train yourself to squeeze. Depending on how your hold your phone, this gesture, squeezing the sides of the phone, could be natural for some or weird for the rest initially. \nOnce that is configured and you have set up your fingerprint sensor, you are greeted with the home screen. This is HTC Sense, HTC's Android skin. I quite like HTC Sense as it has very little customizations over Android and you almost get the same experience as you get in a Google Pixel.\nSince the HTC U11 is running Android 7.1.1, you get app shortcuts on your home screen. This is similar to the 3D Touch in iPhone. Just long press the desired app icon on your home screen to see the available shortcuts for that app.\nNext up, I plugged in my USonic earphones and HTC prompted me to create and configure my personal audio profile. U11 will scan the surroundings and will create a unique profile for you. You can have multiple audio profiles and switch between them as needed.\nI love HTC BoomSound and the U11 doesn't disappoint. The sound coming out of the speakers is loud and clear. You can also switch between a normal music mode and a theater mode which basically tunes the stereo effect for those respective modes (music and theater). I talk about the BoomSound at about 7mins in my video if you want to check out how loud and clear the sound is.\nHere is a quick comparison between the U11 and the Samsung Galaxy S8. At the back, the reflective liquid glass surface of the U11 does stand out when compared to the S8. However, in the front, the S8 has a curved, almost edge-to-edge screen display while the U11 has a flat screen with the bezels as you would expect in a normal smartphone. \nAnd, here is a quick comparison between the U11 and LG G6. At the back, there is no doubt U11 shines with its liquid glass surface. However, in the front, G6 has a flat, almost edge-to-edge screen display just like the Samsung Galaxy S8.\nWhile some may argue about the bezels at the top and the bottom in the U11's front, they actually host the HTC BoomSound speakers underneath those bezels putting them to a good use while both S8 and G6 have single speakers that cannot stand against the BoomSound.\nHTC U11 has Google Assitant built-in and also supports waking up the phone with the Google keyword. Once you have configured the Google Assistant, you can simply say - Ok Google - even when the screen is locked to start interacting with the Assistant.\nAnd yes, HTC will be adding Amazon Alexa with an update soon. So, you can then choose between the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, which is cool!\nI am really excited to use the U11 as my daily driver and I will be back with more videos, tips, and tricks for the HTC U11. Make sure you are also subscribed to my YouTube channel where I will be publishing the videos. \nAnd, feel free to share your reviews and initial thoughts about the HTC U11 with Android Central here. If you have any questions about the U11, feel free to browse or start a thread in the HTC U11 forum as well.

To do so, navigate to:Settings->Fingerprint scanner\nThen uncheck the Wake-up screen option to disable this wake-up feature.Edge Sense\nWith a little squeeze gesture to your phone, you can launch an app or a shortcut as such turn on/off flashlight, turn on/off WiFi etc., You can read this post for detailed info on how to set up edge sense in your HTC U11.Navigation button backlights\nInstead of on-screen buttons, HTC U11 uses capacitive buttons for the back and recent keys. The backlight on these capacitive buttons turns on only when you use it. You can, however, change this behavior and keep the backlight on as long as the screen is on. To do so, navigate to:Settings->Display, gestures & buttons->Navigation button backlight\nBy default, this option is set to Auto off when inactive but you can change to Always on when the screen is on.Motion gestures\nHTC U11 supports few motion gestures on the lock screen and double to wake up is one of them. One of the other useful motion gesture is swipe down twice to launch the camera. You can enable/disable these motions gestures at:Settings->Displays, gestures & buttons->Motion gesturesSplit screen window\nHTC U11 comes with Android 7 which also supports the multi-window mode where you can view two apps on the screen using the split-screen mode. To activate this split screen mode, you press and hold the recent button and that will activate the multi-window mode.App Shortcuts\nHTC U11 comes with Android 7, 7.1.1 to be specific. This means app shortcuts feature is available in the U11. This is similar to iPhone's 3D touch where a long press on the app icon reveals different shortcuts available for that app.\nNavigate to the home screen and long press an app icon that supports app shortcuts, like the Twitter app. This will reveal the app shortcuts. You can even drag and drop the app shortcut from that shortcuts list to your home screen.Cast to Chromecast or other DLNA/Miracast devices\nWith a simple three-finger swipe up gesture, you can share your entire screen with Chromecast, DLNA or Miracast devices.Quickly add widgets to your home screen\nWith a simple pinch and close gesture, you can directly navigate to the Widgets screen where you can choose to add widgets, apps, and shortcuts to your home screen.Customize app drawer background\nYou can apply your favorite background to the app drawer. To do so, navigate to the app drawer and tap the three dot menu on the top right and then select Change wallpaper.Remove BlinkFeed\nBlinkFeed shows the latest news and social highlights based on your news outlet choices. By default, BlinkFeed is available on the home screen when you swipe left. However, if you want to remove the BlinkFeed from your home screen, long press the home screen and then select to Edit page. Navigate to the BlinkFeed page and tap Remove at the bottom. This will remove the BlinkFeed from the home screen. \nWhat's your favorite tap?

It is a reseller not an official store, if that matters, but they were very helpful. After entering the IMEI into the Verizon system they couldn\u2019t identify the phone. He tried again and nothing. He then called Verizon and they couldn\u2019t find it either. \nHe then handed me the phone and I talked with the lady who said this phone was GSM and would not be compatible. I explained that can't be possible since the HTC site clearly shows it as an option. Certainly, HTC can't just advertise compatibility when it's not. She then went to the website and was surprised as well. She asked around and no one has even heard of the HTC U11.\nThe Verizon rep then 3 way called HTC with me on the line. The V rep explained this would not work. HTC said sure it will. They went back and forth and V said well if we can\u2019t identify the phone with the IMEI then we can't activate it. HTC put us on hold and came back and forth a few times and said well the HTC and V systems haven't synced up that's why they can't see it. HTC said wait 24 hours and try again. If that doesn't work, buy a new sim card and try again.\nI\u2019m not super in touch with all the technical details but the HTC rep did mention the VLTE, voice over LTE. So, it sounds like that\u2019s the only way the phone functions.

HTC is calling this the Edge Sense. In the video below I go through the steps to setup Edge Sense and also show you different options available to customize the Edge Sense to your specific needs. \nWhile setting up your HTC U11 for the first time, you will also be prompted to configure the Edge Sense feature. Once configured, the default action for the squeeze gesture will be set to launch the camera app. To activate the Edge Sense feature, you just squeeze the phone edges. As the squeeze gesture registers, you will get both a visual and vibration feedback. \nSqueeze harder and you will launch the camera app. You can squeeze again to take a picture. Very handy shortcut indeed to take a picture quickly. \nTo customize the Edge Sense feature, navigate to:Settings->Edge Sense\nHere you can turn on or off the feature completely as well as customize the various options available. \nTo change the default action, that is, launch the camera app, just tap on the Customize squeeze action and select your desired action.\nYou can also adjust the squeeze force level to your desired level by tapping the Adjust your squeeze force level option.\nOnce you have set your desired squeeze force level, you can test to make sure you are comfortable with the squeeze.\nWhile the basic mode provides you with a single squeeze gesture, you can enable the advanced mode where you can have two - a short squeeze and a squeeze and hold - gestures. Now, you can configure two shortcuts for these gestures respectively.\nThe squeeze action also works from the lock screen and when the display is off. However, you will have to unlock the device if you are launching an app instead of basic shortcuts like turning on/off the flashlight from the lock screen or when the display is off. \nOverall, I do find the Edge Sense useful to launch my favorite shortcuts. This is yet another way to launch your favorite apps. After using this feature for a while, it feels natural to squeeze your phone and there is no doubt I will using this more often than I thought to launch my favorite shortcuts. Below is my setup:\n- Short squeeze set to launch Turn on/off Flashlight\n- Squeeze and hold set to launch the Camera app.\nAre you using the Edge Sense feature? What's your setup? Share yours here.\nIf you are interested in more tips and tricks videos, make sure you are also subscribed to my YouTube channel. \nAnd, feel free to share your reviews and initial thoughts about the HTC U11 with Android Central here.

This means that the camera will take its exposure cue from the middle of the image. Alongside this, the camera will have a tendency to expose more than needed. \n(Notice the slightly higher exposure on the top shot captured by the U11 compared to the bottom captured by the Mate 9, which results in slightly more clipping on the U11 shot.)\nThis isn't a new trait to phone cameras as many do the same, although the U11 does tend do it more than some others. This is also noted in DxOMark's review, which remarked that;\n\"The HTC U11 delivers extended dynamic range and pleasing exposures, although sometimes they are a bit brighter than those from other top smartphones. Whether you find that helpful is a matter of personal preference.\"\nThis is in no way meant to bash the camera as it is indeed very good. However, you can make it better still by doing the following;Hop into the camera settings and turn on \"Touch Autoexposure\". This will change the metering mode to spot metering, which will adjust the camera's exposure based on where you tapped to focus.Practice using the exposure slider. This is actually a cardinal rule on any phone camera as fine-tuning can help turn a good photo into a better one.Use HDR whenever possible. It can sometimes help with toning down highlights depending on the conditions.\nThey seem small, but these small changes can turn an already very good camera into a great one.", "time": "06-10-2017 11:16 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Is Digital River involved in amazon orders?", "thread": [{"postID": "post5845431", "text": "I ordered my HTC U11 over a week ago.

I still don't think USonic is that good to justify replacing a ubiquitous open standard with something that's a little more proprietary and while Edge Sense is neat, I personally feel that it would have been more useful if HTC also added stuff more akin to the Nokia McLaren, where the phone can sense the way it is held and uses that info to improve the device's core functionality, such as making auto-rotate more reliable by detecting the way you're holding the device. Aside from the 2 sore points, I think HTC made a solid device that quite a number of people would be happy to own.\nSadly, that number isn't a lot of people in the general sense. \nI think it's pretty clear that HTC's situation is still quite dire. The company's start to 2017 was pretty bad, with the U Ultra receiving no more than a lukewarm reception owing to its high price and was also cited as an example of \"poor use of space\" by YouTuber Marques Brownlee, which went viral pretty quickly. Its smaller cousin, the U Play, also didn't receive a welcoming reception, which perhaps led to the company's revenues dropping 9.3% compared to the same quarter last year.\nWhile the U11 doesn't solve all of the flops the U Ultra had, the phone does at least make up for some of that by utilizing a more efficient processor, which coupled with the slightly smaller display and lack of a secondary ticker should make for solid battery life, along with an improved camera with a similar image sensor to the Galaxy S8 along with improved audio recording, which takes advantage of the device's microphones to enable 360-degree audio recording.\nThe biggest sin that the U11 solves, however, is the price. Unlike the U Ultra, which sold for an exorbitant $750, the U11 retails for $649 on HTC's store as an unlocked device, and if you get the $50 coupon, it drops to $599, making it a much better value proposition than HTC's bigger phone at launch.\nSo you might be asking, why did I put such a title? Sadly, even if HTC gets the price logically right, people will still flock over to buy the equivalent Samsung or Apple flagship, or maybe even LG's G6 despite the older hardware.\nI could say that perhaps the larger bezels on the HTC U11 would make it look dated in comparison to the S8 or G6, which both have slimmer bezels, or maybe that the inclusion of the headphone jack on both devices would make them more appealing, but honestly, I don't think those are the prime reasons. Really, the prime reason is carrier support.\nThe aforementioned devices sans the U11 are sold on most, if not all of the major carriers in the USA. However, the U11 is only available on Sprint or Verizon as a carrier or unlocked, with AT&T and T-Mobile left out in terms of carrier deals (though unlocked versions will work). That's really the problem here as many folks in the US buy their phones from a carrier, usually as part of a monthly payment plan and/or as part of an upgrade program such as T-Mobile JUMP!. I think that's the biggest hurdle for the HTC U11, at least in the United States. Being unable to leverage deals on all major US networks is quite a setback.\nPerhaps HTC is able to carve a niche for themselves not unlike OnePlus with the 3 and 3T, something which I do hope happens. But in terms of targeting the mainstream, I think the U11, as solid as it is, won't make much of a difference to HTC's bottom line.
