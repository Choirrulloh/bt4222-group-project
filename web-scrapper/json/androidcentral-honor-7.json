I put a screen protector and phone case on it the same day. As soon as I turned it on I noticed problems. The screen wasn't responsive at times, especially at the bottom of the screen. I thought, well maybe I can deal with it but the problem worsened. On Monday I called their (crappy) customer service to arrange for phone repair and went back to using my old but dependable HTC. Three days and two more phone calls later they finally sent me a shipping label. \nYesterday I got my Honor phone back. A note said they wouldn't repair it because of liquid damage, which also voided the warranty. The phone has had a screen protector and phone case the entire time I've had it, it's never been near water, but the problems started as soon as I used it.\nI'm furious, obviously called them, but there's nothing they will do. The phone evidently was damaged before they even sent it to me and now I've been ripped off. \nMeanwhile, the problems are worse. The phone will not play sound now. I'm furious. \nIs there anything I can do to fix it, or is there anyway to get Huawei to replace it?", "time": "01-23-2018 01:31 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6144059", "text": "Welcome to Android Central! I moved this from the Honor 7 forum to the Honor 7X forum, just to be specific.\nProbably the only thing you can do is be persistent, and keep calling. Ask for things to be escalated to the next customer service level. Be firm but polite -- don't sound like you're losing your temper, because that will just make them less willing to help. It would have been ideal to take a video of the phone in action as soon as you saw the issue, because the timestamp of the video might have helped show them that you didn't have the phone for very long before the problem started (just something to remember in the future). The problem is that there's no definitive way to prove that the phone wasn't exposed to water while in your possession, so it's essentially your word against theirs.\nWhen you talk to a higher level of customer service, try buttering them up and talk about how excited you were to get your 7X, and how you were hoping to continue using Honor products in the future. Ask them if there's anything they can do to help you remain a Huawei/Honor customer.

This update would constantly fail at 10%. I figured this was due to the 'root' I had on my device. However, this was a partial-root as some things would work and some things wouldn't. I originally rooted my phone with KingRoot. I could not un-root my device with superuser, SuperSU or KingRoot. I tried to install a custom recovery but that failed. I came across a thread with OTA updates and new 'stock' ROMs for EMUI 3.1 and EMUI 4 for my device specifically (PLK-L01). I downloaded this and followed the instructions in the provided pdf. I navigated my phone on windows and copied the entire internal storage to a folder named 'Backup'.I also used  to make a copy of 'all' my phones files - once the command ran it spent 5 minutes skipping 'special files'. I took out my SD card and backed this up too, in a folder called 'SD_Backup'. I formatted my SD card ready for the update file.\nI placed the update.app into the /dload folder on my SD card and typed  and selected Software Upgrade, SDCard Upgrade, OK. The phone promptly rebooted and booted into the update screen. The update went swimmingly until 100% where it flashed Done, then Software Install Failed. The phone automatically rebooted and I was greeted with a setup screen, asking for my prefered language. I figured it had worked, but then to my horror none of my apps were there and all my files had been wiped. I was distraught and still am.\nI after checking the backups after the reset I have found that most, if not all the folders were empty from my 'Internal Storage' backup. I am not too bothered about losing my apps as most of these are cloud apps, however I am most worried about my contacts and messages. I am not installing any apps as of yet, in my knowledge the files haven't been overwritten yet so technically they're still recoverable? I had a lot of contacts that took time to get and knowing my status, it will be difficult to get them back. Additionally, some apps, like the camera, have updated to bring a whole host of new features to the Honor 7, however the music app has not, I do not have 'Screen Candy' or 'Protective Eye Mode' which are shown on the offical EMUI 4 features website here\nSo the questions;\nHow to recover my contacts and/or messages? (Google, helpful as always, did NOT backup my contacts or messages)\nHow to recover apps that were 'installed on SD card'? (As all SD card data is, hopefully, intact)\nHow to update settings and other appropiate apps?\nWHY THE FLIPPING HELL DID THE UPDATE WIPE MY PHONE?!\nIs there any way to recover anything at all? \nThanks so much for reading all of that,\nJake", "time": "08-09-2016 05:32 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Hi, the side button of my honor 6 plus has stopped working. cant switch it on.", "thread": [{"postID": "post5286410", "text": "Hi, the side button of my honor 6 plus has stopped working. cant switch it on. is there any way to deal with this, will it get switched on once it is 100% charged? the side button has stopped working, tried many times.", "time": "07-28-2016 01:27 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5287524", "text": "Welcome to Android Central!
