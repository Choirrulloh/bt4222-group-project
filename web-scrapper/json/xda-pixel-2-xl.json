This the first android device that I haven't felt the need to root/mod the moment I took it out of the box. I have been using the P2XL as my DD for over a week, and haven't rooted it yet, which is probably a record for me lol. My last android phone was a Nexus 5X, which I actually bought for my girlfriend in an attempt to pull her away from iOS. The Pixel 2 XL reminds me a lot of the Nexus 5X, but vastly improved in (almost) every way.\n\r\nI still can't get over how light it is, especially compared to my iPhone 6S+. My iPhone never let me forget it was in my pocket, it was like a brick. The P2XL is a fraction of the weight.\n\r\nThe fingerprint scanner is fantastic. In over a week's use, the fingerprint scanner has missed only once, and I am constantly unlocking my phone. My last experience with fingerprint scanning was on a Note 4, and was so bad that it turned me off fingerprint scanners. But the P2XL fingerprint scanner just works. Period.\n\r\nThe UI is buttery smooth, no hiccups whatsoever...very iOS-ish in that regard. Of course, Nova Launcher takes it to the next level...\n\r\nThe camera is phenomenal, it blows iPhone out of the water. I often had to adjust my position/angle for the iPhone to get the right exposure, but the P2XL gets it with no special effort. Details are crisp and colors are true. I have not yet taken any videos, so I can't comment on that.\n\r\nI love how the P2XL identifies songs playing in the background. I never thought I'd use that feature so much, and I wouldn't buy a phone just for that reason. But it is definitely a nice little extra.\n\r\nThe front facing speakers are a welcome change. Not HTC BoomSound quality, but definitely a step up from iPhone mono speaker (I got so tired of cupping my hand to hear anything in a room of average ambient noise)\n\r\nMy screen has the blue tint that is more noticeable at angle, but it doesn't bother me. The only time I really notice is when I put the P2XL next to another device. It is definitely not worth swapping or selling the phone.\n\r\nThe P2XL color vividness is fine for me. I've had multiple Samsung phones, so I know what AMOLED colors are like, and I don't really miss that.\n\r\nThe battery is about what I expected \u2015 not GNex awful, but not stellar either. Battery life has never been the best feature of android, even after disabling/optimizing everything that can be, yet still have a useful phone. That is one thing iPhone always seems to have over android.\n\r\nI am still getting used to the volume rocker on the right side, and the \"back\" button on the far left (Seriously? Whoever suggested that must have been a leftie)\n\r\nI got a Spigen thin fit case that I love, but still looking for a good *glass* screen cover. Does anyone have a recommendation?\n\r\nEdit: The Spigen case is good quality, but I am already starting to see lint in the crevice between the case and screen, which is irking my OCD. My iPhone had an aluminum bumper case, and I never cleaned lint from it. Maybe someone will eventually sell a metal bumper case for the P2XL.", "time": "16th January 2018, 04:00 PM", "postID": "post75221332", "replies": [{"text": "Whitedome protector is the only best one\nYou can search about it more and will understand what i am saying\nCheers \ud83c\udf7b", "time": "16th January 2018, 05:57 PM", "postID": "post75222749", "replies": [{"text": "Are you referring to Dome Glass?\r\nI looked at that one, and Fakespot suggests the reviews are genuine.

I found an extremely effective non-root adblocker as well as a simple and free solution for swapping the navigation buttons. I am also impressed with Google Assistant. I didn't think I'd use GA, but I find myself using more and more.\n\r\nSo far, my biggest complaint is the lack of aux input. I got an adapter that works well enough, but it is something else to keep up with. I do wish there were more choices of glass screen protectors. I got the one Google sells on their web store simply because I had credit in my Google wallet. The protector looks and feels much better than the vinyl protector I had been using, but sensitivity is diminished in the corners (especially the bottom right).

As you know, the 6P ships with sRGB mode off, and hidden behind developer mode by default. When I first turned it on, I was extremely disappointed by the washed out looking colors, and was convinced that the default mode was more accurate. Then I took a screenshot and copied it and a wallpaper I had downloaded to my computer, which is hooked up to a decent LCD panel set in a relatively neutral basic mode.\n\nThen I pulled up the same images on my phone and computer, and held the screens side by side. To my amazement, the sRGB mode which I thought was dull and washed out, was actually very close to the way the images looked on my computer, but with sRGB mode off, the imaged were way oversaturated on the phone and inaccurate. I then pulled up some webpages on my son's iPhone and on the 6P, and the look was close with sRGB on.\n\nMy conclusion is that the sRGB mode is objectively better, but the default mode is subjectively perceived as better in isolation if you are only used to the way it looks and fools the eyes. I have gone back and forth with both modes on my phone over the past 2 years, and each time, the sRGB mode initially looks dull and washed out, but after a day or two my eyes do get used to the more accurate look, and it looks just fine after that. Going the other way however takes much less transition time, and the inaccurate but punchy mode starts to look good very quickly.\n\nI liken this phenomenon to eating some correctly and delicately seasoned food after getting used to eating overly spiced version of the same dish. Initially the overloaded taste buds perceive the delicately seasoned version as bland, but over time the taste buds adjust, and I begin to appreciate the subtle flavors that become more evident in the version as the recipe intended. Going back the other way takes less time in transition, because the punchy, spicy, flavors quickly are evident, although the version I am tasting now is not following the recipe as it should. Just like spiciness, there is a correct standard of color saturation, defined by the sRGB standard. Punchy, oversaturated modes may look good, but they are not showing the subtle gradients in the images, like they should.\n\nI am a bit concerned about blue color shifting being an issue, but if it is only apparent at tilts beyond normal viewing angles, and is due to having a polarizing layer that improves outdoor visibility, I can live with that. I have zero concern about the grain notes by Ars Technica at 0% brightness in a dark room, because every phone screen looks horrible in that setting, and I have never used my phone that way.", "time": "19th October 2017, 03:40 AM", "postID": "post74212610", "replies": []}, {"text": "All the news about \"washed out\" screen excites me so much!
