Brightness is good here, but I like the iPhone's color balance the best.\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most shocking of the day photos, and you'll see why. Take the bridge photo with the walkway and the people. If you look at the beams over the cars, there are posters/stickers on them. The iPhone is the worst, but even the Galaxy can't touch the Axon in how it actual renders readable text. The pole between the walkway and the beams is another example. The iPhone and the Galaxy show blurriness on it, while you can make out the words and graffiti on the pole in the Axon. Finally, the people on the walkway are more detailed on the Axon at a distance. If you use the people standing near the trash can/bench in the distance, the Axon clearly renders the most detail on faces and bodies.\n\r\nOverall, the Galaxy produces the most consistent pictures with the best overall balance.

Recently we have used Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and S4. Actually we are satisfied with both phones very much so far. We haven't had any signal or Wi-Fi issue for years. So I compared A7 to them. We were in a place where gsm/3G/4G signal strength was very poor. Practically it meant zero inside the building and very poor in outside. My first experience was that I got signal inside sometimes with A7 but apart from this gsm and data capability was the same around the house. It is poor of course. \n\nLater at home I did some measurement by using Network Signal Info. I put phones next to each other. Both got SIM from same provider (Vodafone) and they connected to same tower (LTE). Signal strength was between 70 and 80 dBm during the test and from time to time I exchanged phones in position. I did test horizontal position as well as vertical position. Well I would say that A7 and Note 3 performed on very same level. May be Axon was better with 1 or 2 and rarely 3 dB more times than vice-verse but it was hard to diagnose. Also the position was very important. Phone which was in a particular position performed better almost always. I repeat the test with S4 too. May be it is better than other two but I have to emphasize that differences were very-very tiny. Rather I would say that 3 phones have same signal receiver capability. \n\nWi-fi. I can say same. ZTE has same signal strength and data transfer rate as Note 3 but I have to emphasize here as well that many-many things can impact the result included the position of the tester near to the phones. \nI copied files from to PC via Wi-fi and Total Commander showed same rate as in case of Note and S4 earlier.\n Finally.
