Below is the list:\n \r\n1) Battery \r\nThe battery just wont charge. I have hold the phone very carefully in a particular position so that the charger starts charging. Even if it connects after so much of pain, it takes 6 to 7 hours just to charge 30 to 35%. After all that battle with just connecting the charger, all that efforts goes in vain with just a slight touch to the phone. Now, the battery which takes 7 hours to reach 35% of power, drains in just 20 mins.\n \r\n2) Heating \r\nThe device is a stove. Sometimes, while the phone is in pocket, I feel like the phone might just burst any moment. It heats up for nothing. It was understood if the heating was due to its heavy usage. But, here the device heats up even when its kept idle.\n \r\n3) Lags & Hangs \r\nThe device hangs anytime and at least several times a day. The phone memory is not even 30% utilized but still it hangs like its paralyzed. Needs a hard reboot everytime.\n \r\n4) Shocks / Electrocutes while charging \r\nIt can give you electricity shocks upon touching the rim of the phone while charging.\n \r\n5) File Manager error \r\nIt just wont show the thumbnail of the videos saved on the device. I have to open each and every video to see what it is. The problem persists even after restarting the device several times.\n \r\nThere are several small issues which i just cant think of right now.

First, packaging is very great. came with screen protector on the phone and the box is very neat and labelled well. Charger is a bit odd, but its basically a double contact flat thing that goes into a USB port. So its a USB - without the issue of it getting loose over time like other USB cables. Flat noodle cord with it is nice, and has a built on rubber strap to secure while rolled up. Crazy amounts of customization. contact colors, text colors, I am running the Beta for Shelf on mine too and its fantastic. screen is awesome, the gestures work great. The things I find surprising and odd would be the home button isnt a real button. its just a flat panel that has the sensor in it. Also the backplate is textured which was nice. Very well put together, everything is snug and feels much more sturdy. LOUD ringer. Dual sim thing is nice, but I will never need it. flash is bright, camera is fantastic.

Unfortunately, it looks like Android is slowly and progressively wasting my memory resources, and I think that is due to app updates, not a phone fault.  \r\nI also enjoy using the fingerprint sensor to quickly unlock the phone, and contrary to others, never had problems with it. I wish it could be used in apps as well, but it looks like I have to wait for Android 6 to be available. \r\nThe battery does drain in less than a day if I surf the Internet using mobile data half a dozen times. This happens to me on weekends. \r\nOne thing that really annoys me is the sharing of contacts via Bluetooth with my car hands free system. But I found in the net users with all kinds of different phones complaining. It's Android 5's fault. The latest oneplus version now transfers contacts, but, unfortunately, a person with multiple numbers is being replicated at the car. My older phone with an older Android version showed a single contact at the car and allowed me to select its desired number. \r\nSometimes, I lose the GSM signal while other people around me have three bars of strength. Android's fault again?  \r\nPhotographs wise, I had to install a different camera app, because the default one distorted the images. \r\nI would have preferred the speakers to be located elsewhere because when I hold the phone with a single hand, my fingers obstruct the sound.  \r\nIn short, it is a good phone!  \r\nBut let me warn you not to buy silicone cases from Oneplus. I bought one together with the phone, in late November 2015, and it resisted less than 3 months. It deteriorated, with erosion and parts falling apart. I complained and got to know from Oneplus that the warranty for accessories is only 15 days. So, they are not responsible for this crap they sold me.

At that time i read some reviews and watched mkbhd and barnaculas nerdgasm videos on YouTube and opo impressed me a lot. At that time i needed a dual sim device as i used to travel interstate.  Still this phone had me hooked so much that i bought it on Jan 2015. My previous phones where xperia ray,  galaxy note 1 and xolo q800 (still working and too good). First thing i noticed was the camera quality of the new opo dint impress me.  Neither did the short usb cable which became loose after 1 day. I was also not impressed with opo battery life unlike others who experienced great battery life.  So after about 20 days i sold it.  From then on i was waiting patiently for oneplus' next phone.  When i came to kno abt the registration i registered in opo immediately.  Then i realised that list is not permanent and had to so some spamming to bump my position. When the released opo i thought i ll get the invite easily as i was below 1k in  tge registration list.  But to. my surprise i came to know that its not the priority list for distributing invite.  I was disappointed and thought i  wait till 20 th Aug or else i ll buy another phone.  Somehow i got invite on 19th and OP2 on 22nd.  \r\n       From then on am using it extensively. At first i dint like the weight of op2. Am used to it now and even hav an armour case. Phone feels really solid in the hand and the sandstone back (more rough this time)  is super  grippy.  Feels great to hold.  After 2 days and installing all apps i felt the battery life to be poor with SOT of about 3.5 hrs.  As a friend suggested i charged the phone overnight for 2 days and made some tweaks on the phone and the life improved to abt 4.5 hrs of SOT which is good to last a typical day. i dont play much but i hav installed many games like asphalt 8, wwe etc.  One thing which amazed me was that while gaming OP2 dint drain much battery unlike other phones.  Its a great newz for gamers.  \r\n  Kudos to Oneplus team for rolling out updates so soon.  i must say that after the 2nd update the battery life improved even more with more than 5.5 hrs of SOT which is awesome.  \r\n     Yes there are some glitches, oxygen os is not polished.  \r\nThe finger print sensor may not work if u keep the phone idle for 30 mins or more how. much ever you try. Am sure it will be solved soon. To make fingerprint faster its better to use jus one finger print. There is no issue with home button too if u disable fingerprint.  \r\n     Camera seem to be good enough for me and takes some fantastic shots.  Front cam too is good.  \r\n    Screen is bright and crisp.  \r\n          I am not happy with the loudspeaker. Its weaker than opo. But if u use a good headphone its good. The wifi connectivity is average. Voice clarity and reception also are great.  \r\n    Another glitch is that if u use dual sim, sometimes the phone decides itself which sim is default for calling, even if u set it as \"ask everytime\".  It was the most annoying thing for me.  \r\n   Charging time is about 2 hr 25 mins and 24 % in 30 mins.  Its not too bad, but will miss quick charging.  Also u ll need usb type c cables or adaptor if u need to charge it somwer else or in ur car.  \r\nHeating issue?  Not so much..  Only on gaming and that too not unbearable.  \r\n      Overall am satisfied with OP2 so far.  I have never used NFC or am not a fan of wireless charging.. Hope Oneplus will iron out the oxygen os and make our experience better. I have never reviewed a gadget before and kindly excuse me if you find anything wrong.

Is their system flawed????.... Absolutely.... Is it frustrating wanting the device but not being able to just got the store and buy one???.... Absolutely..... But everyone has to understand that most start up company's go broke from not knowing how to strategically manipulate their cash flow. What the invite system does is allow them to see exactly how many devices they need to produce in order to meet the demand. That gives them control over their spending which inevitably allows them to manipulate their cash flow. Creating too many devices without enough customers to buy them gives birth to a stagnet inventory. If your inventory is stagnet with too many devices you are essentially making an investment with no return. Its like putting money in a bank account that just keeps it. I believe,in time, their system will improve. I believe in time the amount of devices released to the general public that have not been purchased using the invite system, will increase dramatically.
