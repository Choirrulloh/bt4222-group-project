However, for the past few days, I've been having the following problem ...\nWhenever I open the camera, I get an error, which, roughly translated from Dutch, says \"Camera is recording audio. Com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox:interactor can't open at the moment\"\n(I added a screenshot)\nIf I tap \"OK\", the error message disappears, but pops right up again seconds later. I can use the camera, but it is of course very annoying if you can't see what you're snapping pictures of.\nI've been Googling about this and I found out that Quicksearchbox refers to a search box or Google Now. However, I do not have a search box widget on my screen and I also don't see the connection between the camera and that, nor the link with Google Now.\nI can't find any topics about the entire error on Google.\nDoes anyone have any idea what's going on?

I really cant tell Im using a 1080p screen.. its so crisp and clear and really bright.. great colour depth and rich reds and blues.... I cant comment on battery yet.. but ill add it at a later date.. \nAs Ive only unboxed my P9, the shots ive taken have all been on AUTO, SOO.. the camera is not as DSLR amazing as Huawei claim it is.. but its very good, nice and crisp if a little lifeless and flat on a dull day (Like today).. its on a par with the S6 edge, amd the G4.. but not quite the G5... however, that said.. it has so many settings to tinker and experiment with, its possible to make alot of changes... It doesnt have OIS.. but I dont think it needs it, the EIS or DIS.. does a fantastic job... out of 21 photos.. I only lost 3 to camera shake, and even then.. it was my own fault\nSadly, the P9 only has a 1.25 micro pixel size, compared to the S7E, 6P and G5.. which have a 1.55 micron, which means the P9 cam detail does suffer a little when being heavily cropped in that being said,, I really like the camera as it can deliver some truely stunning shots.. but sometimes a softer image is what looks the best.. not every photo has to be super crispy.. especially in macro or candid photography... So, well done, Huawei.. you made a good one.. keep it up.. Unfortunately, YouTube has everyone going hysterical and slamming Devs if you cant read a car number plate Cropped In 1000x from half a mile away with your latest camera on your phone..\nLoud voices in phone calls, Build quality is beautiful.. much nicer and sexier than a Samsung... The single speaker is surprisingly good and quite full sounding..nice and loud for RingTones... its on a par with the G5.. Headphone Audio is eally great using Sennheiser 422s and LG Quadbeat 3s, loud and punchy.. plenty of depth and instrument separation, but can struggle in choral works.. playing Def Leppard, Bee Gees, Mark Knopfler, Vangelis and Franz Lizst \"Missa Choralis\", and with it having an SDCard.. you can rip in flac...\nTBH... Theres not alot wrong with this phone at all.. so far... yes there was too much hype made about the \"Amazing\" camera.. which is truely great, but wont replace my Canon DSLR quite yet.. but the fantastic audio side, stunning 1080p screen, awesome build quality and, IMO, interesting EMUI 411 make it a pleasure to use.", "time": "10-27-2016 04:12 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5528879", "text": "Enjoy! \nThe camera takes a little getting used to to figure and get good results but is worth the effort IMHO.", "time": "10-27-2016 05:32 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5569479", "text": "hi, i want to ask you few questions about the p9, because i want to buy a new phone and i read some bad comments about the max vol on headphones, its true? i mostly play rock- electronic music and what can you say about the signal strenght from the wifi and 4g antenna?. \nThx, and excuse me for my bad english hehehe.", "time": "11-18-2016 05:21 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5575601", "text": "I'm in UK with a UK L09 running B182 stock firmware and not Rooted and I find the Wifi great.
