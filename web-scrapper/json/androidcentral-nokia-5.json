It's also updated with Android security patch of August 1, 2017.\nSince half of the internal storage already taken by the OS,I'm left with the other half remaining which resorted me to buy a 32GB microSD card (Sandisk Ultra C10). At first, I was using it as portable storage to put picture,video etc. But after knowing I'm capable of transferring app from internal > sd (after formatting it as internal), I thought I might give it a try to save more internal space. Back-up my SD card data onto and then format it as internal. After done with the formatting, I turn off my phone and open it back. I can still see both my internal storage and SD card is detected on the phone screen Setting>Storage.\nThe problem comes when I plugged in the USB to my PC but only the original internal storage is seen and not the formatted SD card which makes me unable to transfer the backup data back. I've read about this kind of problem from lots of forum/web and try few of the following methods but none seems to be working:\n1) Deleting the data and cache of External Storage and Media Storage (System App) and then reboot it.\n2) Clear cache partition in the recovery mode.\n3) Change USB option from 'MTP' to Charging while USB was connected to the computer, then while still connected, change the USB option back to MTP.\nWould appreciate if someone could help me fix this problem.\nThank you.", "time": "08-28-2017 02:21 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6168233", "text": "", "time": "02-21-2018 07:57 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5995990", "text": "Any luck yet?

Thank you!", "time": "10-30-2017 06:08 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6047695", "text": "You\u2019re right in deducing that adapted storage is for apps, portable is for photos/other data. Not many apps (if any) will go on portable. With adopted storage, the phone treats the card as an extension of its own memory. And everything is encrypted, so that the particular phone it was formatted in will be the only thing that\u2019ll ever be able to access anything on the card (so something to think through!). I\u2019m not familiar with Nokia phones (mine\u2019s a Motorola), but I think this applies to all phones.\nIn mine, moving existing data (e.g. photos) from the phone\u2019s own memory to SD card is done by fetching them from the SD card, in the phone settings under Storage. And telling the camera to store photos automatically on the SD card is done from within the camera app. If your camera\u2019s not recognising the SD card, maybe you didn't tell it to save to internal memory? In which case it\u2019ll still be expecting a card formatted as portable.\nCloud storage? Yes. If nothing else, because the more backup methods the better (and cloud storage is a painless one, as it can be set to happen automatically). Like everything else computer related, the best place to start is to decide what you want to achieve, and then on what scale (then double it!). Then it\u2019s horses for courses with choosing one (or more) of the options out there. For instance, Google Drive storage is the most direct one with Android and plays nicely with the other software, and Flickr is a good one to consider for photos (I use both).\nIt doesn\u2019t sound as if you\u2019ve done much research re the things you want to learn about. I recommend it - there's so much how-to and explanatory stuff out there. I was new to smartphones, touchscreens and Android when I got this phone 2 years ago, and only started using it for anything except calls, texts and camera a year or so ago, since when it\u2019s been standing in as my only computer. In my remote location the search bar\u2019s been my chief teacher (and a fast one!). Android's Central's a great place to start (on the other hand, the wider web can sometimes get more results re topics that aren't Android specific such as this one).\nI think the title of your topic is good (about as specific as you could get in the length), but to get more responses you need more details about your setup, what you\u2019re trying to achieve and what you\u2019ve tried so far.

Here are my initial impressions based on my pretty short time with the device.\n\u00b7 Build quality at first glance is pretty dang good. It's a metal chassis all around, and it really does feel nice, and the device also has a reasonable amount of heft that adds to that solid feel. I personally don\u2019t like thin devices made out of glass and feel overly light, and the Nokia reinforces my thought. It really does feel nice.\u00b7 Now, this won\u2019t win the \u201cslimmest top and bottom bezel\u201d award since they are pretty chunky, actually chunkier than what I would\u2019ve preferred. But at the very least, there are capacitive buttons alongside a fingerprint sensor on the chin, so that space is at least used, even if the fingerprint sensor itself is strangely small.\n\u00b7 The 5.2\u201d display is a 720p IPS LCD and for a budget phone, it\u2019s par for the course. Brightness is reasonable and colors are accurate, but contrast is a tad on the low side, although since I was in a store that had some harsh lighting, I would have to try it out again sometime to verify my thoughts.\n\u00b7 The phone runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat and\u2026.that\u2019s about it. Aside from some Nokia tweaks and a different camera app, it\u2019s pretty much close-to-stock, which should make those looking for a Nexus-like experience on a budget pretty happy.\n\u00b7 The specs are also typical for a phone at this tier, at least in some markets. It\u2019s powered by a Snapdragon 430 backed up by 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Because it\u2019s running on a relatively lean build of Android, performance is more than adequate in terms of daily use. It\u2019s obviously a tad slower and more prone to hiccups than my flagship Moto Z, but for the usual texting, browsing and calling, it\u2019s more than adequate, and based on my experience using the backup phone I have, which incidentally has the exact same processor and RAM combo, battery life should also be very good due to its lower power use, although a 14nm process would\u2019ve helped further.\n\u00b7 And then we come to the camera. I didn\u2019t use the selfie camera since I do not take selfies regularly, if at all. The 13MP sensor has PDAF and an approximate pixel size of 1.12 microns, making it a 1/3\u201d sensor, and has an aperture of f/2.0. In good lighting, the camera is capable of some solid photos with good amounts of detail and sharpness, although make no mistake, this is obviously no PureView. When the light goes down, the lack of hardware stabilization is made more obvious, and you\u2019d need a bit more effort to get a steady shot. The first indoor shots I took looked a tiny bit soft until I properly stabilized it. That said, the focus is pretty darn quick. For $189, it is a capable camera, although one that also needs the user to know its limits. \n\u00b7 The camera app is a tad confusing at first. While it is very familiar to the Google Camera, the one that I\u2019ve been using for a while, it certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt to add exposure compensation for automatic modes, at least one that I could find. Haven\u2019t tried the manual controls yet, though.\n\u00b7 Oh yeah. The buttons. Nobody mentions them often, but they are very clicky. Certainly a nice touch.\nAt $189, this is going up against phones like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy J5/J5P, BBK\u2019s Vivo Y55 in some markets, alongside the standard Moto G5 and a slew of Chinese competitors that offer similar specs for less or beefier specs for the same price or a little more.\nThe Nokia 5\u2019s spec list isn\u2019t going to impress anyone, and its featureset is definitely on the lean-side compared to some of the aforementioned competition. However, what Nokia does deliver on is a very solid handset that has very solid build quality, an Android experience that purists will definitely like and the promise of speedy Android updates, where it is even mentioned on marketing material.If specs are your primary concern, then offerings from companies like Xiaomi are bound to be up your alley. But if you like a pure Android experience and prioritize the overall experience and timely updates, I think Nokia might have a chance.
