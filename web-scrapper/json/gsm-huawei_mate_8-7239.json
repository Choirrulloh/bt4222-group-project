Launching and switching between apps are really quick, at least for every core apps such as phone dialer and messages while heavier app such as camera will take a few seconds but once it load, switching between camera and other app is fast.

I had iPhone 4s first, LG G2 (2 different ones), LG G4, Galaxy S5, Huawei Mate 7 and Mate S. For the last year or so I have Mate 8. Yes, it's getting a little boring and I tought about buying S8+ just for change, but after few minutes i asked myself, \"Why\"??? \r\nI cannot find a major downside of owning Mate 8. Looks very good, I get lots of questions about it and it is old already. Metal build is great because I use all of my phones without case and I have dropped it at least 15-20 times. I has lots of damage, but it works perfect and the screen survived everything. So, I know it is very durable y friend uses 6s Plus for similar period of time, also without case, and his phone has worn out on the sides, which is not the case with Mate 8.  \r\nAlso, performance is smooth. There is no lag, never, nothing. It is fast, responsive, never \" freezes\", never slows down. Of course, you need to optimize it, turn off all the unnecessary stuff that you don't use etc.\n \r\nScreen is big (6 inch, very sharp, colors are accurate and I can't see the point of putting QHD on 6\" diagonal. Ok, VR is a real reason, but in this stage of development this techonolg is still a gimmick. It's fun for a few days, but later you get bored using VR ser on your head. So, I believe that Huawei made a smart decision sticking with Full HD.\n \r\nBattery life on this phone is amazing. I work on TV station and I am a power user. My screen is never dark because I use screen brightness at 70% + all the time. \r\nWhatever I do, I simply cant believe how good is the battery. My friend who is not a power user charges it once in 3 days. \n \r\nCamera is good, very good for tips, tourism, selfies, but is not great. Camera is like VW Passat. Good, has everything, drives good, looks good but is not good as (let's say) Mercdes CLS. \n \r\nAt the end, this phone is top, top class.

", "date": "05 Nov 2016"}, {"text": "Hey everyone. This is my first ever post on this site, so im kind of excited about it. I would first say that this phone was a replacement to my lost HTC 10. I was looking for a new phone and wanted to try something new. Through out my entire search, I was left to choose this phone and I would like to say that this is the best phone that I myself has ever used. I live in New York and the only major issue that I have with this phone and the company is that they do not offer support for the phone if you live in America. This is a huge problem for me because I want to install Android Nougat 7 with EMUI 5.0 but the updater keeps me at Android 6.0 EMUI 4.0. If anyone can help me with this that would be totally awesome. Although this was a big down for me, everything else about the phone is why I looked past this flaw and stuck with the phone. \n \r\nThe IPS NEO LCD screen is amazing in 1080p  even though the HTC 10 had a 1440 pixel screen, but no major difference is noticeable unless you are a screen geek. I never used a IPS screen and it is definitely what it is from what I researched. It is supposed help you see  your screen from any angle and any angle is exactly where you can see the screen as clear as you would as if you where directly facing the phone in front of your face. EMUI  is such a beautiful software HUAWEI designed for Android. The best spec of this phone is that massive 4000mah battery. Oh man how long have I waited for a phone that can be left on full brightness while using phone throughout the day moderately and not having even to think about if my battery is going to die or even when it is going to kick into power saving and even if it does go to power saving mode, it will be towards the end of my day at work or when i get home and it would still go through the night if I let it when i go to bed. Just spectacular. Huawei also have great SIMPLE built in apps unlike SAMSUNG. I run through all of my apps with out any hickups, but that is to say that this is because I have super tweaked my settings in the phone to my needs and this phone is just super super smooth. 4 GB or ram is more than enough and I rarely hit 2.5. The Kirin 950 processor is new for me and is just as good and if not better than Snapdragon. Alot of people are disappointed with the speaker but I don't see the problem with it. Its sounds good and I will tell you all right now so please read. I had the HTC 10 which has the dual speakers and are supposed to be the best sounding front speakers since the HTC M7 which I also had and the m8 but the Mate 8 speakers is DEFINITELY louder than the m10 speakers. In my opinion, if you want great speakers for music, then go buy a boombox not a phone or go buy the HTC M7 or M8 or M9 because they have freakin amazing sound quality with music and the exclusive boomsound on HTC which enhances sound quality. Pretty sick. I just use some expensive headphones if I want superb music listening quality. Thats all. The phone is also thin and light which is excellent for a six inch phone. The microphone recording quality on this is also excellent. I recorded my voice and played it back and it was so crisp and clear to hear myself speak after recording a note on the phone. Well ending on this note, again if anyone can help me find a way to update the Android OS in America, I would greatly appreciate it. There is no word on the Mate 9 yet, but already from the experience I am having with this phone, I don't doubt that I will be upgrading when it released. I am a new fan of HUAWEI and I hope that you guys can provide support in America for phones that are not supported here even though we can use it in America at about 90% of its full potential. Thanks you guys and gals for reading my first post and please any all feedback and responses are welcome. I look forward to being part of this community.

Anyway the speaker is louder than the speaker on my old Galaxy Note. I love the big screen and the battery life is phenomenal. The things that I don't like is the user interface. There is no way to change the fonts. The manual show you two ways to change the fonts. One is to go to settings-display and just below font size should be font style. Not on my phone. The other way is to open the theme app\u00c2\u0097customize and under icons there should be font style. Again this is missing on my phone. Also in settings there are no headings on the gray bars, they are blank. I have sub headings but no main headings. On four occasions the screen stop working. I touched the apps, capacitive buttons, the notification bar and nothing worked.  I had to turn the phone off wait 30 seconds and turn it back on to get the screen to work again. As far as updating the phone goes, I have owned this phone four five months and have not received an update.  I would like to know where that guy got his info about updates from.

The professional mode can compensate for the lack of exposure but setting it up can be a hassle and Time consuming. Especially taking videos at night. By default, I set it on the highest setting which is 1080 at 60 frames per second which delivers extremely well during the day but using this setting at night will deliver really dark footages. \n \r\nDespite the lack of camera quality I would still choose this phone. My top priority at the time of scouting for a phone was performance (not laggy) and battery life. \n \r\nFor those in the Philippines who are recontracting your Globe postpaid plan, you might be hesitant to get the Mate 8 over the LG G5 since the two have a similar cash out value - don't be. I chose performance and battery life over unconventional and seemingly attractive bells and whistles. No regrets here.

Also had shortly Xperia Z5 which was complete thrash. Well done, Huawei!", "date": "03 Jul 2016"}, {"text": "I recently got the Mate 8 (upgrading from an old iphone 3...yes I know...dark ages) and am pretty happy with the quality. The UI looks similar to the IOS so I was right at home from the get go. The phone setup took minimal amount of time and was able to get it running on T-mobile in less time than it took to drive to the local branch. \n \r\nSo far the phone has been great, no lag,  no dropped calls etc. Battery lasts a really long time. The only issue is that the charger does not work here since the phone was not released in the US. I can charge it with other chargers but I suspect I need  a special one if I want to hit the advertised 37% per 30min.  Either way, I was able to plug it into the ipad brick and it gets back to full in a couple of hours.\n \r\nOverall, pretty happy with my purchase. This feels like a faster version of my ipad :)", "date": "03 Jul 2016"}, {"text": "LED notification not work with Viber and WhatsApp.Focus camera in low light poor, mediocre video.", "date": "02 Jul 2016"}, {"text": "I have this phone two months now, and i would like to share my opinion, because i read a lot of comments.\n \r\nIts price is high (around 600$ actual, 500-550$ looks more fair), but this might be a psychological game, since other flagships (S7,G5 etc) cost somewhere there (little bit more) as well.  \r\nPhone might look cheap and not good if its cost was lower. But in any case it deserves it. \r\nIn general, look, design and build quality is great. I think that you can hold it easier with a case, because bezzels (left/right) are narrow. \r\nSince its camera sticks out, it isn't stable while its placed on a table. A case corrects that...  \r\nIt is one of the fastest phones in every day tasks (i don't play games, so i don't know), and it gets a little bit hot only while charging (in 1 hour you get around 70%). \r\nScreen is very good, even under bright sun, and i find FullHD resolution perfect fot its size (6\"). Its excellent choice since it offers decent battery life. \r\nFingerprint scanner is fast and -almost always- accurate. I found speaker normal, nothing special, note that it has one speaker in the right side, i guess that left side is for microphone and symmetry reasons.\n \r\nRight side buttons stick out a little bit, i have pressed power/volume button(s) by mistake a lot of times. If you put a case it gets better. \r\nNotification led is small, not very bright, but elegant, suits with whole device. Unfortunatelly it doesn't work with Viber application.\n \r\nBattery life is really great, one of the best out there (easily 2 days with \"normal\" use). It only stays behind in 4G surfing. (It seems that here is not that efficient.) \r\nSignal reception is pretty good and stable, comparing to other phones. \r\nCall/Sound quality is good, call speaker is not loud, i leave it in full even while i am indoors. Even some 20$ phones have louder call speaker, so why not to have a louder one here?  \n \r\nRegarding EMUI/SW i agree stock android is better option, but i think EMUI is not bad. There could be plenty of improvements in user friendly perspective (a lot of settings are hidden and hard to find).  \r\nIf you have the willing to spend some time to search EMUI you will see that it offers a lot of usefull options while its fast.\n \r\nSim/SD card. You can't use both 2nd Sim and SD-card at the same time (unacceptable, i can't believe that there is no space). Stop using hybrid Sim/SD-card slots. (Add a dedicated SD-card slot!)\n \r\nI left cameras for the end. Front/selfie camera is good. Rear camera is mediocre. It takes moderate photos, while video is almost bad (far away from S7 for example). \r\nSo rear camera should have been better, for its price. I haven't tried latest B320 firmware where Huawei says that there are optimizations in camera,  \r\nbut i don't feel that Sony's sensor is that good. (If you are looking for a phone with good camera this is not an option.)\n \r\nThere are several references about battery draining (usually after upgrade). These can be fixed by restoring to factory settings. This is painful, but i don't know if there is any better option.\n \r\nTo sum up, mate 8 is a good phone, with prons and cons which i tried to describe above. \r\nThank you and sorry for big post.", "date": "01 Jul 2016"}, {"text": "I like my phone alot I had p8 max before but that was so big to carry but this one is great for sure there are some cons like some apps in google play wont work on kirin cpu but other than that rest is good.\n \r\njust hope huawei release mate 9 with 3 slots two for sims and one for micro sd.

I have 2 Canon DSRL, a Sony RX100 and a few  compact cameras (Canon, Panasonic, Kodak) so it's obvious that quality of the camera for me is one of the most important features in a smartphone. After getting the Mate 8 I must say that I was surprised by the general good quality of the pictures I could snap. After about 6 weeks I would rate the camera with a score around 7/8 (out of 10).  \r\nHere are some UNEDITED pictures I took, you can judge by yourself:\n \n  \r\nThere are better camera phones out there (Huawei P9, Samsung S6 and S7, LG G4, G5 and V10, iPhone 6 and 6S to name a few) but they are not without faults and often the quality of the pics taken with the Mate 8 is VERY close to them. \r\nMate 8 has a good general purpose camera, the focus is reliable, the lens is good (I cannot see a significant image degradation at the corners of the image), it has an effective optical image stabilisation, the exposure is good, the colours are natural and even in low ligth and high ISO the pictures are comparable (if not better) to the ones taken with a Canon or Panasonic compact camera.   \r\nLimitations?  \r\n- HDR mode is not particularly effective (could be fixed with a sw update) \r\n- not the ideal camera for macros (it cannot focus closer than 7-8 cm) \r\n- some noise is visible even at low ISO in areas of homogeneous colour, in particular the blue of the sky. This is a choice by Huawei in order to preserve the details of the image. All  cameras with a small sensor have a lot of noise visible in the raw file. Then the jpeg engine settings determine the amount of noise that remains in the finale jpeg image file and the level of detail that will be sacrificed. The noise in Mate 8 pics can be easily removed with very little degradation of the image by post processing with sw like DeNoise or Noiseless (for OSX). \r\n- sometimes the white balance (particularly with a cloudy weather or in the shade) is not spot on \r\n- cannot easily freeze fast moving subjects.

I will summarize the changes which i have noticed ;\n \r\n1. In simpler words, Mate 8 has become super quick after the update( Feels like upgraded from a V10 engine to a V12) \r\n2. Huawei claim better power efficiency over the new update and I have to agree on that.  Removed from charger at 100% at 7:00 AM and now its 2:16 PM (in Dubai) having 78% left with a Screen On Time of 3 Hours (Gaming+Facebook/Instagram + Camera etc)!!. Definitely better. \r\n3. I feel camera quality also got better and with better exposure and overall quality. There is a mixed reviews about the camera on this phone. But personally i consider this is one of the best in the current flagships and always got best results on my photos. Low light situations are a bit mediocre though IMO. Remember its the user take the photos not the camera. If you know , there are plenty of options in this phone  :) \r\n4. The user control over screen temperature  is now unlimited. Try it for yourself. \r\n5. Health App has been added with a simple, clean & accurate interface. \r\n6. Google now on tap feature, exciting for those who make use of it. (Which I'm not using/disabled) \r\n7.Observed a hike in Benchmarks ie, geekbench 3. Single core is now 1750 (Stable) Multicore at 6300+(Stable) \r\n8. Betterment on the already best RAM management ( 2.5 Ram always available even after multitasking for a long time)\n \r\nWell guys, his is my observation in a nutshell , over 24 hours And must say im really enjoying this smartphone prodigy  Mate 8 , than ever.
