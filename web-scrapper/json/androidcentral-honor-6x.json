The interface experience is roughly the same and I promise I'd know having owned the honor 8 twice. Real world you hardly can tell any difference in performance or speed. One other difference is that it still runs 4.1 EMUI which I actually liked better than 5.0. Overall the phone feels huge to me compared to the Honor 8. So the biggest difference is feel. Software wise you get the same experience. Don't get me wrong the 5.5 inch screen is nice to have but I just find it to be a bit too large. 5.2 of the Honor 8 is a pretty good balanced screen size for a phone. It's definitely not a one handed device. I've also found it to be plenty zippy enough browsing the internet. Sites open quickly and apps do not lag either. Watching YouTube or a movie on it is much better of course. I'd say the Honor 8 just gives you that premium feel where the 6X does not. It actually seems to be lighter than the Honor 8 which again comes back to feel. For 179 dollars it's got to be one of the best phones for the money out there. I almost went with the Moto G5 plus as it went on sale today for 199. In fact I'm still thinking about it simply because it has a 5.2 inch screen. Then lastly a friend of mine texted me tonight and said he was selling his 128g iPhone SE and that he'd sell it to me for $150. That's a big time killer deal as it's less than a month old and comes complete with box. If I take the 6x back it'll be because of the deal I can get on the 128g iPhone SE. However I know the SE screen size is just too small but being that it's a 128g it'll retain pretty good value which should be well above the 150 I'm paying for it. It's a buddy deal and one I don't think I should pass up. I'll actually save money getting a much better phone. Had I had another honor 8 I'd probably had just passed on it but the 6x just doesn't have the overall premium feel that the Honor 8 has. For 179 for a new device you'll find it hard to find a better phone for the money in regard to the 6x. I just hope my friend doesn't change his mind by tomorrow as I'll use the SE until the Honor 9 is released then sell the 128g SE and buy the honor 9. Plus I've owned the SE twice now so i have several cases for it already. I just can't pass that deal up being that it's a 128g which is way more space than I'll ever need but it's the most expensive SE you can get and at 150 it's a no brainier. I wish I could keep both but only one so if my friend does not change his mind then the 6x I'll return and wait out the honor 9.", "time": "08-26-2017 01:42 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5939430", "text": "That's pretty awesome to hear that it performs so well, and that there isn't much difference in performance!\nHow does the metal body feel compared to say the iPhone?", "time": "08-26-2017 05:52 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5940664", "text": "Not quite as premium from a weight standpoint.

Now with the launch of Honor 6X today, with the same price tag of Honor 5X, Honor 6X has really got some key upgrades.\nInstead of writing couple of paragraphs here, I will quickly compare the key factors in below table which will give a clearer picture of the comparison and lets you deicide if 6X is an upgrade to Honor 5X.*all the highlighted things are really an upgrade here.\nLet\u2019s consider only base Honor 6X variant, based on the above table we can clearly make our decision and can decide for sure if Honor 6X is a real upgrade to Honor 5X with some key factors like upgradable to Nougat with EMUI 5.0 vs the Marshmallow with EMUI 4.1, 3GB vs 2GB RAM, 32 GB internal memory vs the 16 GB internal memory, improved 16nm architecture vs the traditional SD 616 processor, increased 2.1 GHz and 1.7 GHz processor speed vs the 1.5GHz and 1.2 GHz respectively, 3340 mAh battery vs 3000 mAh battery, dual rear camera with improved 8 MP front camera vs the single 13 MP camera with 5 MP front camera, additional 2.5 D glass design vs a regular design and out of the box VOLTE and OTG support. Only thing that is missing here is the dedicated SD card slot from Honor 5X which gives you the luxury of expanding the external memory with dual sim support but thats not a shows stopper here as 32 GB internal memory will fill the gaps.There are many other aspects to compare which can definitely get the Honor 6X a real win win situation here over Honor last years mid budget flagship Honor 5X but that\u2019s how the smartphone technology evolves year on year.\nPlease post your thoughts on the same in the comment section below.", "time": "01-24-2017 04:32 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Honor 6X USA Version 32GB (Sensor List)", "thread": [{"postID": "post5650989", "text": "This phone is excellent but there is a lot of misinformation out there.
