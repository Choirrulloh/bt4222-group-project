I can almost guarantee if you are having these issues it is a non-carrier device...except for an iPhone or Pixel, both of which are supported directly by the manufacturer without any carrier interference. \nUntil the carriers open up access, people are going to blame their phones for these so-called signal and reception issues. Carriers are trying to push VoLTE as a 'premium' service and want us buying 'supported' devices from them, on a plan. \nMeanwhile, somewhere in fine print they will tell you VoLTE service won't work 100% of the time anyway, because of network and device compatibility issues.

Missed deadlines, broken software and a camera that had potential but ruined by crap software. It had supremely exquisite hardware but its issues at launch made its price tag hard to swallow.\nThings have changed a bit now after countless software updates and a new price tag. It's still not what I'd call supremely great but it's significantly better than it was.\nOf course, sales numbers are pretty paltry, so I'd assume Rubin and Co. would like to do better this time around.\nHere's what I want them to do for the Essential Phone 2018Keep the hardware. Essential almost nailed it when it comes to exquisite hardware. Yes, it's probably one of the least practical materials out there since it is a fingerprint magnet and pretty shatter-prone due to it being ceramic. But very few phones have a ceramic back and a titanium midframe, which makes it an exquisite piece of tech and makes it feel much more expensive than it is.Keep to the ethos of \"Essential\". Have little bloat and refrain from adding unnecessary hardware features.Improve the reliability of the software. Don't need further explanation partly because it's self-explanatory and partly because they're already doing so.If it doesn't work, ditch the dual-camera array and go for a single-camera setup with a big sensor and intelligent post-processing. The current setup has heaps of potential but if Essential can't realize it, leave it out of the second one and use a more traditional setup. Then maybe put it back on the third one if it can work out better.Commit to 3 years of updates and patches at least.Headphone jack maybe?I don't know pal.\nUSB-C audio hasn't caught on much, if at all. Almost all USB-C buds suck in one way or the other (or even as a whole) and the dongles are an utter mess. I have tried a Motorola dongle, a Xiaomi one and some others. The Moto one only worked with the Moto Z and the Xiaomi one only worked with the Mi 6. They never worked with my Note8 or the Honor 8 Pro or even my ASUS gaming laptop.

I had sound, I could make phone calls again. I called my dentist. I checked my messages. I rejoiced. Six hours later, the phone went silent.

It had somewhat still wet droppings on the plastic, but luckily not the phone.\n- Also during the boot up it had two dead pixels on the display, one of which has since corrected itself I believe and the other isn't as noticable but I know it's there when I'm on a darker background, but I have to look for it. I put in a request with the support team to resolve.\n- There's some stutter or hesitation in some instances where it takes multiple taps or is just slow. \n- Also don't love the white paint surrounding the display and connecting antenna bands, I just feel like it'll get dirty and look like most iPhones do.\nBut overall it's straight up love and adoration for this device and it being universally unlocked made the choice so much easier when Verizon or Sprint are the only carriers I get service with in my workplace.", "time": "11-07-2017 09:16 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6058278", "text": "That's GFRP (glass fiber reinforced plastic) and not paint.

Those who do speak positively tend to get followed by those who aren't having positive experiences and the bad drowns out the good, even if the bad is only a fraction of the good.

They seem to only have about three full-time email jockeys working their support system, all of whom give as short of an answer as possible to move onto the next message. Surely they're buried right now and overlooking details. In time they'll hire more people and things will seem normal. For now it's going to be a bit disappointing for anyone expecting Amazon-like responses from just a few people.\nOn returns, even if the number is small compared to the number of units shipped, they're clearly under-staffed to handle everything at once. One could reasonably argue that it's better to run your current staff at 200% than to hire too many people and waste salaries. The latter is what puts new companies under.

But it works.", "thread": [{"postID": "post6106254", "text": "Quick backstory: I was an early adopter. Pre-ordered and went through a bad experience getting the PH-1 and then finally returned it. Felt it was a disaster and not worth 700 with the terrible camera, screen touch issues and HORRIBLE customer service. Plus I was moving to China and realized I should stick with my reliable iPhone.\nFF to Nov. Lots of updates reportedly make the phone better. More importantly, the price came down and on cyber Monday I snagged it for 399 with 360 camera. I am now in CHINA so getting it here wasn't easy. A friend of mine knows a pilot so I had it sent to that guy in Washington and he took it with him back here to China. Now it is in my hands and I have been using it for 5 days. \nThe camera is still trash. REALLY bad compared to my now 3 year old iPhone 6S+. I bought my lovely lady a Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 (which also features ceramic and a large screen to body ratio) and it is fast, lovely, with a camera that is just as bad. So the ceramic phones suck for cameras. \nHowever, I am not having any lag or touch screen issues. I also have no problem (so far) with the 4G signal (the PH-1 is much like the iPhone 6S+, having all the 4G bands needed for China and Asia). The phone is performing nicely. \nLet me state that since Google is blocked here the phone was completely useless until I could get a VPN on it and that was not easy. HOLY COW it was a struggle! It took two days of work to successfully get a VPN installed and the updates needed. Right now I basically use the VPN 100% of the time by having it set to automatically connect upon powering up.\nThis first gen phone was a good idea and has amazing build quality, but is not worth 700. It just isn't. If it had a camera that could at least match the iPhone 6 line, yeah, I'd say it's worth it when you consider newer iPhones are not at stupid price levels. But a bad bad BAD camera is not acceptable at flagship prices. \nWhen one talks $400, well, that's different! I am still carrying my iPhone. Both are in my pockets. Eventually I will be full time with the PH-1 but there is a step learning curve so I need to get used to Android before I can stick my iPhone into my desk drawer (I'll never sell that phone since it's the last iPhone with a headphone jack). \nBy the way, I bought the white phone. It's super cool looking. If only I had a case! This sucker is slippery as heck. The ugly gray Tudia carbon fiber is on order from Amazon (the only one that can ship overseas). A shame that the clear cases do not ship over here. I had two different ones sent to family back home (they were sent to late too get to the pilot on time) and in January they will get to me here. \nAmazon has two screen protectors listed that I found here in China. The company name listed is Mocolo.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076BNV9M8...cUvbUpU6106254\nBoth are inadequate. The black full screen protector reduces the brightness of the phone and the other one does not reach the edges of actual screen content. That is rather lame. For now I have the full screen protector, which I am sure will not be compatible with any cases. \nWhat I hope for is a successful PH-2 with the ocean depths color. THAT will be something I'd go for (if the reviews are good). Then I could give this PH-1 to my lovely gal's son.

I have noticed though that the signal strength indicator at my location shows weaker reception than my other phones and the phone that preceded this Essential. The others (Samsung, LG and ZTE) show stronger reception, usually 4 out of five bars (80%).\nThe Essential does not have a bar indicator but my best approximation of its signal strength indicator is that it fluctuates between 25% and 50%. Yes, it fluctuates even when I am seated and not moving around. I am located in a metropolitan area so I am surprised that the Essential shows weaker reception than my other phones.\nI have observed 100% reception strength on the Essential when I am outside the home such as the mall.\nDespite the indicated weaker reception, it has not affected my use of the Essential. It works fine. 25% or 100% signal strength, I wouldn't know the difference when using it if I did not look at the indicator.\n--------------------------------------\nUpdate, Jan. 21, 2018:\nLooks like I spoke too soon. Bottom line for my experience is that this phone does not work well with MetroPCS. Obviously, some others on T-Mobile and MetroPCS do not have any problems. So, it is a YMMV (your mileage may vary) situation.\nFrom my experience over the past month (though it started well), the phone is \"temperamental\" at my location on MetroPCS. Sometimes, it works very well and is fast and at other times, its slowness gets me so very frustrated. The inconsistent performance happens at the same location, not that I am moving around. Some days good, some days bad. Even on the same day, I get inconsistent performance.\nI have tried very hard to give it a chance, trying different settings, etc. I have read forums here and elsewhere and taken others' suggestions. Alas, the Essential phone is still temperamental. I wanted to wait for the Oreo update (I did not do the beta) but it is coming to the end of January and it is still not out. \nEssential's latest Reddit communications give vague and somewhat evasive answers to the reception issue. I do not feel assured they know what the problem is. No information as to what they are doing to address the problem.\nI am generally willing to give any company a chance but I'll be damned if I will go through another \"BlackBerry-like\" experience. I was so loyal to the berry, even getting the Passport which failed on me after only a few months and I never was able to get recourse on that. That was the last straw and I switched to Android and have wondered why I did not do so sooner.\nI very much want to keep this Essential phone but I keep thinking of my misplaced loyalty to BlackBerry so I have decided that I will sell the Essential. If they do release another phone with no reception problems and the reviews are good, I will certainly consider getting it.\nI now regret getting rid of my Huawei Mate 9 for the Essential.\nUnderstand that I am not saying that the Essential phone doesn't work well with MetroPCS. Just that it doesn't play nice where I am. Switching carrier is not an option for me because I have four phones on a very good deal with MetroPCS.", "time": "12-16-2017 08:08 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "New Update", "thread": [{"postID": "post6058914", "text": "Nov Patch and Fingerprint Reader issues fixes.\nMy love for Essential is growing.", "time": "11-07-2017 04:36 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6107388", "text": "Agree 100% this is a solid phone", "time": "12-14-2017 10:10 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post6058919", "text": "I definitely like the fact that they keep putting out more and more updates", "time": "11-07-2017 04:40 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6058975", "text": "Nice!!

My Note 4 was about 6 months past its actual usability date, and this phone is a revelation!\nUnlike many, I am coming from an older phone which maybe makes this experience different.Look and Feel: I did extensive in store testing of the various flagships, including the LGV30, Pixel 2 XL. Note 4 and IphoneX. A lot of people seem to equate \"all glass\" with premium feel, but I think this phone feels dramatically better than any other phone. I love the solid weight, the uneven bezels look fantastic, while still also looking bezel-less. Essential>Current Flagships>>>Note 4Screen: Aspect ratio: First of all I am not a ginormous fan of the stretched aspect ratios. But of all the phones, I think the 19:10 AR that Essential uses is the best. The 5.7\" display equates to about a 5.5\" 16.9 display (important for many apps and videos) which is a great size, only .2 inches less than my Note 4, as well as only .2 inches less than the Note 8 with the 18.5 to 9 display which is almost 1/2\" taller. 16:9>=19:10>2:1>>18.5:1\nDisplay quality: The display looks absolutely fantastic in both default mode AND sRGB. It is bright detailed without being technicolor. It is way better in my view than the Pixel 2 XL screen or the LG V30 screen. The Note 8 screen is better though. The Note 4 OLED is not in the same world.Note 4>Essential>Pixel2/V30>>>Note 4\nResponsiveness: Way faster than my Note 4. I know it had issues initially, but those seem to be fixed. From my testing it is on par with the Pixel and ahead of V30 and Note 8Essential=Pixel2>LG V30>=Note 8Speaker: Kinda crappy. Not horrible. About the same as my Note 4, but well behind the Pixel, Note 8 and LG V30 Pixel>V30>Note 8>Essential=Note 4Headphone jack or lack thereof: OK big thumbs down for the lack of a headphone jack. That said the dongle works great with my Hyper X headphones and sounds terrific. I know LGv30 is better because of the DAC, but I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sound with the dongle, and less annoyed with the whole dongle thing that I thought I would beLauncher: Super plain but fine. The lightly skinned Pixel 2 skin is far better, and I actually like the V30s implementation. Hate the Note 8 skin and just all the crap and baggage their skin has. I am pretty clueless on other launchers to use. For me:Pixel 2>Essential=V30>Note 4>Note 8Camera The big one I guess. I am not a photo enthusiast and will admit that sometimes when someone posts comparative pics of other pictures from other cameras to lament how bad it is I see usually nothing to only a minute difference. But coming from the Note 4 the camera is AWESOME. It is way faster (yes I know, slow compared to other flagships) and takes pretty amazing photos with point and click compared to Note 4. I know it's not the best, but still a gigantic upgrade for me, and I took a bunch of pictures that all looked great to me. The Note 4 pictures always sucked. Super soft focus and washed out. Essential>>>>>Note 4 Not knowledgeable enough to rate others.\nSo in short I find this phone absolutely amazing. It is SO much better than the Note 4, it is unreal. And I have never felt a more premium feeling phone.\nAt $425 from Amazon, with payments to boot it is an amazing deal. I also like supporting a company as passionate and involved as the Essential team and suspect it will only continue to get better and the PH-2 if they keep the construction and look and feel is likely to be spectacular.

Samsung packs the s8 full of **** you can't delete ever, the only apps you can't delete on the essential are the core google apps. \nYou will get Oreo on essential before the s8, you will get every update faster on the essential phone.

Speakers are analog devices so a DAC is required to convert digital sound and audio to analog speakers or headphones. Essential uses the Qualcomm SoC DAC for the internal speaker.\nPutting a discreet DAC inside the adapter meets USB-C specs better than what Moto did by making their adapter pass-through from the Qualcomm SoC. Moto's adapter is dead in any other USB port where Essential's adapter (+ HTC and Google) actually works with audio in any USB-C port so long as a driver exists.

You'll be using the VoLTE feature so the voice call will be using the LTE bands along with data. The simplified story is that when in an LTE coverage area but without VoLTE turned on, the voice calls go over the CDMA network and data goes over the LTE network. Phones only have one radio antenna now so you can't do both CDMA and LTE at the same time. There were some older Verizon phones that could do simultaneous voice and data back when their network was all CDMA but those phones had to have two radio antennas. They started dropping the second antenna in 2014 as their LTE network was improving. I had a Droid Turbo back then and it was a bit of an issue when they introduced the phone with one antenna and no VoLTE capabilities so no simultaneous voice and data. It took them several months to roll VoLTE out in an update and even then it wasn't usable in my area because calls would drop whenever you lost the LTE signal.

I did not have this in my 6P. the second is the finger print reader. this is a minor issue but its bottom edge is not flush with the back while the upper edge is.

[{"title": "Why you STILL should not buy this phone even at $499", "thread": [{"postID": "post6033706", "text": "As an early adopter of devices I have pre-ordered many of phones and electronics. The promise of an essential phone that handed you a pure android experience with out all the BS was exciting. I mean, who couldn't resist Andy Rubin's musings about giving us a sturdy, sexy phone that would last for years? It was to be Android's iPhone.\nIt is not. It is a cold hard tablet made of titanium and ceramic (with a disgusting plastic rim around the screen that constantly dings and scratches) that is suppose to be close to invincible. It is not. After 3 weeks mine slipped from my work slacks onto the tile floor at the office. It cracked. I was sitting down in a rather low chair (approximately 2 feet) with a slight lean back. Thanks for the ceramic backing that is incredibly slippery! My screen shattered into 1.1 billion pieces with sharp glass and chunks making half the phone unusable with out slicing the tips of the fingers to shreds! (this is exaggeration) But the point is the phone is less sturdy than say my original Pixel which I dropped multiple times before the rear glass broke (not the front screen).\nMaybe a rigid titanium and ceramic backing is a terrible idea. When you shove glass into a rigid square you make it much more prone to breaking because the energy pass through is more intense than it would be with say, an aluminum phone.\nOh well, I bought insurance for a reason. I did contact customer services to complain that the phone should not break with a single drop that hit a corner but they said \"accidents happened.\" Not when their website promises a break free drop on concrete!\nAsurion sent me a brand new phone, in a brand new shrink wrapped box within a week. (That was a bloody week for my fingers). On that topic the box looks like one of those cheaply designed boxes from Thaihland when you purchase non-name branded electronics from Thailand. That is to say, the box is essentially ugly.\nBack to the phone - That beautiful body does look rather dashing on your desk. When google now or the home screen is open the brilliantly shaped screen with the small camera notch looks futuristic and splendid. It reminds me of what Motorola tried to do with the Droid series in 2012 - cold, hard, strong, bold, and anDROID.\nThe problem with designing something that has a cutout in the screen is that almost no apps support the black bar at the top. This leads to an ugly mess 90% of the time you use the phone. After more than a month with the phone there had been no updates to apps to fill in the screen. So, the phone is only beautiful when left on the home screen or google now. I would suspect many apps do not care to fix this.\nOnce you get over how beautiful the home screen looks you have to pick it up - because the near bezeless edges make this phone so thin and so short like it could be used with one hand! Well you can't. Seriously you cannot. Not only is the phone so heavy but it makes your workout shorts want to come off while running. The back design is so poorly thought through because there is no design! It's literally a right angle edge all the way around making this behemoth feel huge. It's very, very (that's a lot of very) difficult to hold with one hand. There's a reason almost no phone in the past 2 years has tried this design and maybe Andy should have paid attention.\nThe final issue I'd like to highlight is probably the most important of all. The radios in this phone are incredibly bad. Wifi signals are short range (half of the pixel 2 and pixel xl) and the switching between Wifi and data is miserably slow at times. Google itself only made a promise to work on handoff from Wifi to data a year or so ago (looking to copy iPhone). So the concept is new to android phones, but I cannot forgive the essential phone for how bad the connection is. You could shut the door of your bedroom 15 feet from the router and lose all your connection (even when ever other wifi connected device in your house works). \nLike many people, the unlocked phones are great because we can say \"Screw you!\" to the man (phone company) and jump between carriers any day we want. Too bad the essential phone can barely work on T-Mobile. I admit that is the only carrier I have used it on but with my Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Moto Z, and One Plus 3T I've had great service in the same exact locations at the same exact time. So why can't the Essential phone keep up with these other flagships and the 3T budget phone? I don't know who to blame here, the architecture designer and use of old radios or the industrial designer who thought it was a great idea to use ceramic and titanium on a phone; making the radio waves bounce inside of dense metals and glass never to escape to the light of day! (long sentence).\nSo lets be honest with ourselves. The ideas that were spun by Andy himself were amazing, wonderful, delightful, and down right exciting, but this phone is not the one Andy released to the public. This phone that he got us giddy like a kid on Christmas eve is not the essential phone. (It's probably the Pixel 2 XL)\nP.S. Don't buy the 3D camera either.

The use of ceramic and titanium does make the phone better at scratch resistant, but nothing is drop proof. No matter what a company's marketing department says, we as customers have to make our own educated decision. While Essential has an upper hand at being scratch resistant, the ceramic back makes it more slippery which can easily cause it to slip out of the palm or pocket. So a protective case may be necessary for added traction.\n2. In case of a drop, there are several factors to consider - angle of drop, surface on which the phone is dropped, height from which it is dropped, the point of impact, is there any tumbling after the first impact, etc etc. No two drops are the same and when I see youtubers doing drop tests, it just makes me cringe since those are not scientific or 100% reproducible.\n3. Some folks here pointed out the usage of sapphire. Sure Sapphire is stronger than glass, but with manufacturers using gorilla glass 5, which supposedly offers comparable performance with Sapphire, makes it better at meeting price points. Sapphire coating a glass screen (HTC phones) is okay, but what would really make a noticeable difference is if the entire front was made of sapphire, which is also cost prohibitive (remember Vertu phones from the past).\nThere is a lot that can be said for and against the phone. But in the end, we all have to think and decide for ourselves. Is the Essential phone with an excellent build quality, stock adnroid, flagship specs like other phones, at $499 worth buying? IMO, yes...but then there are some that might think otherwise and that's fine too.

Tried to cancel my Pixel 2 XL order the day they announced they dropped the price to $500 but the Pixel had already shipped that morning. Once I had the screen issues with the Pixel and requested the RMA I got the PH-1 and out the box it was buggy.. but after about an hour and 3 or 4 updates it was way better. it does need a case and it's highly disappointing that there are very few options for it. I think Amazon has ONE case in 3 colors and Viva Madrid has one. Outside of that the secondary market for this phone is HORRIBLE!! \nI do believe there will be a second generation device at some point in 2018. They have a TON of financial backing and last I read they had them valued at close to $2 billion. They almost couldn't give them away at $699 or even $599 but in the Dallas area when they went to $499 every best buy had them by Thursday when I was returning my Pixel almost every best buy was sold out (not that each store had 100 in stock but still) at $499 it's a steal and I think a lot of people picked them up once the price dropped so low. \nI've got the one case on order from Amazon.

The short version though\u2026 on a \u2018solid\u2019 day of use (for me), I was very happy with the battery performance of the Essential PH-1.\nHi All,\nI finally had the chance to really field test my Essential phone over a \u2018full\u2019 day with the Essential as my primary device.\nI have 2 handsets in use at any given time, but decided it was time to use my Essential for everything to see how it would go.\nKey Items to note:\nSettings that were always on except for the time I was in Airplane Mode:\n\u00b7 Adaptive brightness ON\n\u00b7 Location set for \u2018High Accuracy\u2019\n\u00b7 Bluetooth ON\n\u00b7 NFC ON\n\u00b7 Wi-Fi OFF\nSo, here\u2019s my day\u2026\nEssential plugged in overnight with all Apps closed and alarm sounds for my 4 AM wakeup call. \nI have an early flight out of Newark for a sales meeting that night in Miami. \nTime to take the Essential off the charger. First thing I do is have a look at notifications \u2013 texts, alerts etc. Google scares me because it alerts me it\u2019s time to leave to Newark to make my flight and I really wasn\u2019t planning on leaving for another 45 minutes. I also get a notification from Gmail regarding my upcoming travel.\nI open messages and see a couple of texts I received overnight. I\u2019m too nice to reply to people at 4AM. I open the Southwest App to double check my flight status, open Outlook to check my (exchange) work email for anything important and Facebook to see what\u2019s happening (I don\u2019t use FB Messenger). I also open google to check the weather\u2026 I\u2019ve been meaning to install a weather app, but haven\u2019t (note, weather apps do tend to be battery hogs IMO).\nI let the Apps remain open since I\u2019ll be using them a little later. I shower and get dressed etc. I pull up Uber, secure a ride\u2026 kiss the wife a quiet goodbye and I\u2019m out the door with my bag at 4:45AM.\nIn the car I check more emails and notice a message in a thread I\u2019m subscribed to from \u2018Android Central\u2019. I click the link, open the app and check out the thread and then peruse other items of interest.\nI also go back to the Southwest app and pull up my boarding pass.\nOpen \u2018The Score\u2019 to check how my teams did the day before \u2013 dang NY Rangers lost! \nBack to Facebook to post an update about my Sunday trip to Miami (and a quick stop to visit Grandma in Ft Lauderdale before the meeting).\nIt\u2019s a short trip from NYC to Newark Airport at 4:45 on a Sunday morning so I end up at the airport in 35 min.\nSo far open on my Essential:\n\u00b7 Gmail (3 personal email addresses)\n\u00b7 Outlook\n\u00b7 Google Chrome\n\u00b7 Google Messages (Text)\n\u00b7 Facebook\n\u00b7 Android Central\n\u00b7 Uber\n\u00b7 The Score\n\u00b7 Southwest App\nGet to the airport, and jump into the security line. I flip to the Southwest app and pull up my boarding pass. As I wait in line I tend to turn on the screen after it times out (set to 30 seconds) to keep the boarding pass at the ready. I do this often on all my trips out of habit.\nSecurity line isn\u2019t too long and I\u2019m through in 10 min\u2026 One more look at the Southwest app to find my gate. I\u2019m an hour out from boarding\u2026 I grab a coffee and as one does\u2026 mess around on my phone. I click the \u2018G\u2019 on the search bar to open google and check out my cards and Trending News. I then pull out my laptop \u2013 open up the \u2018Entrust\u2019 app on my phone to get my updated VPN security code and check a few more emails and spreadsheets.\nOn the plane:\nI put the phone in Airplane Mode and turn Bluetooth back on\nI close all other apps noted above\nI Open Audible (a well known battery killer)\nOn the plane I didn\u2019t do much on the Essential. I just listened to an audible book for about 2.5 hours.\nWhen I landed I turned off Airplane mode and started checking out notifications as I waited to de-board.\nTexts and Gmails for the most part and a message from Marriott letting me know I can check in to my room\u2026 I open Google Messenger, Gmail and the Marriott App and check in.\nI close the Audible App (It's a must).\nNext stop \u2013 rental car. Walk out to the National Car Lot and land a really sweet ride \u2013 Dodge Challenger!\nUnfortunately the car includes \u2018UConnect\u2019 and I prefer Android Auto, so I don\u2019t connect my Essential to the car.\nBefore pulling out I take a couple of pictures of my supercool rental to send out to my wife and my boss (No they are not one in the same \u2013 though some would argue that my wife IS the boss). I then call my wife to let her know I\u2019ve arrived safely.\nI open Maps and tell it to navigate to Grandma\u2019s house. \nOne thing to note \u2013 OK Google is VERY responsive on this device.\nNAV boots right up and before I know it I\u2019m on my way to Grandma\u2019s house. Volume-wise I had to keep the windows closed in order to hear. Probably something I wouldn\u2019t have noticed if I connected it to the cars audio.\n40 minutes driving and I\u2019m at Grandmas for a few hours. \nThis is where I relax on my usage and spend quality time. I do take about a dozen pictures of grandma and share them with my family via text and also double check Maps for directions to head down to my hotel and the meeting later on. I just want to be sure I give myself enough time.\nAlso, I did look at the weather as I bought grandma a new thermometer for her balcony that needed calibration. I also looked up instructions on how to program a phone number into her \u2018cordless phone\u2019 from 1991.\nOpen on the device:\n\u00b7 Chrome\n\u00b7 Gmail\n\u00b7 Outlook\n\u00b7 Google Messages\n\u00b7 Google Maps\n\u00b7 Facebook\n\u00b7 Camera\n4:20 I leave Grandma with her friends and I head out. First I call the wife to tell her about how Grams is doing. Then I open the Marriott App to get the address of the hotel. I speak \u2018OK Google Navigate to hotel address\u2019 and follow instructions to my hotel. Navigation is again quick and painless. On the way to the hotel I stop at a local store to buy some bottled water. I just can\u2019t bring myself to pay $5-$6 for a tiny bottle of water at the hotel\u2026 I digress.\nI go to the hotel Marriott App in hand, but turns out I don\u2019t need it. I\u2019m already checked in.\nHead up, unpack and send a few texts. Change and head out\u2026 all the above apps still open plus Marriott.\nGet in the car, look up the name of the venue for tonight\u2019s meeting and tell OK Google to take me there. I arrive a few minutes later.\nAt this stage I don\u2019t do much with the Essential other than show it off to a few folks \u2013 love that home screen rotation \u2013 an then it\u2019s purely a camera.\nI take about 100 pictures of the Sales event from 6:30 until 9:45PM. I do send and receive a few texts and send out a few random pictures as they happen, but really just using the camera.\nWhen the event is over I tell google to take me back to my hotel. Maps takes me to my hotel. I call the wife to say goodnight when I get back to the room. Next I do my usual check of Gmail, Outlook, Texts and Facebook. Giants and Jets lost (The Score)\u2026 Get ready for bed and then look at my Essential for the news from the day. It\u2019s 11PM\u2026 time for bed. The Essential is at 14%. Time for both of us to recharge\u2026\nI honestly felt like that was a pretty good battery experience especially with location on all day, Uber and Maps usage. When I use my other flagship handset I would have to plug it in for a boost at some stage between 4 and 6 PM. \nI didn\u2019t look at the \u2018Battery\u2019 settings to view what\u2019s been using the device since my last charge at the end of the day. Just a heads up in case you wanted to know what that looked like. \nSorry, just didn\u2019t think about it.\nAnyway, if you have any questions about the Essential or about my experience feel free to ask.\nThanks,\nRick\nAs part of a device ambassador program I have the glorious opportunity to test out multiple devices by multiple manufacturers and write my opinions.

No electronic stabilization (EIS) - camera software can support it, if Essential develops it. No rumors or news about it right now.\nSo if camera is the most important decision factor for you, you should stick with the Pixel or Note 8 or iPhone 8. If camera isn't the most important thing, then there is plenty to like about this phone:\n1. Flagship specs on a $499 phone.\n2. Outstanding build quality.

Yeah, I know weird.. happy about a new phone is an odd way of putting it. Maybe, it just feels good and makes me smile. \nLook, I have an opportunity to trial tons of new handsets from utilitarian to flagship and yet somehow this Essential Phone with LESS tricks and gimmicks is my current favorite over all. It\u2019s hard to put a finger on exactly what it is (no pun intended).\nI don\u2019t know any other way to put it.. the haptic feedback on the Essential phone is.. delicious. No, you can't change the vibration intensity (yet), but I don't want to. It just has the perfect feel. I think part of the feedback feel is due to the solid body design with the titanium and ceramic. \nRunning a finger across the screen feels SO nice. It\u2019s the nicest touch screen I\u2019ve run my finger across to be honest\u2026 so smooth. My finger literally glides across the surface. I don\u2019t use screen protectors any more. Just too much hassle and often times reduced responsiveness. So, with no screen protectors I can say when comparing this to say my S8+, the glass is just less 'tacky'. \nSwype typing on the Essential PH-1 is a pleasure and I find it to be much more accurate than on any handset I\u2019ve used thus far. That's pretty impressive.Just 21 pre loaded apps\nSnappy! OK, so I only just got this thing and barely loaded it up with Apps. I wanted a clean start \u2013 and what that means is a clean phone. Essential, not just a clever name\u2026 only comes with 21 \u2018essential\u2019 apps pre installed. 20 really, but with the version from Sprint you also get the Sprint account manager (My Sprint) which is the only carrier app on the device to track usage, pay bills etc. It's nice to be able to load what I want and it I like not having to go in to setting to shut off notifications from OEM and carrier bloat. \nWhat else? A clean android experience. I\u2019ve never used a Pixel/Nexus, so I had no clue what \u2018stock\u2019 android was really supposed to be. Now I do. It\u2019s fast \u2013 blazing fast. Opening up the menu pull down from the top of the device is quick and not loaded with a trillion customization options. Sliding up from the bottom brings up the app tray snappy and fast too. I know, nowadays people love all the additional options, but that isn\u2019t what this device is really about. For example, my S8+ has 23 system options from the top pull down whereas the essential has 10 by default, and you know what? I really don\u2019t need more than that.\nOther options are still available in the settings menu for example the ability to turn on/off NFC, though anyone that uses NFC would probably argue they keep this on most of the time and not need to shut it off in a hurry.\nWhich by the way, if all that customization is important you can always go with a \u2018launcher\u2019 from the Play store rather than one that\u2019s forced upon you by a device manufacturer. I\u2019m just starting to understand that now. On the one hand you have the major custom ROMs by device manufactures and on the other (Nexus) a completely unblemished version of Android. Then there\u2019s the Essential which leans more towards stock, but adds just the right amount of personalization to make you feel like it\u2019s a unique experience.\nI do agree at times it\u2019s nice to have some of the manufacturer specific options and things we\u2019re used to seeing (like Touchwiz/Samsung Experience). I just hadn\u2019t realized what I gave up in Android responsiveness in order to have the manufacturer specific Android mods.\nI may have to test it out with a launcher at some stage just to see if it functions as fast as it feels now.\nThe default ringtone is nice and not obnoxious and I like the new unobtrusive text tone too. \nIt\u2019s all google messaging with the latest version as well as google keyboard and ability to text with GIF\u2019s etc.\nMy favorite feature so far? Home Screen Rotation! I haven\u2019t seen a handset where the home screen turns! Almost all handsets don\u2019t rotate the actual home screen, only the apps. I love the way the phone looks in landscape.Essential in Landscape on the Home Screen\nThe screen and colors are beautiful too. Granted I find it to be just slightly less bright than say the GS8+, but the colors seem to be more \u2018authentic\u2019 and realistic. By the way, for those reading\u2026 I think the S8 is an amazing device and I\u2019m not knocking it in any way. Really, up until now I\u2019ve been touting it as the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. We\u2019ll see how I feel about the Essential in the coming weeks to see if the \u2018new car smell\u2019 so to speak wears off and if I\u2019m back to my love affair with the S8.Call in Progress\nThe screen looks awesome when on a call. Simple, clean and bright. Personally I like the camera at the top of the screen, rather than an unusable bar taking up part of the screen. Looks great with websites too. Haven't done video yet... \nAdditional things \u2013 Activation was a breeze on Sprint.com with exception of one additional step. After activating the device I needed to go to the dial pad and enter *#*#72786#*#* in order to have the device reset with the network (took a min) and it downloaded a new MR to the latest software version.Not a bad idea to do that upon activation for those reading.\nThe Sprint network has been excellent on this device with full bars and quick loads of streaming audio and web pages. \nI\u2019ve made a couple of calls so far. Using the handset to my ear and using on speaker phone has been a pleasant experience. The speaker is loud and clear. I did use the adapter for the headset using the Samsung S8 earbuds and was told there was a lot of \u2018noise\u2019, but so far that was only two calls.\nThis is early days so I\u2019ll report back. So far I really really like this phone. It makes me happy. \nHave questions/thoughts about the Essential?

I too got into the S8+ and really liked it. I have 2 phones.. my personal 'S8+' and my work 'Essential'... but I'm tempted to swap them around as I use the personal one so much more and find myself wanting to use the Essential. \nIt's weird... as I can't say exactly what it is I find so nice about it other than how smooth it is and how nice the device feels in my hand. Sensitivity has been perfect. Swyping has been a dream and the way the fingers glide over the screen is like silk. Haptic Feedback for typing is dead on. Just the right amount of responsiveness. \nAll my apps are lightning fast... Spotify opens way quicker on my Essential than my S8+. Doing a side by side where I tapped the spotify link on the Essential a split second after tapping my S8 it still opened up first on the Essential. Tried the same thing with Audible, Uber, Amazon - check check check and Chrome - BIG win for the Essential opening Chrome. \nThat said, it could be the fact that I've been using the S8 for quite some time. If I factory reset it the results could potentially be a bit different. \nHave to admit though, I'm missing the always on display or tap to wake-up function. \nThe only software issues I've had are very occasional freezes where a web page won't scroll or move and an issue when clicking on an Android Central link from an email not opening up the Android Central App. Again, very occasional - has happened a couple of times and I can't recreate the issue on demand. \nThe only gripe I'd have is using a headset mic with the included USB C to headphone adapter.

[{"title": "The Gorgeous Essential PH - 1 ... Day 1 unboxed impression", "thread": [{"postID": "post6012447", "text": "The Gorgeous Essential PH - 1 Day 1 unboxed impression\nFirst, just want to mention I haven't even activated the device nor turned it on yet. This is literally my very first thoughts upon opening the box and hands on with the device.\nEverything about the Essential is executive and pure 'class' from the box to the accessories and of course to the handset itself.\nJust beautifully done. A few trees were probably hurt during the making of the box, but wow, what a presentation. (I'm kidding - I'm sure it's all from recycled material).\nObviously the first thing I did was pick up the handset. It's solid and heavy feeling, like the way things of high quality feel in the hand. Not like a new plastic toy, but like the old tonka trucks of back in the day made out of metal. This thing is built to last. It's no secret the Essential phone is made from Titanium and ceramic... and is sure does feel great. And talk about sex appeal. This phone is just beautiful and sleek/shiny. The 'Black Moon' one I received is just handsome and professional. The back is almost like a mirror, which you'll see in the pictures I took - reflections of the Galaxy S8+ and my hand included Smiley Wink. Which btw, I'll do some comparissons of the two in coming weeks... \nThe feel.. when I first picked the Essential Phone up I couldn't help but think about the very first iPod classic. It had that full premium solid feel. I guess I liken it to that in a way. In an era when most of the devices out there feel disposable, this one feels high quality.\nThe other goodies - high end braided cables. You can tell they thought all about the presentation when they put this whole package together. The USB C as well as the Headphone adaptor cable are braided and nice looking and a good sized charging adaptor capable of fast charge. (I've read it's the fastest charging device out there at the moment - really interested to see).\nAdditionally in the box is a pin to pop out the SD card slot and warranty/license information.\nThe bottom of the Essential Phone has the speaker, USB C Port , SIM/SD slot and a Mic (I'm guessing that's a pinhole Microphone).\nOn the mirrored Ceramic back you'll find the fingerprint scanner, 2 magnetic pins for connectible add-ons (like the 360 camera), a dual lense camera system and a flash. Note - ZERO branding, which keeps with the beauty of the device. \nThe top and left side of the phone have NO buttons and NO ports while the right has your volume rocker and your power button. Great options for one handed use, but will probably be a bit of a learning curve for many - having the power button on the same side.\nAnd that beautiful front of the phone has only a camera. Nothing else to take away from the aesthetics.\nThere's only one thing I can think of that could take away from all this beauty... I have a feeling this is going to be a finger print/smudge machine. I tend to carry a microfiber cloth, so hopefully that won't be an issue. I promise you, more to come after activation. \nI have extremely high hopes for this exclusive device! So far it's just beaufitul. \nHave questions/thoughts about the Essential PH-1?

I have gotten some nice pictures of my dogs. Again I don't really take a lot of pictures on any device. For a casual user I don't see much of an issue. \nThe screen is my favorite one on a phone, I have always been a fan of the LCD(I know eventually they will be a thing of the past)\nThe fact that I'm rocking the September security update in September, and not on a pixel or Nexus. \nI don't have any major issues plaguing my device, my over all experience has been rather pleasant. I have had a few minor annoyances but nothing that would make me want to get rid of this device. \nFor those wondering, I got my device via sprint on the 14th.

Carrier network, LTE, etc all work fine.\nI use a wide variety of apps (over 150 currently installed including what comes with the base Android setup)- all work fine. All the time. Using almost all of these regularly (half of them at least daily).

Essential has stated that more updates will be rolling out to fix the camera, however.\nPersonally, I\u2019m not really satisfied. Even though we can rightfully call Essential a startup (a billion dollar startup in that regard), many of the folks at Essential have tons of experience with smartphones and we even saw that blog post showing how they fine-tuned the algorithms for combining the standard and monochrome shot together for a better final photo. While I do acknowledge that it\u2019s no easy feat to combine photos like this, that blog post really did it no favors.\nSo where does leave us? If camera quality is not a concern, then the PH-1 is pretty darn good in other areas. If you need a good camera on a smartphone, however, I would wait for a bit and see how Essential fixes the issues over time. If you can\u2019t wait, however, the modified HDR+ Google Camera app seems to deliver better results.\nFor Essential\u2019s sake, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s fixed, because this sort of camera performance on a $700 phone is borderline laughable at launch", "time": "08-26-2017 07:22 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5939514", "text": "I'm not surprised, really.

For those who are in the game long enough, the advantage the Essential phone has over the Nexus One is better camera hardware. Essential, like Google back then, has zero camera experience. What people take for granted is how watching the Nexus line evolved camera wise showed how Google learned tough lessons and ended up with the Pixel's great camera.\nContrast with HMD, who in their \"Nokia\" phones is taking a similarly stock approach to software. Difference is, OZO and their eons of experience, which means HMD should be a leader in the camera space in Android within the next three years.\nIf Essential is smart, they need to constantly update the camera software and leverage their own partnerships.

If you make no shipment statement, you must have a reasonable basis for believing that you can ship within 30 days. That is why direct marketers sometimes call this the \"30-day Rule.\"\nIf, after taking the customer\u2019s order, you learn that you cannot ship within the time you stated or within 30 days, you must seek the customer\u2019s consent to the delayed shipment. If you cannot obtain the customer\u2019s consent to the delay -- either because it is not a situation in which you are permitted to treat the customer\u2019s silence as consent and the customer has not expressly consented to the delay, or because the customer has expressly refused to consent -- you must, without being asked, promptly refund all the money the customer paid you for the unshipped merchandise.https://www.ftc.gov/.../business-gui...-mail-internet...", "time": "08-25-2017 01:22 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5938398", "text": "Here is the linkhttps://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/busi...elephone-order", "time": "08-25-2017 01:28 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5938419", "text": "Everyone send this to Essential. Maybe we can get some results if we act together. See FTC rules below.\nWhat You Must Do If You Learn You Cannot Ship on Time\nWhen you learn that you cannot ship on time, you must decide whether you will ever be able to ship the order. If you decide that you cannot, you must promptly cancel the order and make a full refund.\nIf you decide you can ship the order later, you must seek the customer\u2019s consent to the delay. You may use whatever means you wish to do this -- such as the telephone, fax, mail, or email -- as long as you notify the customer of the delay reasonably quickly. The customer must have sufficient advance notification to make a meaningful decision to consent to the delay or cancel the order.\nSome businesses adopt internal deadlines that are earlier than those set by the Rule to ensure that their delay notices give all customers a meaningful opportunity to consent to the delay. If businesses fail to ship or give delay notifications by their internal deadlines, they automatically cancel the orders and make refunds.\nIn any event, no notification to the customer can take longer than the time you originally promised or, if no time was promised, 30 days.

I did sideload the Pixel camera app and actually prefer the stock camera although it does tend to over saturate bright colors a bit. No big deal for me.\nI have had no issues with the OS freezing, and any screen sensitivity issues are minimal at best. I think that many of the negative comments are more about the aggravation regarding the way the entire launch was handled, delivery issues, etc. I get it. I was frustrated as well but at $699 there is no way this phone should be getting trashed.\nTry it. Make an educated decision but don't base it at this point on everything you have read. \nJust my two cents for what it's worth..", "time": "09-05-2017 08:01 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5957031", "text": "I don't think anyone has a problem with the phone per se.

The phone is targeted towards pro-consumers and has all the bells and whistles when it comes to its internal specifications. With its stunning edge to edge display, the Essential Phone comes with one of the best displays in a smartphone.\nI just got my Essential phone delivered and below are my first impressions: \nEssential Phone is all about keeping things to the minimal - the essentials. You see this right from the moment you open the box. You get the bare essentials. \nYes, that means you have to make some compromises as well. Below are the Essential Phone Specifications:5.7\" QHD LTPS LCD Display4GB RAM128GB Storage3040 mAh BatteryAndroid 7.1.1\nAs you can see, the Essential Phone comes with top of the line specs though it lacks some essential, I mean, basic features that every other flagship smartphones come with:IP68 water and dust resistant ratingWireless ChargingHeadphone JackOIS support for the cameras\nThat said, you do get an innovative edge-to-edge full-screen display with no bezels and a Ceramic back panel with Titanium edges along the sides. This makes the Essential Phone stand out and breathes a new life into the smartphone design space.\nIf you are looking to find the Essential logo or any other text, then you will find none. The design is so simple and has no logos or whatsoever anywhere. Love it!\nThe Essential Phone's main camera features a dual lens, each 13 MP. Using this dual lens, Essential combines the output of both to create stunning monochrome photos. The front camera comes with a 8 MP selfie shooter. It is important to note that both the cameras lack OIS and provide only EIS.\nWith my brief time with the camera, I found my initial pictures good but will have to take more shots to see how capable the camera really is. Below are some sample shots.\nThe camera app, however, is poorly implemented. It is slow and there is few seconds delay when you switch modes or change settings. I did find the focus and shutter speed to be OK though.\nThe Essential Phone ships with Android 7.1.1 with no custom skin. This means you will experience Android in it's purest form - no extra features, no gimmicks - just the bare bones. There is literally no bloatware and the default setup comes with just the essential 24 apps and nothing else.  \nI enjoy minimalism and the Essential Phone is just that - a minimal design and software that provides a premium experience. In the next weeks, I will be publishing my detailed review of the Essential Phone here in the Community Reviews section and in my YouTube channel once I have used it extensively to see what it offers. \nIf you are interested in more tips and tricks videos and reviews, make sure you also subscribed to my YouTube channel.", "time": "09-01-2017 02:56 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5952972", "text": "thanks", "time": "09-02-2017 04:23 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5953635", "text": "Thanks.

Now of course we don't really know too much about the pixel 2 or the pixel XL 2 so a lot of this is obviously still speculation.\nWhat the essential phone will offer that the pixels won't offer is the attachment option, the phone is built with much stronger materials in ceramic and titanium it also seems like it'll be a cheaper option especially that it comes standard with 128 gigs and honestly I think it's a much better looking phone up to this point even if you were to compare to the first gen pixel.\nLet's also not forget how difficult it was for a lot of people to get a Pixel, It was sold out for months. Who really wants to go through That again?\nI was one of the big supporters of the pixel when it came out and to this day I think it's one of the best phones you can buy, I ended up selling it for the Galaxy S8 plus simply because it does have waterproofing and the option to do a memory card.\nWhat's your take and what are you going to do pixel 2 or the essential phone?", "time": "08-19-2017 02:47 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5928886", "text": "So I was waiting for the pixel 2 but after seeing enough leaked pics of the pixel I decide against it.

If you don't mind a bigger phone, assuming rumors represent the final product, the Pixel XL 2 seems like the way to go. If you don't mind a smaller phone, the same can be said about the smaller Pixel 2, with its now forgivable bezels (thanks to front firing speakers).

Unless you absolutely have to have a 360 camera attachment, this isn't a selling point. Also, leaving the consumers to use their imaginations to wonder what other attachments we might see in the future isn't a selling point either.\nI just can't think of the justification for spending more on an Essential over the OP5, unless maybe faster updates is really worth an extra $200 to you, and, in that case, I can't think of any justification to get an Essential over either Pixel, unless one is just too big and the other is too small. \nEven if that's the case, $700?", "time": "08-29-2017 02:46 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5944950", "text": "Your pricing is for the 32GB models.

Even if you don't like BT headphones, there's still the option to plug in the included adapter and plug your headphones into that. I don't know why some people are so against using the included adapter. At least it's included and you don't have to pay extra for it.\nThe screen size is larger than the iPhone 7 Plus, has a higher resolution and more ppi, and yet the overall size is smaller. And with those two pins on the back and the USB speed wireless transmission rate that is faster than BT, there are limitless possibilities for accessories.\nThis phone is for those people who are willing to take a chance on a relatively new company and a new product, yet still get a high end flagship type device that uses some unique materials and design features in its construction.", "time": "06-06-2017 09:25 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5842160", "text": "Cut the cord and step into the 2010's.

It has the latest processor and a lot of features that current phones don't have. It might be missing a few things, but you could say the same thing about almost every other phone on the market. They all have pros and cons, doesn't mean they're necessarily outdated. A lot of it depends on what you really want and what you really need in a phone.\nI've being weighing my options for a while now. I don't want a screen with rounded edges, so that eliminates the S8 and the OP5 for me. I need something that works on Verizon because it's the only reliable network in this area, which eliminates a lot of other phones. I'm not touching an iOS product. I need something with at least 128GB of memory unless it has an option for microSD card, so I can ditch my iPod. I would prefer the 835, but can settle for the 821. I only own one phone and it's getting worse by the day so the sooner I get something, the better. I don't think I can wait until October when the Pixel 2 comes out. So if I'm looking at what is currently available or what is supposed to come out within the next month, I'm pretty much limited to either the Essential phone, the LG G6 (G6+ is rumored for next month, but not confirmed for US) or the Google Pixel XL. I'm afraid to consider the Google Pixel XL knowing there's a new Pixel 2 and supposedly a slightly larger version coming out in a few months. It would just stick in my craw knowing that I could have waited just a few more months and gotten the next version. I've honestly never owned an LG or Google product so I don't know what to think of their build quality, but to be fair, I've never owned anything made by Essential either. Can't say I've ever heard anything bad about either though. An unlocked G6 direct from LG is the same price as the Essential phone and an unlocked Pixel XL with 128GB of memory direct from Google is about $170 more for some reason. Side by side by side, I prefer the looks of the Essential phone. I can even live with that cutout in the screen for the camera. Eventually all edge to edge displays will have them until someone can come up with a way for the camera to be behind the actual screen. I really like the fact the Essential phone has a titanium body. The accessories are also an interesting idea. IP68 rating would be nice, but it's not a deal breaker for me. I don't abuse my devices like that although accidents do happen. Updates are always an issue, but the Pixel XL gets them direct from Google whereas the Essential and LG would have some work to do since they're not entirely stock Android.\nAll that being said, I'm still no closer to a decision.

Tech outlets seem to like what it is while others don't seem to think so. \nPersonally, I'm not a big fan of it, for reasons which may seem obvious if you've followed me throughout the Android Central comments for the past few hours, but also another reason why I haven't made clear.\nNow, there are some reasons why I like this phone, but first, I need to make it clear why I'm not big on it.\nThe first reason is actually quite obvious; The display, or rather, a weird oddity that actually sticks out.You've probably heard it over and over again, which is probably because that's the first thing that comes out at you. Perhaps in the pursuit of a bezel-less design, someone thought to have a cut-out in the display so that it looks as if it's going around the front camera. Honestly, I think that's silly. I don't see the practical benefit of a design like this and I have a bad feeling that once you keep looking at it, it's very hard to unsee it, especially at night, where the display looks as if it lost a tooth.\nThe Essential PH-1 also lacks some stuff which may or may not ruffle some feathers, although some may argue that for a $700 phone, there's no excuse to why it isn't there. These include;Lack of rated water and dust-resistance. The phone may have some degree of resistance to both, but it has not been rated.Lack of a dedicated 3.5mm headphone jack, although the phone ships with an included adapter.\nDepending on which side of the fence you're on, you either find those a real bummer or a minor annoyance, but for the former, it's somewhat ironic that a phone created by a company called \"Essential\" is missing a few features which may be considered essential for a premium flagship.Of course, it's not all bad. Andy's phone actually has a number of high points, some of which include;A ceramic back with a titanium frame should make for a phone that's hard to scratch and also one that is more resilient to drops, provided that it's dropped on its corner.The dual camera array is pretty nifty, utilizing what Huawei does on the P10 and Mate 9, featuring a primary RGB sensor complemented by a secondary monochrome-only sensor without a Bayer RGB filter, resulting in increased sensitivity to light as well as lower noise and better dynamic range.The modular design seems pretty nifty for small accessories like the 360-degree camera along with other accessories.That 360-degree camera also looks nifty, being small enough to snap onto the phone's back while also giving the full perspective of a 360-degree cam.The Ocean Depths color actually looks slickIt packs the usual high-end internals you'd expect from a premier deviceIt runs a build of Android that's probably one of the closest to what Google ships on the Nexus/Pixel.However, let me rephrase that last point, and this is probably the biggest reason why I'm not currently sold on the PH-1 until sometime later down the road; Support. Essential is a new company, and it remains to be seen how their approach to software updates and customer support should issues arise are handled like. It's understandable to be optimistic as the company is founded by none other than the father of the Android platform, but it's probably best to remain cautiously optimistic as the old saying of past experience is not indicative of future performance has to be understood first, especially since as of the time of writing, Essential's support page looks like this;Of course, I hope it is indeed updated once the phone has a firm release date and is actually shipping towards customers.So what does this all mean? Do I hate the PH-1? Absolutely not. These are just my initial impressions and reactions (\"Eugh, what the heck happened to that display\" was pretty much mine at first glance, by the way) on the PH-1. Overall, I'm rather mixed on Andy's new baby as of right now. It has a lot of high points but also mixes those highs with some weird design oddities and decisions along with some unknowns which should be answered as the device nears consumer release. I hope the device does find some success in the enthusiast world so that perhaps Andy and his team can get feedback from those people and perhaps implement them in the PH-2.", "time": "05-30-2017 07:44 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5833631", "text": "Agree with some of this, I'm reserving judgement until we know more than just high level specs.", "time": "05-30-2017 07:48 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5833638", "text": "Support is the biggest question on my mind right now.\nAt $700, this is properly in premium territory.
