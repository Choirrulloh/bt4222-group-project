In saying this the P9lite has half as many features as the P20 so i have no doubt that the P20 will outdo the S8 and S9.... with regards to pricing and features. the main feature on the S8 that outdoes the P9 lite is the camera however the P20 outdoes the P9lite second to none with regards to camera. The interface of the Huawei is very user friendly and the phones come with the developer option which can be accessed on the S series but it is not a standard feature that shows up , you must know what you are doing to access this feature which i guess is to help avoid unwanted changes in terms of developer mode but if you know what you are doing then the Huawei offers a better developer option with more features.
