Actually, I kind of have two. I ordered it from Amazon on 1/10/18 and it said it was delivered to my front porch on 1/15 while I was at work. Got home, no Amazon box to be found. Since 1/15 was Martin Luther King day, I thought maybe a mistake had been made, so I waited until the following day, but still no Amazon package when I got home, so at this point I think my Amazon box must have been stolen by a porch pirate. I contacted Amazon and they promptly shipped out a replacement. I also called USPS and opened a case. Well, my local postmaster reached out to me the following day after looking into my claim. My local post office was closed on Martin Luther King, so my package had actually been delivered by an out-of-town USPS driver, and he delivered it to the wrong address (East instead of West). I was able to recover the original package , plus I got the replacement that Amazon shipped me. I contacted Amazon and asked if I could keep the original, and the said I could. So I got two phones for the price of one due to a USPS error.\nI gifted the first phone to my mother, and I'm using the other one. Mine has been rock-solid, I like it. Let me know if you have any specific questions.\nHowever... my mother's phone has completely stopped working in just over a month.

Regardless of the time period or setting, it still holds true. In this case, BLU\u2019s day has arrived, on the polished and fantastic powerhouse coattails of the VIVO X. The X moniker was introduced by the iPhone, and rumored for the upcoming Samsung, but today, it\u2019s here for the VIVO; and I happen to think it\u2019s quite fitting. The previous BLU flagship device, the VIVO 8, was good, but in retrospect it really didn\u2019t go far enough to separate itself from its own device lineups IMHO (in my honest opinion). However, all has changed and the mold has been smashed with the VIVO X!Pricing: The MSRP is $299, which is a steal of a deal for what the VIVO X brings to the table. Even more enticing is the limited time sale price of $199 (an amazing discount!), exclusively through Amazon. The VIVO X only comes in one color, which is Black. Specs:\n- An Octa-core MediaTek P25 Helio processor (and Mali GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 2.6ghz\n- 4GB of memory \n- a 6.0\u201d curved glass display made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 \n- HD+ Resolution (1440x720p) with an 18:9 wide screen viewing experience (268ppi)\n- A 4,000 mAh battery\n- 64GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n- A 13MP main camera with Sony IMX Processor & 5MP secondary shooter w/LED flash\n- A 20MP front-facing cameras and 8MP secondary selfie-shooter, with LED flash.\n- Runs Android 7.0 Nougat\n- Bonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)Overview and Performance: \nFirst and foremost, I want to say that this phone is a beast, which is an unprecedented jump in power, functionality and performance that I have not seen to-date, in a BLU phone. As I eluded to above, the VIVO 8 was a solid phone, but it just didn\u2019t jump out at me as a \u201cflagship\u201d device. Many of the specs and accents were there, but it just didn\u2019t have that \u201cflagship\u201d zip and wow factor; that all changes today with the VIVO X. When I first got the email on this device, I had to do a double-take because I didn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. Octa-core 2.6ghz processor, 4.000mAh battery, 6\u201d screen, and 4 cameras! If I said that out loud to a group of people, nobody would expect the follow up sentence to be \u201call of this is in the new BLU phone.\u201d So, without further ado, let\u2019s talk about it. Off the bat, the processor is phenomenal. I\u2019m not going to run out and buy a MediaTek t-shirt anytime soon, but the power and speed in the new Helio P25 processor is definitely noteworthy, and carries a level of production that I wouldn\u2019t have expected out of a MediaTek chip; job well done, MediaTek. The cameras are an absolute delight \u2013 which you can probably tell from my review video, which I spent a good bit of time showcasing the camera. The interface is on-point, the shutter speed is great and the capabilities are equally impressive. This is the BLU phone that finally earned a seat at the table of many of its esteemed colleagues, and has a couple of bragging points to drop on the table.Display: The screen size on this baby is a whopping 6\u201d, with an 80% screen to body ratio, a PPI of 268, and an eye-catching modified 2k resolution of 1440x720p, which they refer to as HD+. The dynamic is a bit curious, but they were able to squeeze it all into an 18:9 aspect ratio, which is the backbone of the elongated aspect ratio. The main benefit to the modified resolution is that it ties in high-definition resolution with stellar power management - the scaled down hi-res display consumes less power and allows the phone to crank out the graphics. The screen is made out of Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which is still my favorite iteration to-date. It\u2019s solid, scratch resistant, and works really well. All in all, the screen balance is great, and you can adjust the color temperature settings to your own individual preference. I think that BLU really hit a home run in creativity and design with this phone, and the screen really helps to showcase the effort that went into making such a great phone.Battery Life: I should have entitled this section \u201cbattery life for days\u201d, but I think that\u2019s mostly fitting with all BLU devices. If anyone were to try to say what niche that BLU has tapped into with their devices, it\u2019s battery power, and the VIVO X is no different. The VIVO X is sporting a massive 4,000mAh battery, which will last you well into day two, with moderate use. One of the great things that really helps to stretch the battery life out is the modified HD+ resolution. Typically, a 6\u201d screen with a 2k/4k phone resolution is going to burn through battery life because of the display size and amount of rendering that is required, but with the 2k/720p screen resolution combination, it helps to keep the power demands down, all while opening up the throttle on the processor to do things other than produce super high-res video that really, many people can\u2019t tell the difference anyway. The human eye cannot even tell a difference between 2k and 1080p until you get over the 5.3\u201d hurdle, so a 6\u201d screen at a modified 2k resolution still looks great. To put a modified resolution on context, the iPhone 8 only has a 750x1334 resolution, and it still looks good too.Fingerprint Sensor: While the FPS functionality of a phone may not be that important to a lot of people, I tend to think of it more as a \u201csleeper\u201d spec. It\u2019s not something that you really pay too much attention to at first glance, but it is something that can start to wear on your over time. Well, the VIVO X definitely won\u2019t be causing you any headache. I have tested a lot of fingerprint sensors throughout my time doing reviews, and I\u2019ve certainly reviewed a lot of BLU phones and I can tell you with absolute certainty that this is the best FPS BLU has ever used, and it\u2019s one of the fastest I\u2019ve ever used before. The fastest I believe is the Pixel 2, but the VIVO X is tied with the BlackBerry KeyONE, in my opinion. It\u2019s fast, and it works in a jiffy. I was very impressed with it, and I\u2019m sure you will be too.Sound: The sound is arguably the best that BLU has produced in a phone before. The VIVO 8 did do a really good job with its dual downward firing speakers, but the VIVO X gives it a run for its money, especially for a mono-speaker configuration. The speaker is much the same as the latest Samsung devices, with the speaker installed on the bottom-right side of the phone. It works and it produces solid sound. The only hang-up I have is that like most phones with speakers installed in this position, it\u2019s very easy to slide your hand over the speaker and muffle the sound. Other than that mild complaint, the speaker compliments the phone really well. Volume and clarity are top-notch for BLU, and of course, I\u2019m happy to report that BLU went ahead and threw in the 3.5mm headphone jack (score!)Camera: And now for something completely different\u2026 This phone has four cameras! Not two, not three, but four (4) cameras! So what does as phone with four cameras do exactly? Well, it takes tons of awesome pictures, and including wide-lens photographs for front-facing selfies, as well as with the rear-mounted primary shooters. The front-facing cameras are 20MP (f2.0 aperture) and 8MP, while the rear-facing cameras are 13MP (also an f2.0 aperture) and 5MP, and each respective pair works in tandem to help you catch some truly creative and epic pictures. The BLU Final Touch software on this device is the best I\u2019ve ever seen, and it shows on both sides of the lens. The coolest feature I think is the wide-lens photo mode, which is built into the camera app. Instead of taking a one-click wide-angle photo, you put it on wide-angle photo mode and hit the shutter button, and then the camera app instructs you to pan the camera to the left and right margins to envelop the whole viewing angle, which creates the wide-angle photo; it\u2019s really quite novel! In addition to the new wide-angle picture feature, the video recording department upped its game as well and incorporated a slow-mo video recording mode, which is fun to play with. Finally, making another appearance in the Final Touch software are all of the cool filter options and the \"beauty mode\" that allows you to fancy up your pictures for social media. All in all, the software suite is technical enough to create some high-class photographs without requiring technical expertise or difficult maneuvering to pull off. Simply put, the cameras are very capable, take great pictures and help even the most novice of photographers take some fantastic shots!Software: The VIVO X is running Android 7.0 Nougat, straight out of the box. This wasn\u2019t very surprising since all of BLU\u2019s new phones in the past 6 months or so have launched with Nougat. I do wish that they have went ahead and upped their game and launched the X with Oreo, but when you\u2019re living in a sub-$300 world, it\u2019s a nicety and not really an expectation. The version of Nougat the comes on the VIVO X is near-stock and very clean. For reasons unknown to me, BLU keeps bouncing back and forth with the UI features and locations of the quick-settings and notification menu. The VIVO X switched back to the same interface as the VIVO 8 and has the notifications drop-down on the top, and a swipe-up from the bottom pulls up the quick-settings menu. It works just fine and isn\u2019t an issue, but I\u2019d really like to see some consistency moving further into the year. The Google Assistant is just a right-swipe away, and is still a great addition to the OS. All in all, it runs smooth and isn\u2019t cluttered up with bloatware and other stuff, which has been a great step in the right direction for BLU throughout the past year. They have cut back on software suites and third-party apps, and really whittled everything down to a very near-stock experience, which I think is great!Conclusion: All in all, I thoroughly enjoy using the VIVO X, and it gets a very solid recommendation from me. The VIVO X is a massive powerhouse in the budget-tier sector, and even reaches up past many mid-tier offers from many other manufacturers. As I said in the beginning, this is a real breakout device for BLU and I really raises the bar for what we should expect from the VIVO flagship series in the future. This is not an incremental upgrade; it\u2019s a huge step forward for BLU and their VIVO series of devices. \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a VIVO X device, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 21 January, 2018, with exclusive pricing on Amazon while supplies last. The normal price is going to be $299, but during the sale, they are discounting it by $100, for a grant total of $199, which is one heck of a deal for what this phone brings to the table.

In all reality, it hasn\u2019t been a day\u2026 it\u2019s actually coming up on a year. I guess the old saying is true; time really does fly when you\u2019re having fun, and I\u2019ve been having a lot of fun with BLU devices this year. I\u2019ve reviewed the R1 Plus, the Vivo 8, Vivo 8L, S1, Life One X3, and now I\u2019m rounding out the collection with the R2 Plus. \nAfter reviewing so many BLU devices, I can\u2019t help but think to myself, is there a place for this phone in the consumer market? Well, I believe the answer to this question is \u201cyes\u201d. In a world of smartphones where we are constantly being spoon-fed type-cast, annual offerings by nearly every manufacturer, forcing us to choose between Option A and Option B, BLU helps make the decision a little bit more flavorful by offering Option C, D, E, F, G, and... you get the picture. In this day in age where smartphones are looking to break the next mold on ingenuity and gimmicks, BLU sticks to the tried-and-true methods of producing a reliable and affordable smartphone lineup that gets the job done, and checks off a lot of boxes for a wide range of people. Enter the BLU R2 Plus: Power and Performance, with a twist.Pricing: The MSRP is $179, but BLU has partnered with Amazon for an exclusive limited-time sale price of $129, which is a fantastic deal! The device is currently only available in Black.Specs:\n- An Octa-core MediaTek 6753 processor (and Mali T720 GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 1.3ghz\n- 3GB of memory \n- a 5.5\u201d curved display, with 1920x1080 HD resolution, made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (400ppi)\n- A 3,000 mAh battery\n- 32GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n- A 13MP f/2.0 aperture main camera with LED flash \u2013 records video at 1080p @30fps\n- A 13MP front-facing camera with LED flash \n- Runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box\n- Dual Sim & GSM Unlocked 4G LTE for use with ATT/TMO, and other MVNOs\n- Bonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)Overview and Performance: Many of the BLU phones that I have reviewed lately have been their higher\u2013end devices, which carry a higher cost and/or offer some more refined enhancements. In the R2 Plus, BLU has pared the device down a bit in some areas, trying to reach a balance between price and performance, which definitely shows. However, one thing I want to reflect on really quick is the idea of a mid-tier budget phone. When we think the phone spectrum, traditionally we have the flagship tier, mid-tier, and budget tier. Well, BLU breaks the mold with this device and brings us a whole new level of economy-phone citizenship, which I shall call the conscientious ownership tier. A lot of what has gone into this phone is maximizing the experience for the user, but keeping price low, which they have accomplished. If you are familiar with any of the recent BLU devices or my previous reviews, then the 1.3ghz Octacore Mediatek 6753 won\u2019t be much of a surprise to you. This has been the mainstay in many of BLU\u2019s devices this year, and it\u2019s a solid chipset. It cranks out enough power for multitasking, a little gaming, and all-around good performance for your day-to-day activities. Where BLU decided to keep things a bit more flashy is with the 5.5\u201d 1080p display, which is rocking a solid 400ppi density. The battery life is on-par with many mid-tier devices, and rounds out the package well. All in all, the phone works well and can handle pretty much anything you throw at it, within reason. The phone does have 3GB of RAM, which is ample, but don\u2019t expect to be doing any high-end gaming or heavy multi-tasking. You can load a very reasonable amount of apps without noticing any shuttering or system slowdown, but the best way to maximize the performance is to stay on top of your app management and close programs every once in a while. Display: Overall, I have been very impressed with the graphics. The screen is the same 5.5\u201d 1080p display that the flagship VIVO 8 carries, which is a nice addition to the spec spectrum on this phone. The color saturation is good and the overall balance of color and temperature are sharp as well. Of course, if you want to change things up a little you can go into the display settings and adjust the warmth to your individual preference. The color accuracy is also more on the natural side, versus the ever popular over-saturation technique that Samsung employs in their devices. I am happy that the blacks balance out well, especially considering it has an LCD screen. Generally LCD screens have more of a white-color effect that makes some of the colors look light and faded. Battery Life: The battery life on this phone is ample, and adequate. When paired up with other BLU devices that have 4,000mAh and 5,000mAh batteries, it seems like a radical shift in battery size. However, when you look around at the competition in the mid-tier range, and even the budget range, you\u2019ll find that 3,000mAh is actually really good, and more than competitive. Unfortunately the phone doesn\u2019t have the quick-charge technology that its predecessors have, but the battery is also much smaller which means that the recharge times naturally aren\u2019t terribly long. Even at 3,000mAh, when combined with the 1.3ghz processor, the battery should last you all day long unless you\u2019re a video streaming warrior. With normal use and mixed media, the phone lasted me all the way until the end of the day, which is perfectly fine in my book.Fingerprint Sensor: The Fingerprint Sensor (FPS) on the R2 Plus is accurate and works well, especially considering that we\u2019re dealing with a phone that costs between the $129-179 range, depending on when you buy it. However, you can tell that it\u2019s not quite up to par with some of the higher-end BLU devices. There is a little bit of a delay between the FPS activation and the screen turning on. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a programmed delay or it\u2019s just as fast as the FPS can work, but you will notice it if you\u2019re switching over from a higher end device. Is it the end of the world? Of course not; it\u2019s a $130 phone. I remember back when phones cost $500-600 dollars and didn\u2019t have fingerprint sensors, so the fact that here we are just a few years removed and you can get a phone for barely over a hundred bucks with bio-metrics in it is an all around win.  Sound: The sound on the R2 Plus is probably the biggest disappointment for me. Yes, it checks the boxes and sounds alright\u2026 but it\u2019s not great. If you\u2019re just into listening to casual music and playing games, then you probably won\u2019t care very much, but I can\u2019t really advocate for that type of listening experience. The size of the speaker is the real limiting factor in the whole package, along with it being mounted on the back. I have highlighted before that I actually like the placement of rear speakers like this, and the same is still true. For the size and quality of the speaker, this one is mounted in just the right spot to maximize its volume and clarity. As you hold the phone, you don\u2019t cover up the speaker like you do with traditional rear-mounted speakers. In addition, your hand makes for a natural reflective surface for the sound to bounce back forward towards you, enhancing the volume and listening experience. But, at the end of the day, the speaker is just too small and tries to push out too much volume. Vocals are tinny, and you get some of that cheap speaker reverb as the volume goes up, which is variable and contingent on the type of music or sound that you\u2019re listening to. Camera: The front and rear cameras on this phone are the same as the ones that are on the Life One X3, which are pretty darn good for an economy level, unlocked phone. Not only does the phone have a 13MP rear-facing primary shooter, it has a complimentary 13MP camera on the front for all of your selfie taking dreams come true; complete with LED flash on both. In addition to the impressive photographic hardware, BLU included complimentary software features and enhancements within the camera interface to help you get the perfect shot! It has quite a bit of built-in features, all at the tip of your fingers. While in the camera app, swiping left-to-right, or vice versa, will change camera modes, which include: Panoramic, Video, Camera, and Beauty Mode. Once inside the specific mode that you want to record or snap, all you have to do is swipe down from the top to get the options icon, which allows you to change the camera settings to your desired preferences, which includes HDR, Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), and much more!Software:  As is on par with most of the BLU phones released this year, the R2 Plus follows suit with Android 7.0 Nougat, straight out of the box. BLU has been very consistent this year with implementation of Android 7.0 across most of their new phone spectrum, which I think is great. Taking a second to address any diehard software junkie concerns, I know some people are starting to expect Oreo with new Android devices, but I want to place that into context. Oreo is still only on 0.5% of all devices and it\u2019s been out since August of 2017. We will get there. Nougat just finally almost passed the percentage of phones that are still running Lollipop \u2013 let that sink in for a minute. So, having said all of that, enjoy the 7.0 experience. It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s sharp and it\u2019s here to stay for a while \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty darn good! In a world where many of the previous flagships are just now rolling out Oreo, or Oreo Betas, I\u2019m perfectly fine with a $100 phone hitting the market with Nougat.\nSpeaking of Nougat, the User Interface (UI) on the R2 Plus is clean, and sharp. BLU decided to stick with the more mainstream approach of the S1 and keep things running a more traditional Nougat interface. With a quick swipe down from the top you can access the quick-options, notifications and settings, and swiping up no longer does anything. Swiping to the right will get you the Google Assistant, which is probably my favorite feature that BLU has implemented this year. The overall experience is really clean, and I like it. It\u2019s about as bare-bones as I\u2019ve seen on any phone that isn\u2019t sold by Google, and I think it goes a long way to adding some credibility to BLU, and their design choices. Other than a couple of standard app formalities on the front page (Google suite, Duo, FM Radio, etc\u2026), all of other apps are hidden away nicely in the app drawer and not taking of valuable screen real estate. Of course, you can clutter it up all you want once you get your hands on it, but I really appreciate the simplicity and lack of bloatware \u2013 A+ on the software side of the house!Conclusion: The phone is solid and does a really good job in balancing price with performance, which is hard to do when you\u2019re BLU. There are so many different phone offerings that sometimes things get a little blurred spec/model wise, but it\u2019s important to note that this mid-tier economy phone brings the best that BLU has to offer when it comes to display and resolution. In addition to screen real estate, it\u2019s backed by a great multitasking processor and a dynamic duo of cameras that will up your selfie game, and allow you to take all around good quality pictures. In many of BLU\u2019s phones, the compromises are made on either the resolution, power, or screen size. With the R2 Plus, you get all of the stuff that you want to provide a solid user experience, along with capable video specs. However, these come at a small price. The battery is smaller, the sound is \u201cmeh\u2019, and quick-charge didn\u2019t make the final cut. So, what I say here is that the choice is yours. I think that the phone checks plenty of boxes for many BLU fans that want the full-HD screen and don\u2019t mind giving up a 4,000mAh or 5,000mAh battery, in exchange for solid 24-hr performance and saving $50-100. So\u2026 the choice is yours! It\u2019s definitely worth a look, and it\u2019s definitely an upgrade over last year\u2019s R1 Plus. \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one the new BLU R2 Plus, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 25 January 2018, with exclusive limited-time pricing of $129,99, and a regular MSRP of $179.99.

If so, then check out the details on this fancy new device which just launched today on Amazon with a limited-time sale price of $149.99, while supplies last (normal MSRP will be $249.99).Specs: Here\u2019s the rundown on what\u2019s under the hood.\nSpecs:\n- An Octa-core MediaTek 6753 processor (and Mali T720 GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 1.3ghz\n- 3GB of memory \n- a 5.5\u201d curved display, with 1920x1080 HD resolution, made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (400ppi)\n- A 5,000 mAh battery!!!!! (this isn\u2019t a typo) \u2013 with QuickCharge\n- 32GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n- A 13MP f/2.2 aperture main camera with LED flash \u2013 records video at 1080p @30fps\n- A 13MP front-facing camera with LED flash \n- Runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box\n- GSM Unlocked 4G LTE for use with ATT/TMO, and other MVNOs\n- Bonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)Overview and Performance: This is my first time reviewing one of BLU\u2019s Life series devices, and my initial impressions are really good. The \u201clife\u201d moniker has real meaning for this device, especially when you look at the specs. The MediaTek 6753 is no new surprise, and I have laid out my comments on it before in my BLU VIVO 8L review, but for those of you haven\u2019t seen that review I\u2019ll give you the quick rundown. It\u2019s a very power efficient processor that handles multitasking well. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t have the prowess of a SnapDragon 8xx series processor, but for multi-tasking, casual usage and a little bit of gaming, it\u2019s just what the doctor ordered for balancing your daily use. One big selling point for me here is the winning combination of the MediaTek processor, combined with a 5,000mAh battery \u2013 yeah; this phone really has a 5,000mAh battery in it. This phone is built for the long haul. In fact, it\u2019s built for more than that. It\u2019s built for life, just like the name implies! This phone will get you through morning, noon and night, and then into the next day, well before your morning cup of coffee runs out. Pricing: As I briefly mentioned above, the MSRP is $249, but BLU has partnered with Amazon for an exclusive limited-time sale price of $149, which is an absolute steal of a deal! The device currently only comes in one color: Black.Display: Overall, I have been very impressed with the graphics. The screen is the same 5.5\u201d 1080p display that the flagship VIVO 8 carries, which is a nice addition to the spec spectrum in this phone. The color saturation is good and the overall balance of color and temperature are sharp as well. Of course, if you want to change things up a little you can go into the display settings and adjust the warmth to your individual preference. The color accuracy is also more on the natural side, versus the ever popular over-saturation technique that Samsung employs in their devices. I am happy that the blacks balance out well, especially considering it has an LCD screen. Generally LCD screens have more of a white-color effect that makes some of the colors look light and faded. Where the display really shines in this device is in longevity. The 1080p display combined with the power efficient processor and 5,000mAh battery will allow you to binge video, games, and YouTube, all day long. There are very little compromises you have to make with this phone, and I like it.Battery Life: The battery life on this phone is insane. It is really phenomenal \u2013 I can\u2019t describe it any other way. I thought that the VIVO 8 and 8L were amazing with their 4,000mAh batteries, but just when you think it can\u2019t get any better\u2026 BLU says \u201chold my beer.\u201d \u2013 or root beer, if you\u2019re under the age of 21. It is nearly impossible for me to kill this thing in one day, and I\u2019m on my phone all the time \u2013 which is an understatement itself. I don\u2019t do a lot of video watching, but my screen is usually on from sun up to sun down, and I was nowhere near worrying about running out of juice. BLU says the battery life is rated at two days of use, which is pretty spot-on for normal users. I\u2019m sure there are people out there who could kill this phone in a day if they really wanted to, but barring streaming 1080p video on Netflix for 24hrs straight, you\u2019ll be fine. And in the event that you are so excited about testing out the battery life that you burn the midnight oil and test it out into day two, the phone supports QuickCharge, so you can be back up and running again in no time. The phone also comes with a 5V/2A charger, which is still using USB 2.0 \u2013 I wish they would go ahead and change this soon, but it\u2019s not the end of the world.Fingerprint Sensor: The Fingerprint Sensor (FPS) on the Life One X3 works well. As I have mentioned before, I really prefer having the FPS on the front of the phone, and apparently BLU feels the same way. Even though the 8L changed things up a little bit, I\u2019m glad they had a change of heart with this phone and moved it back to the front. I really liked how the VIVO 8 FPS was also a home button, which could be pressed down to return to the home screen. The Life One X3 isn\u2019t a physical home button, as much as it is a soft home button. You can touch it to get back to the home screen, but it doesn\u2019t press in. The FPS is accurate and works well enough. The only time I had any complaints was when I went to unlock it from standby. Once or twice it would vibrate and not turn the screen on, but I only managed to get it to do this twice. Every other time it worked just fine. It also has a little bit of lag when opening from standby. It\u2019s not overly slow, but compared to my Pixel 2 that I carry as a daily driver, it\u2019s not quite on the same level. However, I have to temper this claim with the fact that the Pixel 2 cost me $649, and the Life One X3 is $149. You have to make some compromises on your expectations when you\u2019re comparing arguably the best android device on the market to a $150 phone. Sound: The sound on the phone is very good, and definitely better than many other phones off the shelf now-days, especially in this class of devices. The dual-speaker setup on the phone is very much akin to the VIVO 8, and it works well. I especially like the downward firing speakers because the sound bounces right off of your hands, which directs the sound toward you when you're holding it. The volume is great, and it puts out some pretty good sound in the mid, to high range. The bass isn\u2019t spectacular, but it works well for watching shows/movies and casual usage. Oh, and bonus\u2026. It has a 3.5mm jack, which also makes me a happy camper. I know we\u2019re on the doorstep of 2018 here but it still drives me crazy that many flagship devices these days are leaving the 3.5mm headphone jack in the dust. They seem to think that tossing a dongle in the box is an acceptable solution\u2026 I respectfully disagree, and shall continue to lament the slow death of the headphone jack. However, today is not that day because BLU rocks and allows us the ability to plug in our earphones, headphones and auxiliary cords, so we can get our audio straight from the tap. Camera: The camera on this phone is very similar to the 13MP camera that\u2019s in the VIVO 8 (F2.2 vs. F2.0), which is pretty darn good for an economy level, unlocked phone. However, this time around BLU doubled down on 13MP awesomeness and threw a 13MP front-facing camera in as well, with a handily paired LED flash as well \u2013 they spared no expense (RIP John Hammond). In addition to the impressive photographic hardware, BLU included tons of built-in features, all at the tip of your fingers. All you have to do is a quick swipe to the left while using the camera to access all of the enhancements and tons of other options to help you shoot the perfect picture. I have definitely been impressed with the camera suite, which is built into the camera and allows you to make adjustments on the fly and doesn\u2019t require an additional app to tweak the camera or add enhancements \u2013 very nice! The cameras definitely get the job done. The only hang-ups I have are the image stabilization and noise that you get when trying to snap pictures up close, or of moving objects. Noise you say\u2026 what\u2019s that? The noise I\u2019m referring to is the sharpness and clarity of the photographs. You\u2019ll still snag a decent image, but the focus can sometimes give away the low-price underpinnings behind the camera hardware. However, it\u2019s definitely not the end of the world, and once you get used to it you can learn how to take excellent pictures with this phone. Software: Ok\u2026 before I get too deep into the weeds about the software, I\u2019m going to go ahead and address the elephant in the room. For those of you who are in the know, or experienced the problem firsthand, there was a problem with an update for the Life One X2 recently (it was isolated to only that device). When the update was pushed out, if effectively \u201cbricked\u201d the device, meaning it couldn\u2019t be unlocked or used temporarily until BLU came up with a solution to the issue. This lasted about a week until BLU was able to figure out the problem and get people back on track with their devices. As hard as it is to remain neutral when it comes to opinions regarding the issue, I must place it all in context. This is not the Life One X2; it is the One X3. Additionally, the software issue was limited and did not affect everyone running the device, and BLU has subsequently fixed it. So\u2026 rejoice and be happy, for the X3 is here, fun and fancy free, and amazingly cheap for the awesome hardware that it has under the hood. Getting more into the details of the user experience, I am happy to report that the device comes with Android 7.0 Nougat. BLU has been spot on this year with their phone releases, shipping all of their latest devices out with Nougat. I know some people are still die hard OS upgrade fanatics and expect everything to come with Oreo straight out of the box this late in the year, but I want to place that into context. Oreo is still only on 0.5% of all devices, so simmer down. We will get there. Nougat just finally almost passed the percentage of phones that are still running Lollipop (26% vs. 23% ... Seriously\u2026 it's still behind Lollipop). So, enjoy the 7.0 experience. It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s sharp and it\u2019s here to stay for a while. \nMoving on... With the Life One X3, BLU decided to stick with the more mainstream approach of the S1 and keep things running a more traditional Nougat interface, using the swipe down from the top for quick-options, notifications and settings, and swipe up no longer does anything. The VIVO 8 and 8L changed things up for a short while with their counter intuitive swiping from the bottom for settings and all of that jazz, but now BLU seems to have decided to change everything back to normal, which I appreciate. Swiping to the right will still get you over to the handy-dandy Google Assistant, which I absolutely love. All in all, I enjoyed the software experience and I\u2019m glad that they adjusted the UI to bring back the pull-down quick settings menu, and kept the app drawer intact as well. The overall look and feel of the user-interface is clean, and looks almost stock. There isn\u2019t a lot of pre-loaded software and bloatware clogging up the home screen or the memory, which is a winner for me.Conclusion: All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed using the Life One X3, and I have no hesitation in recommending it. Whether you\u2019re looking for a great experience without the high price tag of many other devices, or you just want a solid backup phone to carry around with you, the Life One X3 is a capable phone that checks lots of boxes for a wide variety of people. The Life One X3 is a quality device that lives up to its name and is very competitive within the budget arena. In fact, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s even a step above much of the budget competition, with its golden crown made of 5,000 glorious milliamps, and sharp 5.5\u201d Full HD screen. It\u2019s really hard to go wrong with this device, and I think that anyone that purchases it will be very pleased.\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a Life One X3, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 14 December 2017, with exclusive limited-time pricing of $149,99, and a regular MSRP of $249.99 - here's the link: https://www.amazon.com/BLU-Life-One-X3-Smartphone/dp/B0784VB4JX/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1513224699&sr=8-2&keywords=blu+life+one+x3 So, if you\u2019re interested in picking one up, I doubly recommend that you snag one now while it\u2019s $100 off \u2013 you can\u2019t beat this deal with a stick!\nPlanning on picking up one of BLU\u2019s new Life One X3 phones?

In the past month and a half, BLU has launched the latest in their flagship series, the VIVO 8, then the VIVO 8L, and now, drumroll please\u2026 they are launching the brand spanking new BLU S1. One important thing I need to mention before I get into the bells and whistles of this device is that there is an exclusive, one-day sale on Amazon today (31 October, 2017) for a reduced price of $129.99, which is a $50 discount off the normal MSRP of $179.99. Specs:\n- An Octa-core MediaTek 6750 processor (and Mali T860 GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 1.5ghz\n- 2GB of memory \n- a 5.2\u201d curved display, with 720x1280 HD resolution, made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (282ppi)\n- A 2,800 mAh battery\n- 16GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n- A 13MP f/2.0 aperture main camera with LED flash\n- A 5MP front-facing camera (no LED flash this time)\n- Runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box\n- Dual-SIM device\n- Bonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)\n- GSM and CDMA Unlocked (only Sprint CDMA, not Verizon)Pricing: As I briefly mentioned above, the MSRP is $179.99, but BLU has partnered with Amazon for an exclusive one-day only sale price of $129.99, available on launch. The S1 comes in two different colors: Black and Gold.Overview and Performance: The overall performance of the phone is good, especially for the lower amount of RAM in this device. For 2017, the recurring theme for BLU specs has been at least 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but the S1 has made up for some of this with a boost in the processor speed to 1.5ghz. The biggest selling points for this phone are the CDMA capability for Sprint's network (sorry Verizon users\u2026 maybe you\u2019ll get some love in the future.), and the price-point. The S1 is a very inexpensive phone for what it brings to the table, especially at the introductory price of $129.99, but I still wish they could have found a way to cram in an extra GB of RAM. Regardless, this is BLUs first ever CMDA capable phone, and I feel like they are playing it a little conservative this one, balancing out performance but still incorporating some of their popular features, such as the fingerprint sensor, Android 7.0 Nougat, and a well-balanced processor to help draw people in. All of BLUs phones are GSM unlocked, but now they are branching out and trying to access an entirely new user base, which of course carries risks. Hopefully this device will be successful and will open the door for expanded CDMA availability in the future. In the past, Qualcomm has held a monopoly on CDMA supported chipsets which has limited the availability of products to consumers, but not anymore. This bold shift into the CDMA market by MediaTek, partnered with BLU, finally places more power of choice, and price, in the hands of the consumer. It will definitely be interesting to watch this develop further. Display: Overall, I have been very impressed with the graphics, especially considering the price of the phone. The color saturation and sharpness are very good for a 720p screen, and the brightness is above average as well \u2013 the graphics and visual presentation are on par with the VIVO 8L, and the S1 even has a very slight increase in ppi over it\u2019s sibling (282ppi vs. 277ppi). The implementation is solid. 5.2\u201d is the optimum display size for 1080p resolution, so dropping down to 720p is not as harmful to the resolution or user experience as it would be if the screen size were larger. As I used the device, the balance between the screen size and display ratio became very comfortable and I didn\u2019t really give it any extra thought after getting used to the device. Battery Life: The battery life on this phone is good, and balanced. The MediaTek 6750 is a very efficient chipset, but the boost to 1.5ghz naturally increases power consumption, which will drain the battery a little faster. One other thing to take into account is that the battery is only rated at 2,800mAh. I say \"only\" because this is a smaller battery than what we have seen in the last few BLU phones, but the S1 was built in a way to maximize the features and abilities that it has, giving you a quality experience at an affordable price-point, which it does very well. One slightly disappointing feature for the S1 is that it only comes with a 5V/1.5A charger, and does not feature quickcharge, but the battery is smaller so naturally it doesn\u2019t take as long to charge. Fingerprint Sensor: The Fingerprint Sensor (FPS) on the S1 works well, and I\u2019m glad they decided to move it back to the front of the phone and reintegrate it with the home button. The accuracy and speed of the FPS is on par with competitor devices and won\u2019t let you down. The S1 does appear to be slightly more forgiving with finger placement than the VIVO 8L, which seems to be attributable to the slightly wider ellipses style FPS on the front of the phone versus the circle-shaped FPS on the rear of the VIVO 8L, but this is largely an apples-to-oranges comparison and really, both of the sensors work well and are very reliable. Sound: The sound on the phone is good, and the volume is complimentary. The vocals are a bit tinny and overpower the rest of the sound spectrum, but that's fairly common with small, individual speakers. If you're a music buff then you probably won't be overly impressed, but it's good for watching TV shows and YouTube videos, and it certainly works with music as well, it just isn't the phones forte. Speaker placement and design on the S1 is a bit of a shift from their more recent devices. The speaker is a single, downward firing driver that is located on the bottom of the phone, versus the dual speakers of the VIVO 8, and the back-mounted speaker on the 8L. I am happy that they put it on the right side of the phone though and not the left, which makes it more difficult to cover up with your hand while you\u2019re holding it horizontally. I am also happy to report that the S1 still has the 3.5mm headphone jack intact, which means that you can continue to rock on with your traditional headphones/earphones, and auxiliary cords. I may be a bit of a dinosaur, but I refuse to let go of my headphone jack. They\u2019re going to have to pry this feature out of my cold dead hands before I finally move on to the world of completely wireless audio. Camera: The camera on this phone is the same 13MP camera but it is lacking the Sony imaging processor, which I am sure is a cost-cutting decision that had to be made to get the S1 in at such a low price. Another disappointing design change is that the S1 only has a 5MP front-facing selfie camera. Now, a 5MP selfie camera is still more than adequate and you really won\u2019t be able to tell too much of a difference on a 5.2\u201d 720p screen, but when you upload it to a computer or try to display it on a higher resolution screen, the differences between a 5MP camera and 16-20MP camera will become very apparent. I was very happy with the last two BLU devices in the VIVO series that really swung for the fences with their selfie cameras, so personally it\u2019s hard to be excited about the 5MP camera that they included in the S1. That being said, the important thing to remember here is a) this isn\u2019t a VIVO series phone, b) It\u2019s only $129.99 if you can catch it on sale, and c) it\u2019s CDMA compatible with Sprint. So, all-in-all, regardless of my feelings towards the selfie camera, the S1 is still very much a well-balanced phone and on par with the competition, especially in a sub-$200 phone world, but the camera definitely isn't the crown jewel of this device. Software: I am happy to report that the device comes with Android 7.0 Nougat, which is expected now with BLU devices. I know a lot of people are starting to expect new devices to have Android Oreo on them now, but\u2026 this is a $129 phone and there are hardly any phones with Oreo on them presently, so I don\u2019t think there's anything wrong with choosing to launch with Nougat. BLU decided to change things up a little and revert back to the traditional pull-down quick settings menu from the top, which is blended with the notifications, just like normal Android phones. They eliminated the swipe-up gesture for quick settings, which I can\u2019t say that I miss very much. One feature that I am happy that BLU carried over to the S1 is the swipe-right gesture for Google Assistant, which you can access simply by swiping right from the home screen, much like Bixby on the Samsung 8/Note devices. All in all, I enjoyed the software experience and I\u2019m glad that they adjusted the UI to bring back the pull-down quick settings menu, and kept the app drawer intact as well.Conclusion: The S1 is a very solid and efficient phone with a level of performance that will surprise you. I have been very happy with it and I think you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a much better phone for $129, especially one that is GSM and CDMA unlocked. It\u2019s more than adequate for day-to-day use, and it even allows for some casual gaming (to my surprise I tested out Super Mario Run, and it performed without a hiccup!) It also has a capable camera \u2013 just make sure you temper your expectations to the price and specs of the phone. Will it blow you out of the water in any particular area? No\u2026 but it will last you a full day and get the job done. Another great selling point for the phone is that if you\u2019re looking to pick one up and switch to Sprint, Sprint is currently offering a $200 gift card if you decide you want to bring your own device over to their network, and the BLU S1 is on the approved device list, which means that if you decide to pick one up and switch to Sprint, the phone will basically pay for itself. Even if you decide to purchase one and use it with AT&T or T-Mobile, it\u2019s still a fantastic deal, you just don\u2019t get a gift card.\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a S1 device, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 31 October 2017, with a one-day only sale price of $129.99 immediately available on launch. The normal price is going to be $179.99, but during the sale they are discounting it by $50, which is a fantastic deal. The sale officially ends Wednesday, November 1st at 11:59PM PST.\nAs always, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section.

The Vivo 8L is available today, the 24th of October 2017, and is available on Amazon for $199 MSRP, but you can grab one right now for $149. BLU is offering a limited-time only $50 discount, which makes the price of the phone much more appealing.Hands-On Review -\n \nThis is the third BLU device that I have reviewed, and each new model keeps getting better and better. Each iteration of their devices has improved on something, whether it\u2019s hardware, performance, quality control, and many other little areas that help to make the phones ship-shape, and enable them to deliver a consistent and reliable performance. The Vivo 8 is a well-made device and it has lots of appealing features that help set it aside from the competition, but the Vivo 8L takes that to another level in an entirely different price bracket. The Vivo 8L (the L stands for \u201clite\u201d) retains the flagship moniker \u201cVivo\u201d, but it trimmed a little around the belt and dropped the price, making an already affordable phone even more affordable. Where the trimming was done, there were carefully made decisions on hardware and implementation that really balanced out the device and make it run very well, and it looks sharp.Specs:\n- An Octa-core MediaTek 6753 processor (and Mali T720 GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 1.3ghz\n- 3GB of memory \n- a 5.3\u201d curved display, with 720x1280 HD resolution, made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (277ppi)\n- A 4,000 mAh battery\n- 32GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n- A 13MP f/2.0 aperture main camera with Sony IMX sensor and LED flash\n- A 20MP front-facing camera, with LED flash (fancy!)\n- Runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box\n- Bonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)\n- GSM UnlockedPricing: As I briefly mentioned above, the MSRP is $199, but BLU has partnered with Amazon for an exclusive limited-time sale price of $149. The device currently only comes in one color: Black.Overview and Performance:  The overall performance of the phone is solid. As soon as I fired up the Vivo 8L, I immediately started downloading a lot of my favorite apps and games to see how well they worked. I have to give a brief kudos here for the MediaTek 6753 processor, because I am very impressed with the performance, especially for a processor that\u2019s rated at 1.3ghz. The lower clock speed for this processor is part of the developmental strategy for the device though. The 1.3ghz processor, plus 3GB of RAM and a 720p display, is a combination for winning! The phone's battery life is rated for two days of use. I haven\u2019t tested that theory out yet because I always plug my phone in at night to ensure I have a full charge for the next day, but with mixed to moderate use, I can say that the device should last two days. You can\u2019t watch YouTube for 48hrs straight, but with normal, blended use, the battery life is fantastic! However, with this balanced package, the device does suffer on top-end speed and intensive multitasking, which is mostly limited by the RAM. With one or two apps open, the devices consistently hovers around 1.3-1.5GB of memory available, which fills up quickly. The best way I found to optimize performance is to actively manage what apps you have running in the background.Display: Overall, I have been very impressed with the graphics. The color saturation and sharpness are very good for a 720p screen, and the brightness is above average as well. I was initially disappointed when I opened the box and saw that it was only 720p, but the implementation is solid. 5.2\u201d is the optimum display size for 1080p resolution, so dropping down to 720p is not as harmful to the resolution or experience as it would be if the screen size were larger. As I used the device, the balance between the screen size and display ratio became very comfortable and I didn\u2019t really give it any extra thought after I started using the device. The additional benefit of the lower resolution is that it is less power consuming, which allows you to use your phone longer, and is less intensive on the processor!Battery Life: The battery life on this phone is phenomenal. The MediaTek 6753 is a very fuel efficient chipset. I\u2019ve hammered on the specs a few times already, in positive and negative ways, and the shiny ribbon that ties it all together is the battery life. This phone is built to last, and not only last, but give you a quality experience at the same time. Generally when a phone company is skimpy with specs, it\u2019s in the wrong areas and they end up sacrificing performance for aesthetics. However, when BLU decided to make the \u201clite\u201d version of the Vivo 8, they didn\u2019t skimp on performance, they balanced it. The battery life is great, and it\u2019s even further accented by the CPU and display ensemble that are paired well for performance, long life, and enjoyment! The phone also supports quick-charge and comes with a 5V/2A charger, which is still using USB 2.0.Fingerprint Sensor: The Fingerprint Sensor (FPS) on the Vivo 8L works well. Changing things up a little bit from the Vivo 8, BLU decided to position the FPS on the back of the phone this time, which is perfectly fine. The FPS is very responsive and doesn\u2019t have much of a delay when unlocking the phone. The only downside to the FPS is that it is slightly less forgiving than some other flagship phones that I have used, but again, I can\u2019t imagine many other devices that have a FPS for $149, much less one that works well. The accuracy and speed of the FPS isn\u2019t a problem. The only limiting factor is when it comes to partial prints and improper placement of the finger, which is more of an operator error issue than it is a function issue of the FPS, I\u2019ve just been spoiled by the iPhone and Note 8.Sound: The sound on the phone is very good, and the volume is pretty good as well. Another functional change for the Vivo 8L is that BLU decided to put their more traditional rear-firing speaker back on the device, which I am actually happy about. You will be able to see more of the reasons why I like it in my review video, but as I\u2019ve stated before in the BLU R1 HD review, the back-firing speaker works well because a) your hand doesn\u2019t cover it up when you\u2019re holding the device horizontally, and b) the speaker position takes advantage of the natural grip that you have on the phone and redirects the sound off your hand, helping reflect it back toward you for an enjoyable sound experience. Oh, and bonus\u2026. It has a 3.5mm jack, which also makes me a happy camper. This recent trend of no headphone jack and requiring a converter is for the birds, unless you are lucky enough to have Bluetooth everything for all your audio needs. If you\u2019re a person who still likes to jam out with your 2015/16 era headphones or uses an auxiliary cord, you will definitely appreciate that BLU held onto this feature in the Vivo 8L.Camera: The camera on this phone is the same 13MP camera and Sony imaging processor that\u2019s in the Vivo 8, which is pretty darn good for an economy level, unlocked phone. However, BLU decided to up their game even more with the Vivo 8L and bumped the front-facing selfie camera up to 20MP (yes\u2026 a 20MP selfie!) Also making an appearance on the Vivo 8L is the LED flash setup on the front-facing selfie camera, which allows you even more flexibility when trying to snap selfies in any environment. The interface incorporated the same gesture swiping for the camera interface as the Vivo 8, and went a step further and added tons of new features and camera modes, enabling you to take excellent photos in just about any climate or condition. One important thing that I\u2019d like to reinforce is that if you like filters, you are going to love this phone. BLU included tons of built-in features and filters straight into the camera interface, such as: professional mode, night time mode, slow motion, time-lapse, text recognition, HDR, and so much more. In fact, the camera natively defaults to HDR mode, which can be turned on/off, or left on Auto. I have definitely been impressed with the enhancements that were made to the camera suite, which is built into the camera this time and allows you to make adjustments on the fly and doesn\u2019t require an additional app to tweak the camera or add enhancements.Software: I am happy to report that the device comes with Android 7.0 Nougat, which was a welcome surprise, especially since other mainstream devices still don\u2019t have it. The inclusion of Android 7.0 in the Vivo 8 was a great step in the right direction, and it still works well for the 8L. I know a lot of people are starting to expect new devices to have Android Oreo on them now, but\u2026 this is a $149 phone and there are hardly any phones with Oreo on them presently, so I don\u2019t think there's anything wrong with choosing to launch with Nougat. BLU brought over many of the features and gestures from the Vivo 8, such as swiping from the bottom to get to the menu settings, and the top-down swipe is reserved for notifications only. The stock android experience isn\u2019t modified too much, but you will notice little enhancements or changes here and there. One feature that I really like on the Vivo 8L is that BLU incorporated Google Assistant into the interface, which you can access simply by swiping left from the home screen, much like Bixby on the Samsung 8/Note devices. Another feature that I like is you can unlock your phone with Google Assistant, simply by saying \u201cOk Google.\u201d Of course, it opens straight to Google Assistant, but I have found it helpful because I never really used Google Assistant before this phone. All in all, I think the software experience is improved over the Vivo 8, and I like the UI features that were added. It makes the phone feel almost like a cross between the iPhone and Android together, but it\u2019s done well \u2013 they even brought the app drawer back!Conclusion: All in all, the Vivo 8L is a fantastic phone. I have been very happy with it and I think that it\u2019s one heck of a catch for $149. It\u2019s more than adequate for day-to-day use, and it even allows for some moderate gaming, excellent pictures, and it\u2019s a great phone for someone who is heavily engaged in the social media scene. I have no hesitation in recommending this phone at all. The Vivo 8L is a great device that really balances price and performance, and is an excellent addition to the Vivo family. \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a Vivo 8L device, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 24 October 2017, with a limited-time sale price of $149 immediately available on launch. The normal price is going to be $199, but during the sale they are discounting it by $50, which is a fantastic deal.

In searching for help on finding it, the only suggestions I found involved using a replacement launcher. \nHas anyone done that? And if so, do you have a recommendation?

For example, I'd like to have one icon on the screen named \"Airlines\" and when I click on that icon, it presents the United, American, Delta, Southwest ... app icons. \nI read an instruction on like that described what I want to do - it said to drag one icon on to another, but moving one icon on top of another here just moves the \"bottom\" one out of the way, even on the \"pinched\" icon-arrangement screen. \n[Added later] I discovered that if I put an app icon in the \"apps drawer\" (the four icons that are present at the bottom of every desktop page) I'm able to drag other app icons on top of it to make the folder I was looking for.

Fresh out of the gate today is BLU\u2019s brand new flagship device, the Vivo 8. BLU stands for Bold Like Us, and this new iteration of the Vivo series is definitely bold. You may remember a previous review I did on the BLU R1 Plus, earlier in the year. I had a few hang ups with the previous device, but the Vivo 8 is in a class of its own among BLU\u2019s devices, and by far, it is their most competitive model to date. It\u2019s rocking a full 1080p display, 4GB of RAM, a fingerprint sensor built into the home screen (insert internal fist pump), and a flash on the front-facing selfie camera. Wanna learn more? Of course you do! Especially at the introductory price of $199, and a regular price of $299. Pricing: Pricing and Specs are usually the first things I look for, so I\u2019ll go ahead and share them with you. The MSRP is $299, but BLU has partnered with Amazon for an exclusive 48-hour sale, which means you can pick up one of these delightful phones for $199 USD, which is a great deal. The regular MSRP of $299 still makes the phone competitive, but not as attractive as the introductory offer. The Vivo 8 comes in two colors: black and gold.Specs:\n-\tAn Octa-core MediaTek P10 Helio processor (and Mali GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 2.0ghz\n-\t4GB of memory \n-\ta 5.5\u201d curved display, with 1920x1080 full-HD resolution, made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (401ppi)\n-\tA 4,010 mAh battery\n-\t64GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n-\tA 13MP main camera with Sony IMX sensor and LED flash\n-\tA 16MP \u201cSuper Selfie\u201d front-shooter, with LED flash (fancy!)\n-\tRuns Android 7.0 Nougat\n-\tBonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)Overview and Performance: \nHaving listed the price and specs, I think it\u2019s fairly reasonable that this device is something to be excited about. I have had the opportunity to spend some time with this device leading up to the launch date and I have to admit, in the beginning, I had a few apprehensions. First and foremost, it has a MediaTek processor in it, and Sony has given me a terrible taste in my mouth for these chipsets. However, after firing the phone up and playing around with it, a couple of things helped change my mind. First, it\u2019s not a Sony. Second, it\u2019s very affordable. Third, it performs very well, especially for day-to-day usage and some light multitasking (you can even go split-screen mode!). For the price and the expectations that I had, I was very pleased with the smoothness of the user interface and performance during normal app usage. I tested it out on a couple of games and it definitely doesn\u2019t have the straight-line speed of an 8xx series SnapDragon, but it\u2019s also not supposed to. The P10 chipset is on par with the SnapDragon 625 series, which I have used on a daily basis in my BlackBerry KEYOne, as well as my Moto G5 Plus. All of them handle processing on pretty much the same tangible and appreciable playing field, with their not-so-subtle compromises on graphics intense games. It definitely doesn\u2019t play War Robots or some more 3D intensive games very well, but touch and click style games work well \u2013 enter stage left, Boom Beach (yup. I\u2019m still playing it), and Alto. Display: Overall, I have been very impressed with the graphics. The color saturation is average, and the brightness is not disappointing. I have not been a huge fan of 1080p devices since UHD graphics came along, but that's mostly because I bounce around quite a bit in the higher-tier phone market where that is an expectation for me. 5.5\u201d is actually a good screen size for 1080p, because the difference isn\u2019t even noticeable to most people\u2019s eyes. I\u2019m not going to get into the science of it all, but 5.2\u201d is the optimum size for a 1080p screen, and 5.5\u201d isn\u2019t stretching the envelope; increased resolution isn\u2019t something that\u2019s a selling point to me in this price range, but a 4,010mAh battery most certainly is.Battery Life: The battery life on this phone is phenomenal. The P10 is a fairly fuel efficient chipset. I won\u2019t go out on a limb and say it\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d than the SD 625 - which it is directly competing with - but the massive battery more than makes up for any minute compromises that you may think you're giving up by choosing this device. The closest mainstream comparison phone to the Vivo 8 is the Moto G5 Plus, which boasts a 3,000mAh battery. Both devices even utilize USB 2.0, which is a little bit dated, but not outside the realm of acceptability. The battery charging capability of the Vivo 8 is also best-in-class for BLU phones, supporting its own iteration of QuickCharge, called \u201cSUPER CHARGE\u201d, which will get your phone completely recharged in just two hours \u2013 if you can manage to kill it in a day.Fingerprint Sensor: I am very happy that the Vivo 8 has incorporated a fingerprint sensor. When fingerprint sensors first came out, I hated them. They were slow, clumsy, and rarely worked on the first try. As they became more and more integrated into devices, I have found that I much prefer them to a pattern or pin passcode, and use them as my primary means of biometrics and security. I have never really cared for the fingerprint sensors that are mounted on the back of the phone. It seems like they\u2019re never in the right place - especially on the new Samsung devices\u2026 With the Vivo 8, all of my fingerprint sensor dreams have come true, because not only is it a FPS, it\u2019s also a home button! Yes, you can push down on it and get to the home screen (hooray). If you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m very happy about this, and it works well. Honestly, it took a bit of a learning curve for me to get used to it because of the industry standard, where fingerprint sensors don\u2019t\u2019 function as home buttons, so pressing down on it was unintuitive. Now that I\u2019m used to it, I\u2019m very happy with it and wish that more phone manufacturers adopted this feature.Sound: The sound on the phone is very good, and definitely better than many other phones off the shelf now-days, especially in this class of phone. The dual speaker setup on the phone is very much akin to the iPhone, and it works well. I especially like the downward firing speakers because the sound bounces right off of your hands, which directs the sound toward you when you're holding it. The volume is great, and it puts out some pretty good sound in the mid, to high range \u2013 the cello on the Game of Thrones intro sounds fantastic! The bass isn\u2019t spectacular, but it works well for watching shows/movies and casual usage. Oh, and bonus\u2026. It has a 3.5mm jack, which also makes me a happy camper. This recent trend of no headphone jack and requiring a converter is for the birds, unless you are lucky enough to have Bluetooth everything for all of your audio needs. If you\u2019re a person who still likes to jam out with your 2015/16 era headphones or uses an auxiliary cord, you will definitely appreciate that BLU held onto this feature in the Vivo 8.Camera: The camera on this phone is definitely good for taking casual photos, but it was built for selfies. One of the biggest selling points of this device is the fancy, and novel, LED flash setup on the front-facing selfie camera, which boasts an enormous 16MP camera, which happens to be larger than the 13MP rear camera, which is ok. It\u2019s not a bad camera, and BLU went out of their way in an effort to step up their game and included a Sony IMX sensor into the design. The interface has a few novel gestures, such as swiping down on the screen to flip between the front and rear camera, which I have grown to love. Ok, back to the selfie camera; if you like filters, you are going to love this phone. I am not much of a selfie taker, but you can do all sorts of fun and cool things like night shot mode, slimming (well, cause why not?), whitening, and smoothing. I didn\u2019t really find that any really helped my face look any better (funny, not funny), but they are cool if you feel like a little bit of photoshopping on the fly. There is also a built-in camera app called \u201cZ Camera\u201d, which allows you to get super fancy and put emoji\u2019s and stickers on your photo, create collages, do picture-in-picture (PIP) photos, and much more (like adding different hair colors and sculpted muscle bound enhancements to your photos that you\u2019ve always wanted at the touch of your fingertips) \u2013 you don\u2019t even have to burn calories in the process. However, I have to say this\u2026 it\u2019s full of ads and requires additional downloads within the app. On a bonus note, many of them are free.Software: I know there are some existing hang-ups with their software and some security concerns, which culminated in their phones being pulled down from Amazon briefly, not too long ago. However, they were quickly put back up for sale, and the security issues were qualified by informing the public that the software suite is no longer installed on newer devices, and only applied to previous generation phones. So\u2026 they\u2019re ok. I can\u2019t vouch for the security versus a BlackBerry, Samsung or Google device, but I can\u2019t say that about a lot of phones. I am happy to report that the device comes with Android 7.0 Nougat, which was a welcome surprise, especially since other mainstream devices still don\u2019t have it. The inclusion of Android 7.0 definitely went a long way with me in helping to legitimize the efforts of BLU to appeal to a more mainstream audience. It still has their own little enhancements to the UI, to include swiping from the bottom to get to the menu settings, and the top-down swipe is reserved for notifications only. The stock android experience isn\u2019t modified too much, but you will notice little enhancements or changes here and there. Conclusion: All in all, I thoroughly enjoy using the Vivo 8, and I have no hesitation in recommending it. The Vivo 8 is a quality device that anchors itself very well within the competition, especially at the introductory price point of $199. I would highly recommend getting one at $199, but I can also make a solid argument for purchasing one at $299. Of course, I can also debate other phones as well. That\u2019s one of the beauties of the mobile device industry. There are almost as many colors, shapes and sizes, as the day is long. We are mostly free to pick and choose our fancies among a wide spread of styles and manufacturers. However, if you\u2019re looking for a great value, with excellent performance and an even better price tag, check out the Vivo 8. \nNormally I do a Pro\u2019s and Cons list at the end of the review, but I was so positive in many of the areas of the phone that I feel like a better explanation of some of the features I didn\u2019t care for is in order. Things I don\u2019t like:\nThe buttons don\u2019t light up, so you have to remember which side of the phone is for \u201cback\u201d, and \u201cmenu\u201d. There are two little dots that represent where the buttons are, and unless I got a defective unit, they don\u2019t light up. \nThe curved edge display. It sounds nice on paper, but it\u2019s not really a selling point for this phone. The curve in the display is not very noticeable at all, unlike other manufacturers who has incorporated curved displays into their devices.\nThere is no app drawer. I really like app drawers (except for my brief romance with the EMUI setup on the Huawei P8 Lite I had a few years ago, which I really enjoyed). However, that season of my life is over and I have discovered that I am much happier with app drawers. I do not like my screen to be cluttered, and I am very deliberate in the way that I organized my icons. This was a turn off for me, but it\u2019s mostly preference, and not anything \u201cwrong\u201d with the phone.\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a Vivo 8 device, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 30 August 2017, with exclusive pricing on Amazon for 48-hours, starting Thursday, August 31st through 11:59pm EST, on the 1st of September.

The WiFi range does seem a tad lower than the range on my phone, the Galaxy S6 active, but not sure that's enough to complain about given the price of the phone.\nBiggest complaint, which comes from use of the phone with PGo, the GPS signal does seem to go in and out and sometimes the app has to be re-started. That could be the app and not the phone, but since he and my wife are playing simultaneously and her phone isn't have the issue, we want to blame the phone.

I already had a BLU Life Pure XL, so have been a BLU fan for a couple years. I've been a big phone user for awhile, and took the chance on this for the sake of having a smaller option when I need it. I got the 2/16 gb version and find it quite smooth and quick compared to more expensive phones. The ads are nothing and hardly noticeable most of the time. It has great signal strength, both cell and wifi, and usually has OK battery life. I use the battery saver mode most of the time, since it doesn't seem to impair the performance much and I am willing to make the trade-off in favor of battery life. I just got the \"band 12\" software update and though I'm an ATT Gophone customer right now, I have been with T-mobile in the past and if they improve their coverage for my rural area, I'd go back. Maybe band 12 will improve that issue. The reason I'm posting is because of a wierd battery behavior my R1 started to display as soon as the update the other day. After the update finished, I charged the phone most of the way to full and made a couple calls and then set it down. It dropped from 88% to 48% in like 10 minutes and showed the abrupt drop in the battery usage graph. I also noticed irregularities while plugged in. Sometimes I can plug in the charger and look in a half hour and the % is down rather than up. I also had it sit at 82% in the airport yesterday for nearly an hour while I was using it the whole time. That sort of thing would be great if it was consistant. I called the BLU support number today and they listened to what I told them and eventually said to do a 'hard reset'. I'm not in favor of that and will hold off in hopes of the ghost leaving the machine. Just wanted to let folks know the update may have a negative side effect where battery life is concerned.

The phone has been performing really well. I haven't noticed any lasting lag that a reboot won't fix. My daughter has installed and uninstalled several apps and it keeps chugging with no issues. So overall I'm really pleased with the phone and so is she.\nI did notice one issue that's more an annoyance than anything else. Thought I'd ask here since this is the liveliest R1 discussion I can find. For some reason the screen will randomly turn on. This happens whether it's charging or not. I originally thought it was just when it was charging because that's when I see the phone most. I would walk buy after it's been charging for a while and notice the screen was on. I figured it was just the phone letting us know it was fully charged but then I started noticing it would happen when it wasn't on the charger. When it's not on the charger the screen eventually turns off but if it's on the charger it continues to stay on. If I manually turn the screen off while it's charging it eventually does it again. If it IS just the phone saying it's fully charged then this makes some sense to me since it would go on when charged then start going down, then recharge again and repeat. Only problem is this doesn't explain why it does it when it's not charging. Has anyone else noticed this or something similar?

Following up from last year's R1 device, BLU has made some substantial improvements on the outside and under the hood, combining some quality new features and amazing battery life into the new R1 PLUS. Over the past few weeks, I have had the pleasure of working with BLU to do an in-depth review and test drive of the R1 PLUS. While this isn't the typical mainstream device such as the newly released LG G6, and Samsung S8/S8+, BLU takes a step in a different direction, making its own mark within the mobile device industry. BLU stands for Bold Like Us, and I feel like \"bold\" is a really good way to describe some of the features that are available in the R1 PLUS. Where most mainstream flagships will run you $500-800 USD, the BLU R1 PLUS breaks away from this and provides a quality unlocked device for $159.99. While it lacks a fingerprint scanner and biometrics, it makes up for this with a sharp 720p display on a 5.5\" IPS LCD, with subtle curves, dual-SIM support and a 4,000mAh battery - try killing it in one day. I dare you! Without further ado, let's dive deeper in to the R1 PLUS and what makes it a unique and affordable offering in the budget phone arena.Specs:On the Surface:\nOut of the box the R1 PLUS is running a pretty stock version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which is fairly standard for economy-tier devices. I did reach out and speak with BLU and they have informed me that 7.0 Nougat is planned for the device, but the date is not available yet. The interface appears unaltered, featuring the app drawer, as well as the pre-installed Google search bar. The traditional swipe-down gesture will get you to the notifications menu, with a second swipe pulling down the entire quick menu, and settings button. The R1 PLUS does come with Opera\u2019s browser installed as the default browser, but the device also comes with a complimentary Google folder, which already has Chrome installed. The R1 PLUS does support active wallpaper. I did give one or two of the default ones a try. They work, but they definitely aren\u2019t as smooth as I\u2019ve seen on higher performing devices. Also, daydream features are available \u2013 remember, daydream features will not show unless you allow the display to turn off on its own. If you manually turn off the display, the daydream features will not work. Last but not least, as is common with Amazon coupled device sales, the Amazon store app and a few other amazon apps, such as Amazon Video, Amazon Kindle, and Amazon Music, come pre-installed \u2013 one disappointing thing is that you cannot uninstall them if you want to. I am unsure whether the Best Buy variant will have the same apps pre-installed. Device Construction:\nBLU definitely pulled out a few stops in the design and crafting of this device! The device comes in one color, Gun Metal Grey. Out of the box, It\u2019s evident that BLU put extra time and effort into boosting the overall appearance of the phone, giving it a much more premium feel than its predecessor. The frame is solid and has a good weight to it, at 191g, and measuring 153 x 76.6 x 10.5mm. It's also constructed out of aircraft grade aluminum! The power button is conveniently located on the right-side of the phone, and the volume rocker is located just above it. Ease of access for the device buttons is quite nice, and the case that comes with the phone does not encumber the operation of them at all. The 3.5mm headphone jack is located on top of the phone, and the USB 2.0 power connector is on the bottom. Under the Hood:\nOne of the strongest selling points for the R1 PLUS is the massive 4,000mAh battery. With new 2017 flagship devices such as the HTC U Ultra sporting a 3000mAh battery, and the LG G6's 3300mAh battery, the R1 PLUS is far and away one of best offerings you can get for battery life, especially for a budget device. The R1 PLUS utilizes a MediaTek 6737 Quad-Core processor, clocked at 1.3GHZ, and it has a Mali-T720 GPU to handle the display. Over my time using the device, I found that it is quite capable of powering through most day-to-day activities, and even some moderate multi-tasking and gaming. I can't even compare it to upper-tier Systems-On-a-Chip (SoCs) because that wouldn't be fair; the R1 PLUS is in a different class entirely, and geared towards a different environment. However, the CPU is well-suited for performance and power management, lasting well over an entire day with the 4000mAh battery combination. Honestly, I think one of the strongest arguments for this phone was made by my 7-year-old son. I let him use the phone to play some games in the car while we were driving out of town, and afterward, he wanted to trade me his iPhone SE for the R1 PLUS, because \"the battery last so long.\" Another surprise offering in the R1 PLUS is an enormous 3GB of RAM. I'm sure a few people might get a laugh out of the usage of \"enormous\" for describing 3GB of RAM, but I have to put this in context. Where else are you going to find a notable phone manufacturer that sells a $150 phone that has not only a 4000mAh battery, but also sports 3GB of RAM? Good luck with that. BLU did a great job in my opinion, ensuring this phone is well-equipped with enough quality specs to be considered a solid, economical daily driver, and a more than ample back-up phone, for those of you who like to carry multiple devices. The R1 PLUS also raises the bar for budget conscious devices, with an included 32GB of storage space, which should be more than enough for everyday use and even moderate picture/video taking. However, it also supports MicroSD storage up to 64GB, in case you need extra space for larger videos or a library of hi-res photos. Display and Resolution:\nThe screen is a well-equipped 5.5\" HD curved glass display made from Gorilla Glass 3, with a 720x1280 (720p) display and 267ppi resolution. Is it 4k, or 1080p HD? No, it certainly isn't... but the trade-off here is a solid unlocked device that powers you through the day and then some, especially when it's tailored to support reasonable graphics, and performance. The curved aspect of the screen isn't functional like the more common curved displays of Samsung's flagship devices, but the subtle curve at the edge does allow for easier holding and enhances the form factor of the device; largely, its more aesthetic than anything, but a nice novelty for this tier of device. One nice surprise for me is that I found the display to be very reactive and accurate, especially when typing. I do more texting and typing than anything on my phone, and having the Gboard keyboard already installed, combined with a well-implemented key spread, really helped out with accuracy right out of the box. As I used the device, I really didn't pay too much attention to the fact that the resolution wasn't higher because that wasn't really my expectation going into it. Another aspect of the screen that really impressed me was the viewing resolution and crispness of the pictures that I took with the device. There is a little lag between clicking on the picture and full-res display, but the color balance and image sharpness are very enjoyable. The R1 PLUS also handled video playback well, including streaming media such as: YouTube, Netflix, and other video applications.Cameras:\nThe R1 PLUS has a 13MP f2.2 aperture main camera with built-in LED flash, and a 5MP front-facing camera. One of the bold moves that I was referring to is the front-facing flash that BLU has decided to install in the R1 PLUS. Not only does the camera take good selfies, but the flash brightens things up for low-light environments and really helps you showcase your pearly whites. The main camera also comes with a nice surprise. Even though the phone resolution only supports 720p, the video camera will record in full 1080P, at 30fps - this is a great feature if you're into uploading video or enjoy using your phone to shoot video clips. Overall, I was very happy with both cameras, and even impressed by the quality of the images, especially on the 720p screen. Here are some photos that I took with the device. I tried taking a bunch of pictures in different area and lighting locations to give a good spread of what the rear-facing camera is capable of. One of my favorite built-in enhancements is the availability to switch between the front-facing and rear-facing cameras by a simple swipe gesture. If you swipe down from the top part of the screen, it switches back and forth between the two cameras \u2013 it\u2019s very smooth and convenient.Speaker and Sound Quality:\nThe R1 PLUS breaks from one of the popular norms of 2016, and has chosen to locate the speaker on the back of the phone instead of installing a downward driving speaker (I'm quite happy about this). If you're a sound enthusiast or like to watch videos on your phone, the R1 PLUS is a real winner here because the natural placement of your hands on the phone acts as a directional support for the speaker, channeling it back around to the front, whereas downward facing speakers are very easy to cover up and get muffled when holding the phone. The overall volume of the speaker is pretty solid. The lows and highs are ample, but the mids do seem to be a little underrepresented as the volume goes up. You don't have any trouble hearing it, but the subtlety is noticeable at times. Depending on the quality of the sound output, highs can also be a bit tinny at times on full-volume. However, it doesn't detract from the overall experience of whatever you're listening to. HD audio sources really help to create clarity in whatever you're listening to. As far as call quality goes, the volume and clarity are perfectly good; I have no complaints at all, whether talking directly into the handset or using speaker phone.Headphone Jack:\nOne feature that should make a lot of people happy is that the R1 PLUS still has a 3.5mm headphone jack. 2016/2017 has brought us several devices already that no longer support the headphone jack, which is unfortunate. However, BLU understands that a lot of people in the world still love to use their headphones and don't want to use a converter or toss their old headphones out for Bluetooth compatible accessories just to listen to music/video - this is definitely a positive feature of the phone. On a different note, the R1 PLUS does not come with ear buds, you'll need to supply your own.Connectivity:\nThe R1 PLUS is designed and well-equipped for the U.S. Market, sporting a wide variety of 3G and 4G LTE bands: Most notably for T-Mobile and AT&T users - Bands 2, 4, 7, 12 and 17 - be aware that the device is unlocked, and will only operate on GSM networks. Also, as I noted above, the R1 PLUS is a dual-SIM phone, which allows you the capability of operating two different SIM cards in the device at the same time (this is a huge PLUS for a lot of business professionals and international travelers). Beyond cellular connection and data, the R1 PLUS also sports Bluetooth 4,0, of course Wi-Fi, and can be used as a wireless hotspot. Accessories:\nOne of the nice surprises you will get when you open the box is a screen protector, cleaning cloth and protective sleeve - I wish more manufacturers did this. My number one priority when I get a new device is to dress it down with a screen protector and case as quickly as possible. BLU's forethought in this area is much appreciated and helps to ensure that your shiny new phone is safe from the get-go. The included case and screen protector aren't LifeProof or Spigen quality, but they are more than adequate and will work for normal use, or as a stop-gap until you have a chance to order aftermarket accessories. The screen protector is a classic peel-and-stick, which offers quality screen protection. Additionally, the R1 PLUS comes with a standard USB charger and charging cable (it's USB v2.0; and is not quick-charge). Overall Performance: \nThe overall performance of the phone is pretty darn good, in most regards. If you\u2019re used to an octa-core processor with 4gb of RAM, you\u2019ll definitely be able to tell a difference. This is not a flagship level device, and it certainly isn\u2019t trying to compete with them. But, for most casual users, the appearance and operation of the phone will be a pleasant experience. For some more intensive programs it takes a second or so longer to load, but that is to be expected with a budget phone utilizing a quad-core processor \u2013 it\u2019s not a multi-tasking beast. The areas you will notice shuddering or slow-down is during loading phases and graphics rendering, whether that\u2019s loading an app or while transitioning between one app to another. Once the application is running, it runs fairly smooth. Also, one thing that I noted and brought to the attention of BLU, and the development team is the multi-touch interface sensitivity/execution on the screen. I did receive confirmation that the screen supports 5-point multi-touch, but if you try to use certain games or apps, you will notice that the multi-touch is below par. In some instances, it is frustrating, and inconsistent to pinch-and-zoom, which was a turn off for me. It did seem to work better for simple browser and picture operations, but in real-time environments and non-OS related applications, it seemed to have difficulty. I am unsure whether the inefficacy is software or hardware related. However, I will say that the model I received is running a copy of the OS from December of 2016, and I was not able to get confirmation on whether it was the final design model, so the quirks may have been worked out of it on the release device. This is a cautionary note if you plan on running certain apps or games that require multi-touch response, such as zooming or sustained screen pressing. On a positive note, it runs Fruit Ninja like a champ! See included image. Pros:\n-\tBattery Life\u2026 I can\u2019t say this enough\n-\tPrice \u2013 At $159, it\u2019s a good deal. For 24-hours at $109, it\u2019s a fantastic deal\n-\tSimple and efficient \u2013 works great out of the box, and surprises\n-\tPrice versus Power Ratio \u2013 What else in this class of phone is going to give you a quad-core processor, 3gb of RAM, and 32gb of storage space?\n-\tSurprisingly good camera, and interface! Cons:\n-\tTouch screen issues \u2013 not a problem for normal use, but can impact applications and advanced interaction\n-\tA little sluggish with some apps and games\n-\tNot full-HD \u2013 720p is adequate though, and on-par for price\n-\tCannot uninstall some pre-loaded apps\n-\tThe included screen protector is a nice gesture, but is a bit underwhelming and is a magnet for fingerprints. However, it does the job until you can get a higher quality or glass screen protector installed.Conclusion:\nAll in all, I was very impressed with the phone, especially considering the price point. Even if you live at the edge of the technological power curve, the R1 PLUS has many positive selling points which even higher-tier phones cannot offer, like true multi-day use and massive screen-on time. Sure, not everything is not top-notch, but at the entry market for this phone and the amount of financial investment required, you won\u2019t find many more capable phones in this price range, especially not one as notable as BLU. So\u2026 if you\u2019re looking for a cost-effective and efficient phone that lasts an entire day and hammers all of the basics, then this is your phone. If you\u2019re trying to stay one-step ahead of the competition and always chasing the latest and greatest in technology, then this probably isn\u2019t where you\u2019re looking in the first place. Recommendation:\nI give it an A+ for economy users, and a strong recommendation for normal phone users, especially during the 24-hour sale! It also performs well as a traveling media device, or as an inexpensive alternative for a backup, or a phone for your kids. It\u2019s really a versatile device that meets a lot of needs, and looks sharp at the same time. It may be an inexpensive phone, but the build quality and presentation are quite impressive.\nThe R1 PLUS, is available on both Amazon.com and BestBuy.com in Gun Metal Grey, at $159.99 unlocked. Customers can take advantage of a $50 Instant Rebate during an initial 24-hour promotion starting on April 29th, and pay just $109.99.

[{"title": "BLU Life One (2015) General Discussion", "thread": [{"postID": "post4593818", "text": "Hey all,\nI recently got a BLU Life One (2015) for my wife and I and, while I'm generally satisfied, there are few things that have me puzzled and wanting to discuss with other owners. I figured this would be a good place to connect. I'll start things off:\n-App crashing: I use BeyondPod to listen to podcasts and I've noticed, without fail, if I try to use Chrome, BeyondPod will close every time. From what I've found, this is a mechanism to free up needed RAM. Has anyone had similar issues? Have you found a work around? \n-General slowdown: Most of the time this phone feels snappy, with only a little slowdown here and there. For $99, the phone far exceeds my expectations. However, there will be times where the phone will slow to a crawl with no apparent reason for doing so. I've found that turning off automatic updates helps a lot because it lets you start the updates at a non-peak usage time.\n-Sound controls: Why would they hide these sliders under all the menus? There are apps/widgets to solve this problem but that's just one more thing running on a phone that isn't designed for multitasking.\nThese are a few of the points of frustration I have but I'll post more oddities and fixes as I use the phone more. I know there are other things but they aren't coming to me at the moment. \nDo you have the BLU Life One (2015)? Have you noticed anything worth mentioning?

The app isn't crashing at all, it's a memory leak in Android (4 and 5, supposedly fixed by 5.1.1). Your app isn't crashing at all, the problem is that whether you close apps manually or not, the system doesn't always liberate that memory and it remains occupied (hence the leak). When the phone runs out of memory, it drops apps from memory, like your podcast player. \nI only know because I tweeted at the BeyondPod devs and this is what they told me. Coincidentally, I had just bought Pocket Casts that day since I was tired of the app closing while I was using Google Maps on my Moto E LTE, and it keeps happening. The only way it won't drop the app is if I leave GMaps in the background and keep the podcast app open (sort-of workaround, but I can't see map directions then, I have to rely on audio).\nI just bought a Blu Life One X this weekend for the ridiculous $99 and I fully expect the problem to remain as it's 5.1 and not 5.1.1, but even then, having 2GB RAM should alleviate the dropping issue as long as Android liberates memory when I manually close apps.\nI hope this helps!", "time": "12-14-2015 08:12 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4595420", "text": "I was able to get 2 at the $99 price (now $150) My wife and I had s3's, Teens have Iphone 6's and galaxy S6.

But I have managed to keep the speed with the phone. First is the SD card. Unfortunately not all apps will transfer to it. However, in the settings/apps/ there is a scroll sideways. First one will show your \"downloads\", swipe right and then there's \"SD card\" another swipe shows what's \"running\" and the next swipe is \"All\". In the All section you can click on each app and a dialog box comes up showing Force Stop/Show Notifications/Uninstall and Clear Data. In there you can lighten the load of your phone by applying some of these. Uninstall is obvious but the default (check mark) beside Notifications is a huge deal. Anything you're not interested in can be unchecked but the app will still run perfectly (i.e. less intrusion coming your way). Clear Data can empty the trash can, so to speak, of areas you have viewed in firefox/chrome/app ads and so on. If you want to keep an app around but suspend it (i.e. purchased and don't want to use) you can \"force stop\" and it will add another swipe category to the right called \"Disabled\" which you can go into and enable at anytime.

Is there a way to turn that off? Huh how rude. Who needs that, ever!\n3. Why does the \"ok Google\" have to be at the top of every page.

The phone would then attempt to restart but would boot lock (initial white \"BLU: Bold Like Us\" screen alternates with blank blackness) until I plugged it into its charger, at which point it would perform an uneventful - and very quick - boot. Operation is, for the most part, perfectly normal when plugged in, except that Gmail will trigger the phone to shut down. Boot lock also occurs when I try to start the unplugged phone from a powered-off state.\nThe list of heavy-duty apps started with Facebook and rapidly grew to include Messenger, Gmail, and the camera. I uninstalled Facebook, but this did little to alleviate the problem. The problem has gotten worse over time, and now, depending on the phone's mood, it may stand for maybe 30 seconds of Messenger, or may instead trigger when I try to use the email app or even open any app after I pull it off the charger.

You can see that article at forums.androidcentral.com/blu-android-phones/616797-blu-life-one-android-5-lollipop-now-available-first-experiences-installation.html\nHowever, I've now done a hard wipe reset of the phone, which I've confirmed doesn't help, and identified the problem as a serious memory management issue. It seemed to be worth posting as a new article with a clearer title, so here it is:\nThere are major memory problems on the BLU Life One upgrade to Android 5.0.2 Lollipop BLU_X010Q_V09_L_GENERIC from Android 4.4.4 Kit Kat BLU_X010Q_V16_GENERIC or BLU_X010Q_V17_GENERIC. The following are the main symptoms:\nSYMPTOMS\n-----------------\n1. All Apps will always download to Internal Memory, even when Preferred install location is set to be Removable SD Card. These include all Apps that previously were just fine on SD cards. Sounds innocuous enough (just move it later, right? nope--read on!), but it's symptomatic of a much bigger problem.\n2. If an App is totally removed (deleted) from the phone, the space it occupied is NOT freed up in Internal memory. This is verified by Settings > Storage (Apps and Free space entries under Internal memory). Not even rebooting the phone clears this.\n3. If you move an App from Internal memory to the SD card (say, because of Problem (1) above), it will usually (but not always--see Problem 4 below) move fine. HOWEVER, similar to Problem (2) above, the space it used to occupy is NEVER freed up. Same symptoms as in Problem (2) above. (The App was indeed moved since the available memory on the SD card goes down by the correct amount corresponding to the size of the App.)\n4. Sometimes, Apps that you try to move to the SD card fail halfway through the move inexplicably (these are Apps that ARE designed for use on SD cards, and worked just fine on Android 4.4.4 from the SD card), with the cryptic message \"Couldn't move App\" and no further explanation. The App stays in Internal memory and continues to work from there. However, the space that it took up on the SD card in attempting the move is never recovered! For example, if I try to move a 100 MB app and the copy fails 80% of the way through, 80MB of the space on the SD card is lost (as shown in Settings > Storage for available space on SD card). And if I try to move it 10 times, it will fail 10 times, using up an ADDITIONAL 80MB of space on the SD card EACH TIME (800 MB total, in this example). So you have a similar \"permanent memory leak\" issue on the SD card as well, similar to that on Internal memory with Problems (1) through (3) above!\nIMPLICATIONS\n--------------------\nSo you have two huge problems here:\n1. You might as well not have an SD card for additional Apps. You can only EVER download a maximum of about 4 GB of Apps (what's left from 8 GB of internal memory after the OS and Cache files, etc.). There's no point moving it to the SD card, because even if the move works, the \"freed\" up space is never made available for further use.\n2. It's actually even worse, since even deleting an App will not free up space to make room for another App. So it's only he first 4 GB of Apps that you EVER download that you will have room for! And I don't know yet how App updates will further eat into this. Your only option to recover space after deleting an App is to do a Hard Factory reset to wipe out all Apps and user Data and start afresh to download a different set of Apps, but always witht he 4 GB total limit, regardless of any SD card you have.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n-----------------------------\n1. If you have a BLU Life One phone, do NOT accept the upgrade to Android Lollipop (5.0.2)!! Android 4.4.4 works just fine without any of these memory problems. Wait until BLU has fixed this. This cannot be a problem in the Android base code, since it's too obvious a problem to have been undetected, so it's clearly in BLU's port for at least this model (and possibly others, so I wouldn't do so for other model BLU phones either).\n2. If you already did the upgrade, you have one of two options available to you.\na. Confirm that you indeed have this problem and then call BLU Technical support. They will replace the phone under warranty without hassling you about it. Of course, you will be without your phone for several days at least. They claim that the replacement phone would have the old OS on it, but it wouldn't hurt to reconfirm this! Since, as of this writing, all Life One phones are less than 1 year old, they should all be under warranty.\nb. If you only use a few and stable set of Apps, you can use the phone in this semi-crippled mode anyway more or less normally. You should avoid updating your Apps unless absolutely necessary, so that more and more of your memory doesn't disappear from updates. At some point, BLU will release an update (would be at least weeks, I'd guess, since it doesn't sound like a simple fix, even once they acknowledge it and start working on it, which to this date they haven't). You can still use the SD card to hold videos, music, etc., so it's not like the SD card is useless--it's just useless for Apps.\nNo, you CANNOT downgrade back to the previous version of Android. BLU technical support explicitly stated that they have no system in place to provide a flashable image of the previous version to the user (to load over ADB or via the SD card), even though technically that should be possible. Only their own technicians can do that.\nI still like my BLU phone (well, under Android 4.4.4 anyway), but it appears that their port of Android 5 was done sloppily and with insufficient testing. And since the update was supposed to be available in July 2015, but was delayed till November 2015, they clearly had unanticipated problems, but unfortunately succumbed to the pressure to get it out anyway.", "time": "12-04-2015 01:43 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4873954", "text": "Welcome to Android Central, and thanks for that very helpful info!", "time": "12-04-2015 03:15 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4879156", "text": "I started the update yesterday, but have never gotten anything about the second part..

In my case, the prompt to download Part 2 was pretty much instantaneous as soon as the phone rebooted as part of the installation of Part 1. Also do note the Android version and Custom build version (in Settings > About device) that correspond to the FOUR software versions I've seen so far, so you can confirm that you have in fact upgraded to V18 (and not V17 which came out not so long ago but was still Android 4.4.4). I'll summarize them below.\nCustom build version/Android version:\n1. BLU_X010Q_V16_GENERIC/4.4.4: The version my phone came with when I bought it pretty much as soon as it came out (July 2015), so I assume the first version ever shipped.\n2. BLU_X010Q_V17_GENERIC/4.4.4: An update that presumably fixed some unspecified problems that came out about September 2015. I originally thought it was the Android 5.0 update and wasn't ready to install it yet, so I kept declining when it offered to install it for me (upon each reboot). Finally I did in November 2015, and discovered that it was still Android 4.4.4 and my phone behaved exactly the same before and after as far as I could tell.\n3. BLU_X010Q_V18_GENERIC/4.4.4: This is the one where the upgrade notice explicitly states that this is the update to Android Lollipop (5.0) and it is Part 1 of 2 of the upgrade. I am not 100% sure of the full custom build version name is exactly as I indicate, but upon completion of Part 1 of the upgrade, you do see this numbering (I am sure that it did have V18 in the name and it was still 4.4.4).\n4. BLU_X010Q_V09_L_GENERIC/5.0.2: This is what my phone currently shows upon completion of Part 2 of 2 of the Lollipop upgrade. I can also add for this version that the Kernel version is 3.10.49 (date 2015-11-16) and Build number is LRX22G (I didn't note these for the previous).\nRegarding their Custom build version numbering scheme, it appears to be as follows:\n- BLU is of course BLU :-)\n- X010Q is the code for the phone hardware (BLU Life One). Note that there are apparently TWO hardware versions of BLU Life One: X010Q and L120X (and no, this is not dependent on whether it's the XL model or not). I know this because when you enter your model number (Life One) on their support form, you are further prompted to enter a Part Number with exactly these two choices in the dropdown. I would guess that the L120X is probably the new 16 GB/2GB RAM version of the phone, but this is just speculation.\n- Vxx or Vyy_L (where xx=16,17,18) are the three KitKat 4.4.4 versions than seem to have been released for this phone, with 18 possibly being only the \"installer version\" intended only to load Lollipop. For Lollipop, it's Vyy_L, where yy starts from 09 (Android 5.0.2) for this model and is the one with the problems I've describe above.\n- GENERIC is a fixed string of apparently zero informational value :-)", "time": "12-08-2015 12:38 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4881117", "text": "Got a reply from BLU today to each of my points. Here is the summary:\n1. Problem with default installation location to SD card being ignored and always installing in internal memory.\nTheir reply, \"This is a known behavior expected for Qualcomm devices on Lollipop ... as seen with the latest 2015 Motorola and LG devices [as well].\"\nMy take: It may well be an architectural limitation of more Lollipop restrictions with apparently some hardware interaction--I cannot evaluate that claim but I have no reason to doubt it, even though a quick Google search didn't come up with any \"known behaviour\" type articles. Nonetheless, even if there's nothing that can be done about it, it's a real problem for 2 reasons: (a) It makes auto-update of Apps pretty-much useless if you have a lot of Apps on the SD card since after update, they will reappear on Internal memory at EVERY update, and you'll have to do garbage collecting every so often to keep your Internal memory from becoming full and getting \"Out of memory\" errors. (b) The process of installing to Internal memory and then moving to the SD card is NOT lossless! To give an example I just tried out, I just installed the MS Word Android App (97 MB, all App, no Data). When I checked memory before and after the install, the free Internal memory went down 0.10 GB as I would have expected. Then I move to the SD card and the free Internal memory goes back up by only 0.03 GB! I reboot but still no change. So this Internal memory leak problem is a real nuisance and pretty much eliminates any benefit of being able to have Apps run off the SD card.\n2. App deleted from Internal memory or moved to SD card does not recover the space it was occupying (alluded to in Item 1 above).\nTheir reply: \"We are unable to reproduce this miscalculation. Please provide a video showing us the issue you are experiencing.\" They also pointed out that, \"Please Keep in mind that with Android Lollipop you will begin to see the Insufficient storage error starting at 400-500MB rather that KitKat\u2019s 200MB limit.\"\nMy take: I did more experiments and it is indeed more subtle than I had originally reported (but still problematic). Recall that I had done a hard reset (wipe) on my phone after the software update and even reformatted my SD card, so these were not artifacts of the update. But indeed, when I tried again now and deleted a few Apps, I found that all the space DID come back (unlike in my original report). But I also know I hadn't imagined it when I first wrote about it. Moving Apps is clearer, however. Some Apps upon moving to the SD card will free up \"within rounding error\" (0.01 GB) the amount of the original space they took; others as in the Word example above, only 30%! I guess it's not as reproducible as I had seen earlier (I could have sworn that NONE of the space was being recovered with either a delete or a move), but it's not too hard to reproduce significant leakage as in the Word example above. It seems there are more complex interactions at play here. (And Lollipop's increased demand for free space doesn't help.)\n3. Even Apps that ARE permitted to be moved to the SD card sometimes fail inexplicably during the move.\nTheir reply: \"So far, this is only seen with Amazon apps since they are system installed apps and not installed through the Play Store by the user. If you would like you can uninstall the Amazon apps, reinstall them, and see if they can successfully move to the SD card. If the issue you are experiencing is not with Amazon apps then we need to know what app/s are unable to move to the SD card.\"\nMy take: Not true. It happened with any number of other Apps. I didn't make a list the first time, but I did reproduce it with Skype (repeatedly). I am not sure that it is necessarily a function of the App, though. It may well be a question of system state (it is not lack of memory for sure since there was tons on the SD card). BLU support does seem to want to know about this, though--they are not trying to deny the issue. [As an aside, indeed the Amazon Apps are the only two pre-installed Apps that CAN be deleted completely, but they were not the culprit here.]\nBut I'm seeing another related problem: On Lollipop, far more non-pre-installed Apps have the \"Move to SD Card\" option disabled than did on Kit Kat! E.g., Google Sheets and Google Docs and a large number of others than I just KNOW I had moved to the SD card under Kit Kat and they worked just fine there but now most have that option disabled on Lollipop. So yet more pressure on the limited and leaky Internal memory ... it really seems to be a mess on Lollipop ...\nMy current view:\n- The phone is a good phone and BLU's support was good and their responses credible (all the more so for the phones being budget phones, at least in price).\n- However, if I were to buy the phone today I would definitely (a) buy the 16 GB internal memory version with 2 GB RAM and not plan on having any Apps on the SD card (though quite frankly under Kit Kat I had no problems with that) and (b) definitely NOT update (I cannot in good conscience use the word \"upgrade\") to Lollipop! There are some minor bells and whistles in Lollipop (most of which you can get through 3rd-party Apps), but the problems that come with it are horrendous and absolutely not worth it.\n- My hunch is that all this is an Android issue and not a BLU issue. A lot of this memory management stuff has got to be so deep in the internals of the OS that I can't imagine any reasonable vendor wanting to meddle around with it.\nMy current plan? Struggle along with Lollipop until I am back in the US (am on an extended international trip) and can do the exchange in an efficient way (from a shipping and speed standpoint) to take them up on their offer to replace my phone with one that has Android 4.4.4 again. Once the warranty expires (or heck, perhaps before that--it was only $99 and I got it mostly to learn Android, coming from iOS!!) I will root the phone and play around with custom ROMs and the like, knowing I can go back to any version I like! :-)\nWill I go back to iOS? My, that is a personal question isn't it?! Would I even be permitted to admit it here if I were? :-)\nBut the answer is: \"Nah, this is way more fun!\"", "time": "12-08-2015 06:09 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4881168", "text": "I may have pressed download later when the prompt for the second part came up..

Can you point me to the group you're referring to with the specific FB URL? (I do see a lot of people clamoring for the Lollipop update, who don't seem to realize they are better off without it.)\nAs far as being able to install Apps on the SD card, as far as I can see, most posts on the subject seem to indicate that it can't be done on Kit Kat but can on Lollipop, and my experience with the BLU Life One was the opposite. Under KitKat 4.4.4 I had about 100 Apps, almost all of which were on the SD card other than the factory-installed ones and those that used widgets. Now on Lollipop 5.0.2, only an insignificantly small percentage of Apps show as being movable to the SD card, so I can have fewer than 1/2 the Apps I had originally on my phone.", "time": "12-09-2015 07:54 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4882169", "text": "I tried the update and I am stuck in recovery mode.

Combining this with other articles I've been reading on the Internet, I'd conclude the following (Kit Kat=Android 4.4.4, Lollipop=Android 5.0.2):\n1. On Lollipop, moving an App to the SD card only seems to move a portion of the App (given that there was no Data in the ~100MB space that this App occupied I'm not sure how the division works, but that's how it seems to).\n2. On Lollipop, many many Apps can no longer even be moved to the SD card (partially or otherwise), that could on Kit Kat.\n3. BLU Life One seemed to have a particularly liberal version of Kit Kat as far as moving Apps to SD was concerned, since many articles refer to other phones on Kit Kat not being able to move Apps to the SD card at all (without some sort of hack, which hack no longer works with Lollipop, basically \"pm set-install-location 2\" over the ADB interface WITHOUT rooting--see the excellent article at techgage.com/article/moving_your_non-movable_android_apps_to_an_sd_card/\n4. Lollipop seems to have increased restrictions on SD Card use by Apps (big brother being paternalistic again and protecting us from ourselves) and this may be related.\n5. You may need to have the SD card installed in the phone BEFORE you turn it on for the first time (if not, you will have to do a factory reset with the SD card installed) to use the ability to move Apps to the SD card (whatever little that ability may be).\n6. Bottom line: Stick with Kit Kat on BLU Life One if you have lots of Apps that will use up the 4 GB you have left on your Internal memory (note that many Apps, once they are opened for the first time, create huge amounts of Data that often cannot be anywhere other than Internal memory).\n7. On Lollipop, essentially the SD card is only good for data storage for certain Apps that allow it, although by default they will usually store data in Internal memory. On many versions of Kit Kat, that also seems to be true, although the version that came on the BLU Life One seemed much more liberal in this regard.\n8. To save Internal memory space, make sure that for Apps like mapping apps or Video or Photo apps, that you go into their settings before downloading any maps, video files, etc. (files that are especially large), find the option that controls where data files are stored, and change that to the SD card. Note that if you see the option for External Storage 0 or 1 (or External Storage 1 or 2) that you select the HIGHER numbered one. The lower-numbered one is often \"emulated SD storage\" that is actually really internal storage!\n9. For Lollipop, the only way to use the SD card for storing a large number of Apps seems to be to (a) root it (b) get a program like Link2SD (c) create a 2nd partition on your SD card using the EXT file system (d) link this 2nd partition using Link2SD so that Lollipop will allow its use for Apps. There are many articles on the internet on how this is done, but I haven't it this myself and besides it's outside the scope of this thread.\nI'll add to this thread if I learn anything more that's pertinent, but I think I've reached a level of understanding on what's going on (even though I don't like it). I've learned far more about Android than I was planning or expecting to in the last few days, so maybe that made it worth the hassle of being left with a downgraded phone after a supposed \"upgrade.\"", "time": "12-09-2015 09:18 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4882448", "text": "I went ahead and installed the update..

So far everything seems to be OK except battery charging (more on that later).\nAfter the update I also got the error message \"Not enough space to update Google Service\". At that time Storage showed about 400MB free space. The update download was about 900MB, and I found it under the app \"System Update\" (or something like that). After doing a Clear Data for that app I got enough space to update Google Service and a few other apps.\nI didn't quite encounter the problems TangoSmiles reported, but now that he mentioned it, it did seem weird that after clearing the update download, Storage only showed about 1GB free space rather than 1.3GB (i.e. 400MB+900MB).\nAnd a couple of more things about storage:\n1. I only use a handful apps on the phone and all of them are in the internal memory. That's probably why I didn't encounter any problem related to moving apps to/from SD.\n2. As TangoSmiles reported, some apps can store data on SD, but the storage calculation under Storage will count them. For example, although the internal memory is only 8GB, the Apps category alone on my phone is 8.3GB, plus 3.13GB for OS and so on. However, it does not appear to affect the calculation of the Available space, e.g. it still shows that I have 1.08GB available in the internal memory.\nI use Nova Launcher so the UI looks more or less the same before and after the update. So far all the apps that I used frequently seem to work fine. After the update the system self-rebooted a couple of times, and each time showing \"Optimizing apps ...\". After that the system is smooth and responsive. I haven't had time to play around but I like what I've seen so far about Lollipop.\nThe main problem I have after the update is battery charging. I've been using an Anker charging hub to charge the phone and it used to charge it even faster than the original phone charger. However, after the update I charged it for almost 10 hours and the battery level only went from 27% to 48%. I'll try the original charger today (if I can still find it).

Normally that zip has everything in it and a Qualcomm flash tool usually saved as QPST.2.7.425. The instructions are there. Make sure and this is important that you install Qualcomm drivers as well. And ofcourse disable any driver signing. I can tell you that I had two Blu Life Ones, one with the dreaded Lollipop upgrade which was always messing me up and the other was for a friend and the moment they clicked upgrade, the phone got stuck in recovery mode and no matter what you did, nothing worked. This is what saved me and I managed to downgrade back to Kitkat 4.4.4 which is what the BLU_X010Q_V17_GENERIC will install on the phone. Once the phone is detected (the port will show on top of the QPST tool once detected or it will ask you to select it if any is detected). The rest is selecting the files as shown in the instructions and once you click download, you are good to go.\nFor a bricked Blu life one, it may not immediately detect it especially since the phone has to be off. Connect the switched off phone while connected with a USB cable to the computer. Note this carefully: Connect while holding the Volume Up AND Volume Down Button plus the power button (All the three at once). When the Black and white Blu logo comes on, release the power button. It is okay if you have to do it over again because you will have some several reboots at some point but you might get it in a go. Basically pressing the Volume Up and Volume Down enters the phone to a lit black screen (It is what I got on my Blu Life One LTE 2015 model) and once you see that, release all and it should detect a port, i.e. the phone will be detected but remain off. That is when the Download button in the Qualcomm flasher will come active. \nIf you have selected the firehose image files and the loaded the XML files by the instructions,the flashing should work fine. \nOn a non-bricked phone, once drivers have been properly installed, it should be done much easier.\nMy instructions may not be the best but I know this forum helped me restore both these phones with some personal perseverance and I have learned a lot in this period so I thought I would share my experience, so please, just know that if Lollipop update messed you up, you can UNBRICK your phone very well and YES, you can even downgrade back to Kitkat 4.4.4 yourself by using this tool and the ROM mentioned. (Select Flat Build>>Choose the programmer path as shown in the instructions>>Search path will come automatically>>Load the specified XML files (usually it is rawprogramunsparse.xml and patch0.xml).\nRemember the key things: (Drivers should be properly installed, Disable any Driver signing on Windows 10 or 7 (for some reason Windows 8 is problematic), Windows 7 is more recommended for this if possible but I worked on 10 as well because I had 2 laptops. Windows 10 has that issue where it may silently just refuse to install a driver without letting you know if the driver is not signed. That's the major issue. Disable Driver signing totally and let your Windows display Test Mode in the right hand bottom corner. Safer that way when installing drivers. If any prompt comes up that requesting to install an unsigned driver, please select Install this driver anyway (because yes, you need it boy to unbrick that phone or just to run away from the dreaded update).", "time": "06-21-2016 05:51 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5274397", "text": "So, I am having similar problems with the BLU Life One XL (Build: BLU_X030Q_V10_L_Generic).

I have had a little time to use the blue version and thought I would share some quick thoughts on the phone.\nBoth phones we packed up nicely and the boxes where very easy to open. In the box was the phone, some headphones, a clear TPU case, the charger, and a screen protector. All of this is a great bonus and pretty much saves you some money.\nOut of the box on the first boot there was a small update that stated \"bug fixes\". I let it download and install, this took about 5 minutes. After the reboot, I finished setting up the phone and installed on my standard apps that I put on all my phones (71 to be exact). After getting it set up I synced it to my Garmin Vivo Fit 2 (yeah I just noticed that, my phone and fitness band share a name). Everything synced up just fine and went through without issue. Once the phone was all set up and ready to go it performed very well. I didn't notice any stutters or anything, colors looked really great. Personally I can't see the difference between a 1080P screen and this 720P screen. I am sure having a Super AMOLED helps it out a lot. \nOne issue I had with my Blu Life One X was when I had my watch synced with my phone and I was synced to my car streaming music. The connection to the car would stutter and then eventually my watch would disconnect and the stream to the speakers would start working OK. I did not have this issue with this phone and I am sure they already addressed the issue with the Blu Life One X by now. Streaming Google Play Music and running Waze at the same time worked very well, I didn't see any lags in the navigation when it was running.Call quality was really good, when my wife called me on the way home from work everything sounded very clear. Much better than a lot of higher end phones out there. My service is through Cricket / AT&T, data and everything works great with the service.Build quality is a little better than expected for a $149 phone. The phone has its glass front and plastic back that has plenty of grip vs being very slippery. The phone is also very light weight due to having plastic in the build. I personally don't care if a phone is plastic. 99% of the time I am going to put a case on it anyways. The volume and power butting feel just OK but aren't that bad. \nI have only had the phone for a little while but here are some things I noticed digging around in the settings.Auto-Reboot option in the settings. This was also in the Life One X and I thought was a pretty nice feature. You can basically schedule for your phone to turn off and then turn back on using a schedule.Super Screenshots. This basically gives you more than one option to take a screenshot. The first one to the left is the regular screenshot, the one in the middle called \"Long Screenshot\" is basically a scrolling screenshot in case you want to take a picture of an entire webpage from top to bottom. It's pretty nice, the only other phone that I know does this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. The one all the way to the right called \"Part Screenshots\" basically takes a regular screenshot then pulls up and adjustable box so you can capture only what you want.Display Network Speed, there are a lot of apps out there that do this but this is actually built in.Chameleon, this is basically an app that themes your phone for you. It uses your phones camera to capture colors and then apply them as a theme to certain areas of your phone. It basically changes the color of the top parts of some menus and the toggle buttons in the menus.Black Screen Gestures. These basically allow you to draw a symbol on the screen while the phone is off in order to launch a certain app. It is a pretty nifty feature that I have been playing with and come to like so far.\nThat is all for now, I will update the post as I have the phone a little longer and see how the performance is as my daily driver.

I'll need a couple weeks to evaluate how long battery lasts properly, but so far, it looks promising.\nThat's it for now, a quick initial impression at the past 12h with the phone. I hope it lasts until tomorrow night as the battery indicator suggests (although I doubt it, first charges are always weird). I'm traveling internationally on Monday and I'd like the phone to be on its 2nd charge so it's hopefully stabilized the battery duration. We'll see. \nQuestions or comments?

My Life One X tends to go down about 10% overnight, so that's quite an improvement. If you keep your phone on the table during the day, you'll also feel the battery benefit.

I will update here over the next few days on how it goes. So far:\n1) The phone build quality is very good. Its just like the videos and reviews out there say. Basically, looks like an IPhone. The screen is also very good. And while I know some reviews commented its too low, I think its fine combined with the AMOLED screen. However, don't expect the screen to look like a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus which costs $700 bucks. There is a small black border around the screen at all times (like the Honor 5X). Would have preferred this not to be the case---but I can live with it for $200 bucks.\n2) Ringtones. You will have to download or make your own. It comes with very few and once you change them its almost impossible to find the default ones from Blu again---I am still looking into this. <Resolved. There are ringtones. However there is an unusual way to assign them to Messages or Ringer. By default all your songs the phone are imported into the pool of Ringtones. And way at the bottom are a list of system ringtones. You need to select the tone and then tell it if its for Messages or Ringer><There are about 15-20 choices and are pretty decent sounding>. \n3) There is a blue, green, and red LED notification light at the top. Blue when charging, green when fully charged or a notification came in, and red when the battery is low. It is tiny and hidden. It helps when close to the phone but a bit to small to see from faraway for sure.\n4) APN settings. It comes with too many and Net 10 as the default. You will need to add your specific carrier's (mine is T-mobile) APN settings (there is an OTA update that comes up right away too but for now I did not install it and relied on manual settings). I deleted all the others that don't apply to me and rebooted my phone. (I later tested the OTA update and it worked perfectly).\n5) With 96 apps installed and a SIM card, so far the performance is as in review videos. Very good. \n6) Battery life outstanding. 5 hours on screen time with 20% left. No social media or gaming, mostly texts, few calls, lots of web surfing, youtube, hulu, music playing. By far the best battery life I have ever experienced----with power saver mode on. \n7) I was worried about 4G LTE on Tmobile not working well. However, once I had the APN set to Tmobile everything was as normal (compared to my Moto G 2015).\n8) There is some bloatware. I think around five programs...Opera, Theme Park, Blu Help, Chamelon, File Explorer. nothing major here. But it is bloat. \n9) The camera app is kinds of cool. It has more features than you would expect and more manual controls. I wish it had dual flash. Again the camera is decent and on par with my Moto G3----its not Samsung S6---but its not useless either. Outside with a steady hand and you are happy. Indoors with light happy. Low light not so happy. Ability to play with settings and the auto focus/leveler very happy. \nCamera app is very cool its got advanced setting I have never had before. It is hard to dedcribe but you can do way more with it than stock androud app...very useful enhanced features. This should be the standard app on all phones. You can beautify, make animated gifs, take HDR, apply gilters, it dtects your face and lets you ehiten terth, make faces thinner, has very fsst focus, too many things to say. Just impressive.\nOnly thing that seems to be missing is SLO MO in video recording. Unless I just cant find it?\n10) Bluetooth in the car works fine. Connected quick and downloaded my contacts with no problems. \n11) Call quality seems pretty good. On par with other phones I've used. On a busy street or via bluetooth I can hear people fine and they can hear me. I do miss Android 6 dialer a bit in terms of quick dials. I highly doubt Blu will update to Andoird 6 (Marshmallow) but I can live with it.\n12) It has one speaker at the bottom and it is loud and clear. Would be nice to have two but its fine to listen to music or speaker phone calls. \n13) Inserting the sim and sd card is a bit tricky. Once you get it in your fine but it take a little coordination. I always had two separate slots for each so maybe this is why I had more trouble on this phone. 14) ISSUE: At 15% battery if you installed a custom app drawer, it stops working! This means you lose access to your apps. I am still testing this but it happens using APEX Launcher. I think since the phone is designed to not have an app drawer when the battery gets low it treats it like its non-essential.  RESOLVED: After clicking the App Drawer icon. When it looks like nothing happened or apps are not displayed, simply swipe left to see the Apps (they slide in). Weird but it works.\n15) The metal housing won't stick to a magnet. So if you have a cell phone holder that uses a magnet it won't stick direct tot the body. \n16) There is only one key issue that I have found. It seems there is no eay to turn Power Management Battery Saver on or off. It is set always on and kicks in at 15% with no eay to adjust the %.\nSince this is a rebranded Gionee S6 by Blu, I checked Gionee manual and it has the option. So seems like a miss from Blu? Or they decided to keep it always on. The S6 comes with a System Manager app thst Blu doex not include I am wondering if finding and installing it could be a solution. 17) OK so this is my last entry. Verdict I am keeping the phone. There are only two minor issues for me:\n1. The battery saver at 15% can't be toggled or switched off---at least on my Gold version.\n2. The notification sound's volume can not be adjusted. Or at least when I made a custom sound and applied it to Messages/Notifications this turned out to be the case. So its either on or off. <Note: This is resolved. Its tied to the Ringer Volume> \n17) No issues on Win 10. Plugin via USB cord, and the phone automatically displays the drivers needed from the phone. Install and you can move files back and forth. Just nice and simple. \nWill stop updating now.", "time": "03-02-2016 07:00 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5027384", "text": "My thoughts exactly on the small black border around the screen.

What could it be?", "thread": [{"postID": "post4997373", "text": "Being a BLU fan, I have a BLU Neo 4.5. A few days ago, I had this really strange experience; I have my 64 GB external SD card inserted and my phone's storage setting detected it. 64GB. However, when I went to my file browser, it said that no contents were available and when I tried to move an app to the SD card, it said \"Could not move app.\" I rebooted the phone and perfect. I could do it. \nHowever, later, the apps no longer worked. Does anyone know any possible reason as to why this is happening? I'm running Android 4.2.2\nWhat I've Tried, My Guess & More Info\nMy guess is that I also used this same exact SD card on another phone, moving the same exact apps to it. Maybe formatting the SD will help? I already formatted my phone (factory reset) and so far, the file browser has not yet said that the SD card was empty.\nWhat do you think I should do next? Format the SD Card to be safe, or carry on as it seems to be okay after the device's factory reset? Usually, is something like this more hardware or software-related? From what I know, it's usually software-related.\nAlso, on a side-note, it says that the phone only supports a 32GB SD, but I have a 64GB inserted and it works just fine, seemingly. Could that also be it?", "time": "02-15-2016 05:49 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4997421", "text": "I think you could format the SD card just to test it if that does not work try and see if you can test it in another device.", "time": "02-15-2016 06:44 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Just got a new Life One X", "thread": [{"postID": "post4996638", "text": "I was looking for an inexpensive \"mid ranger\", I had an HTC One M7 (Google Edition), then it died so I was using a cheap Lumia 640 on Windows but decided to jump back to Android.\nOnly had the Blu for a couple of days, but I'm pretty impressed. It's really thin and the \"leather\" like back helps the grip, much more than my super-slippery Lumia 640.\nI put it on the included charger as soon as I opened the box, I don't know how much of a charge it started with but it took about 2 hours to bring it up to full.\nIt then took me another couple of hours to get all my apps installed, get all the Google stuff set up and get it configured to my liking. \nCouple of things, the screen is pretty incredible, I compared it side-by-side with my HTC One M7 and the Blu screen is definitely better, very sharp, the higher quality photos look almost 3D because they're so sharp. \nThe color rendition is outstanding in my opinion, I have zero complaints about the screen, I'm not sure how any phone could have one better. Also, the screen can be made very bright, brighter than any other cell phone I've ever used. The auto dimmer works very well, I hardly notice it but the screen is always at \"just right\" brightness.\nThe Blu is also fast enough, it's a bit faster than the HTC One, just a little of the typical Android stumble as I scroll through long web pages.\nThere's hardly any junk or bloatware at all on it, seems very stock Android 5.1 to me. There's the Blu launcher or I downloaded the Google launcher, actually the Blu works better but you don't get the Google Now page or whatever they call it when you swipe right.\nAlso, the phone is very thin, I'm surprised at how thin it is. This one weighs 142 grams with a 64GB microSD card installed. I also didn't realize, this is a dual SIM phone, I never needed that feature but it's there.\nThe touchscreen seemed sensitive but there's a setting for low, med and high and I changed it to medium and it seems better. \nThe phone is also very easy to hold in one hand, although I'm not a good one-hander anyway with phones.\nSpeaker is in the back, the volume doesn't go as high as I'd like and conversations are a bit muddy, which is a disappointment. But people on the other end say it sounds fine.\nBattery life seems a little disappointing so far, I can actually watch it decrease in 1% increments as I sit there with it. I uninstalled Facebook app and also the dumb Google Inbox, both of which are said to eat battery life, so we'll see. The Lumia 640 had unreal battery life, literally days.\nI also uninstalled the home screen wallpaper and am just using pure black. I'll keep an eye on battery life, maybe I'm just not used to Android battery life because it's been a while (although I use an Nvidia Shield K1 and Asus MeMo Pad 8 tablet every day).\nNot sure what else to add, I don't like huge phones and the Blu screen is about 5 mm taller than the HTC One, but I could probably go a little bigger both height and width next time.\nI am absolutely not a fan of expensive phones, the technology changes and evolves so fast that it doesn't make sense to me to spend a lot, plus the action nowadays is in the low/mid range, there are some fantastic phones out there that are way better than high end phones of just a couple of years ago -- like my HTC One M7, which was like a $625.00 phone when Google first released it.\nAnyway, if anyone has questions I can answer, let me know. So far, very much liking the Blu Life One X, definitely a steal at its list price of $149.00.\nEDIT: Also, it received an update from Blu the second time I turned on the phone. The only thing I notice is that sometimes if I go to move an icon, the phone won't take a long press, it immediately opens the icon. But if I open some other app, then close it and go back to the home screen, the long press then allows me to move the icon. Not sure what's up with that, I'll keep an eye on it.\nUPDATE: It's now been about a week of hard use, I'm really liking this phone. The screen is incredible, really, the best phone screen I've used. I used the settings to tweak the screen a bit, making the colors slightly more vivid. Text and photos are extremely sharp, really nice.\nI also deleted a couple of apps -- like Android Central -- and use the mobile websites instead, and that really helps battery life. I also changed the battery display to remove the percent and only show the battery icon. I discovered I was too focused on watching the percentage numbers, which change and make it seem like the battery is draining way faster than it really is. But removing the apps and using mobile web definitely helps.\nI'm trying to use the \"Smart Lock\" system, where you can set it to not require a password when you're at home or a specific location. But it seems inconsistent; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. It seems to depend on where I swipe on the screen. Haven't quite mastered this yet. It also lets you set a trusted Bluetooth device as a \"companion\" to allow password-free login. Haven't tried that.\nI bought a phone blocking app that works fine, after getting some spam nuisance calls. On my Windows phone, blocking is built into the system, really easy to use and I missed that. I also downloaded Google's new texting app (I can never remember the names of these things) and it's ok, but not as good as the built-in texting app in the Windows phone. Oh well...\nThe one thing really and only thing so far that bugs me is the speaker. I like to use the phone on speaker and the speaker on this one sounds muddled, I have a hard time understanding what the other person is saying. That's ridiculous, considering the tiny 2 mm single hole on my Lumia 640 had much better and clearer sound. There's a much wider horizontal opening on the back of the Life One X so the speaker should be much better. BLU needs to work on that and then they'd have pretty much perfection.\nOnly one other thing, the phone seems just a touch narrow and long, which is OK for one-handers I guess (I'm a two-fister) and I thought I didn't want anything bigger, but now that I see this great screen, I wish the phone was larger, maybe a 5.5\".\nAlso, the phone is incredibly thin, every time I pick it up I'm amazed at how thin it is. They did a great job on that. The fake leather plastic back also gives a pretty good grip; could be better but it's OK, much better than the slippery bar of soap that is the Lumia 640.\nWill report back if I learn anything new.\nUPDATE 2: OK, couple of weeks now, still really liking everything about this phone EXCEPT: the speakers. The sound is really muffled, I have a hard time hearing what people are saying, whether I'm on the speaker or ear speaker. Plus, the volume just doesn't go high enough.\nI've tried it with and without the sound clarifying feature on and off and it's maybe a tiny bit better with it off. This is really the most disappointing aspect of this phone, so much so that it's probably going to drive me to find another brand. \nI mean, how hard is it nowadays to include a half-way decent speaker so you can hear a phone conversation? I have to get everyone to repeat about every other sentence, it's really bad. I'm a big fan of cheap phones, but this is a big issue for me. Hope I can hold out until the Alcatel Idol 4 comes out, that seems interesting, it has dual speakers -- rare on phones today.\nUPDATE 3: OK, final post. I'm returning this to Amazon, I just can't live with the sound quality. I'm not a fussy guy by any means, but this is so bad I can't hear people talk, it's very muffled sound through the speaker and ear speaker. So I figured I'd take advantage of Amazon's return policy. \nI didn't want to spend the money, but ordered a Motorola Moto X Pure Edition instead, very sorry the BLU phone didn't work out for me because I like everything about it but the sound.\nJust for kicks, I threw my SIM in my old $59.00 Lumia 640 (last time I looked, they're $29.88 at Walmart now) and the sound is like 5 times better. Very clear through the loudspeaker or ear speaker, no problems at all. So if I can get a good speaker through the tiny hole in the 640 for $59.00, BLU really blew it (!) with their terrible speaker in the Life One X.", "time": "02-14-2016 02:29 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "How do I replace the glass on a Blu Dash 5.5 phone?", "thread": [{"postID": "post4989497", "text": "I have removed everything but can't see how to remove the old glass", "time": "02-09-2016 10:04 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4995282", "text": "You probably need to heat the glass up and use a guitar pick to peel it off.", "time": "02-13-2016 10:25 AM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"title": "(-HD-) Wallpapers", "thread": [{"postID": "post4780987", "text": "I'll post these for now if you guys want more just let me know!

I also want a cheap plan and would like to know what folks are using. Unfortunately I'm outside Republic's area, Ting is CDMA, and apparently the phone doesn't work with Freedom Pop.", "time": "09-30-2015 10:03 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4926242", "text": "Hi Chris. Let's attack this one step at a time.\nFirst avoid Freedom Pop with every fiber of your being. They have a long list of complaints filed against them. They take money from people for phones they never send. Or they take your money and send you a phone that does not work and then when you try and contact them you get no response. If you happen to get a working phone by some miracle then they overcharge you or charge you for services you did not use. In particular many older people like yourself have been bilked out of money for products or services they never received. Have a friend or family member who is more tech proficient do a Google search for \"Freedom Pop Complaints\" and you will see for yourself/ Once they get ahold of your credit card, which they require to set up your account they will continue to charge you incredible fees for things you never received or used. Please, for your own sake look elsewhere because you will end up spending more money than if you go with a known company.\nBeing that your phone is CDMA it pretty much limits your choices. Verizon and Sprint are the two that spring to mind. Walmart also has a Straight-Tlk plan that works with CDMA phones and carriers. If you have one in your area you can take it into the store and they will set everything up for you. There is a cost for the activation kit and you will also have to put up your first month's payment of $45. I know that can be a lot, but believe me it is far, far less than you will end up paying to Freedom Pop for service you will never receive. There may be others but you may have to have that friend do a little online research for you in this area as well.\nNow, on to the wi-fi without a sim.\nBefore you get started you are going to need to know the name of the wireless network you want to connect to and the password for your wireless router/gateway device. This information can usually be found right on the router/gateway itself (Note: the password may be called an SSID.) If it is not on the device you will have to make a call to the company where you get your wireless service and ask them for this information. Just to be safe write it down for now, Once you have that information then you can proceed as follows:\n1) Plug in your phone to be sure that you have enough power.\n2) Turn your phone on and wait for the first screen that says BLU or whatever on it to finish loading. \n3) You should now be at what is called your Lock Screen. Gently swipe your finger tip up from the bottom toward the middle of the screen (or if you have set up a password or pin enter that)\n4) You should now be at what is called your Home Screen (the one with all of the icons for the stuff that is installed on your phone).\n5) Go to the top of the screen and gently swipe your fingertip down from the top of the screen towards the middle. This should bring down a Quick Setting menu. Look for the words wi-fi and the symbol that almost like a funnel. \n6) Lightly touch this and something should pop up with a list of the wi-fi networks available to you. Pick the one with the name that matches the network name you got from your router/gateway device or wireless service provider. Enter the password provided (remember it might say SSID instead of password.\n7) If everything went smoothly up to this point you should be connected to your wireless network in under a minute.\nI hope this helps you out and works for you as it did me. By doing this I was able to use my phone over wi-fi for about two weeks until I got the sim card (my phone is a GSM).\nI will try and keep tabs on this discussion and see how it goes for you.", "time": "12-31-2015 05:06 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Why do my apps close when my phone is moved?", "thread": [{"postID": "post4922938", "text": "i have a BLU studio energy 2 running android 5.0, whenever my phone is moved or shook all apps close and ram is cleared, how can i disable this?", "time": "12-30-2015 01:15 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Blu Studio X Plus Wifi problem.", "thread": [{"postID": "post4921421", "text": "Hey all, I have a blu studio x plus and I'm having a bit of trouble with my wifi.

I did not have the problem where the internal storage is permanently taken up by apps. If I delete a big app, I get the storage back. It is true that many fewer of my apps can be moved to the SD card, but I did not have any problems moving the ones that can be moved. When I moved all of them, the free space on my internal storage did increase --- just not by as much as I would expect from KitKat. One issue is that after moving an app to the SD card, its total storage can actually go up. I read somewhere that even after you move an app to the SD card, it still takes up some space in the internal storage. For small apps, it might not save any storage to move it to the external SD card.\nThe stock camera app cannot store photos on the SD card. I found one app that can do this: Snap Camera HDR. There are probably others. But even in this case it does not store the photos in DCIM. It has to store the photos in the Android/media/com.marginz.snap subdirectory.\nGenerally, managing the SD card is a big problem. Android 5.0 is supposed to have a mechanism whereby the user can grant permission to individual apps write access to specific directories of the external SD card. For example, I want ES File Explorer to have full access, and Rocket Player to be able to write to Music. When I go thru the steps for ES File Explorer, there is supposed to be a menu item that says \"Show SD Card\". This menu item does not appear. So, I cannot select a directory to grant ES File Explorer permission. This bug has been reported many times. I cannot post links yet, but if you google \"issue 94083 android 5.0\", you will see the problem.\nThis is a shame because most things are working fine.

And indeed the build and kernel versions both have dates of 16 Nov 2015, and a couple of weeks of internal testing on a stable version seems reasonable before release. This was announced as being available in July 2015, but hey, better late than never!\nI am usually not one to install new OS versions until the bugs have been worked out and only if I really see value in the new features (hence on my iPhone 5 I am still at 7.1 and refuse to \"upgrade\" to the seemingly increasingly buggy and bloated versions since then). But in this case I really wanted to get my hands dirty, so to speak, with Android, and what better way to do so than being one of the first to install a new OS version!\nSo here are my initial impressions (after about 8 hours). I will continue to post updates as I go through the process, for the benefit of others.\nFor those who want the bottom line: The update is not trouble free by any means, but I think I've worked through it, and it's nonetheless left me rather impressed with BLU's technical support and customer service. So here is the blow-by-blow report:\n1. The update is a 2-step process. You first install something like a BLU_X010Q_V18_GENERIC (which is still Android 4.4.4 but has the upgrade loader built-in). This first installation is very quick, just a couple of minutes. After the auto-reboot, you will be prompted to do the real Kit Kat to Lollipop upgrade (which you can defer until a better time and continue to use the phone--it will remind you every 24 hours).\n2. Once you say yes to the main upgrade, you will download a close-to-1GB file, followed by a claimed 15-minute installation time (it was actually somewhat longer). It then indeed boots up under Android 5.0.2 (build name is BLU_X010Q_V09_L_GENERIC, so a new numbering scheme).\n3. It seemed to boot up under 5.0.2 just fine with my original unlock code and other settings intact. Note, however, that the 4.4.4 launcher for this Blu model was not the stock launcher but rather a simpler one where all the apps are always on your home screens with no App drawer. With 5.0.2, they have returned to the standard App drawer model. So none of your launcher customizations will be retained (e.g., folders you may have created).\n4. Immediate problem: After about 5 minutes of use under 5.0.2, the device abruptly rebooted without warning, and presented a window saying \"Starting Apps\" with the revolving doughnut. This remained for far longer than necessary to start any number of apps (I waited about 15 minutes), so I had to hard-restart it holding down the power button. It came back up without this problem and appeared stable and useable. But this was not to last.\n5. There were two initially alarming problems that came up almost right away:\na. Even though the device was plugged in and charging, the battery percentage indicator was slowly going DOWN!!\nb. I got a message that Google Play Services needed to be updated for the Google Play to continue to work, but when I tried to do so, it claimed that there was insufficient memory for the installation (not true). No amount of rebooting or removing every single thing from internal memory and moving to the SD card helped resolve this fake \"out-of-memory\" problem.\n6. I called customer support. They answered relatively promptly, were extremely courteous and respectful, and pretty knowledgeable. To my surprise they immediately offered to replace the phone under warranty(!). This surprised me for 2 reasons: Firstly, for the low price-point that BLU maintains, it's very unusual to find a company so willing to replace a phone so promptly \"no questions asked\" (I hadn't even asked for a replacement, nor did I really want one if the phone wasn't bricked, and it hardly seemed to be). Secondly, because it really was premature. The agent did suggest to do a hard reset (wiping out everything :-() and let it charge longer, which of course were the correct suggestions, but said they'd be happy to replace it under warranty if this didn't work. So kudos to BLU for customer support!\n7. But back to the two problems. The charging problem disappeared on its own and the phone started showing increasing numbers rather than decreasing numbers. I attribute this to the battery monitoring routine needing to recalibrate after it was reset upon the major upgrade and it was showing erratic numbers during this initial period. So I wouldn't let that worry you if you see it--let it charge overnight and it should be fine. It seemed to be just an artifact. This is just my speculation.\n8. The fake out-of-memory problem was more serious. Under Settings > Storage it was showing my internal storage as being 3 GB OS (correct) and 7 GB apps (+0.2 GB other stuff)! Clearly impossible to have 10+ GB in internal memory since the phone only has 8 GB of internal storage! Somehow, it got confused and was registering the memory usage of ALL my apps (most of which were on the SD card) as if they were all on internal memory. And the OS was incorrectly reporting to any app that tried to use more memory that it was already full. No amount of rebooting fixed this. I unmounted and removed the SD card and it temporarily cleared but as soon as I put the card back in, the problem returned.\n9. So the next step was to do a \"factory reset.\" I have now done a Factory Data Reset (via Settings > Backup & Restore > Factory Data Reset) which pretty much wipes out everything and you will have to reinstall everything from scratch or if you have everything backed up on Google, you can let it reinstall everything for you. (I took the precaution of plugging the phone into my computer over USB and making a full copy of \"Internal Storage\" and \"SD Card\" before doing this reset.) This has apparently fixed the problem with the false memory reporting. (I didn't need to do the raw hard reset via Vol+/Power).\nHere is my take-away after 8 hours:\n- You should not expect the update to work seamlessly as an update, retaining all your apps and data, and so on. Maybe if you have no SD card at all, it possibly might, but even then I wouldn't count on it. So assume you will have to do a hard reset and restore your phone from backups (either manually if you know how or from the cloud automatically, or some combination).\n- DON'T do this when you are travelling or don't have the time to dedicated several hours to getting your phone back up to where you want it to be with no urgent use of your phone anticipated.\n- There is no way to go back to the previous Android version 4.4.4 once you start the download (there isn't even enough memory in the phone to hold both versions ...), so if you don't like 5.0.2 you're stuck (if the phone bricks, you're stuck too until you can mail it in to BLU and get a replacement).\n- Initially I found 5.0.2 to be VERY sluggish compared to 4.4.4. It seemed like it was almost not responding. But after some usage it seems to have stabilized and now is SLIGHTLY more sluggish, noticeable but not bad.\n- Interestingly (shockingly, even ...), the amount of internal memory taken by 5.0.2 (3.13 GB) does not seem to be more than that taken by 4.4.4, perhaps even less (I recall 4.4.4 being 3.x but more than 3.13)!!\nI don't yet have a recommendation on whether to do the upgrade or not, but I will after some days of use. For now, this is only a report of how the upgrade process went and what it took to get my phone back to being useable!", "time": "12-03-2015 07:20 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4873956", "text": "Thanks for this--I'm going to leave the link to your 2nd post here, which is even more comprehensive, and close this thread so that we don't get parallel discussions going. http://forums.androidcentral.com/blu...op-update.html", "time": "12-04-2015 03:16 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "How to kill / disable / uninstall \"launcher v 4.2.2\" app?", "thread": [{"postID": "post4836952", "text": "Hi people, I have a \"blu dash music\", and never had problems, but now appears to be a new legion of phishing apps that auto-installs into device .\nSome \"launcher v 4.2.2\" installed into my phone, but it does'n exist on google play, so I don't know how to kill it, or even where it came from.\nIt appears with \"disable\" button on grey (unable to press it), and when \"force stop\" it produces an havoc on device because prevent lot of tasks and processes.
