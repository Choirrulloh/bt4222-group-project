Privacy and security signatures are actually hard-baked into the individual components of the BlackBerry hardware. On top of that, the Android OS has been massaged to be a lot more secure to the point that BlackBerry has the only Android based range of devices to secure the top security ratings of the world's top governments and militaries. This all costs money. Add to that all sorts of additional secure and privacy applications through BB UEM and you have a device that cannot be beaten for privacy and security. If none of that is a big deal to you then this is not a device that will ever interest you. This is a device whose primary customers will be Enterprise, Government and military with some consumer interest thrown in for good measure.
