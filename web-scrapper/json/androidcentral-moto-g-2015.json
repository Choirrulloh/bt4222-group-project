On my Moto G3 have 4.5G available of 8G Internal storage of which ~ 1.2Gb is unaccounted for under Internal Storage/Apps. I need to keep clearing cached data because Android will not update anything after I cross the 4.1Gb threshold in Internal Storage (<500Mb left)This situation will never improve and IMHO cell phones should not be sold with less than 16Gb of Internal storage leading me to my second point ......\nSecondly, \"adoptable storage\" as advertised to the uninitiated does not work as one would expect. The reason is that Android actually uses an emulated SD card slot as part of internal storage at the /storage/emulated location when there is no SD card installed. Once an SD card is \"mounted\" as adoptable storage Android creates another physical location where all user data is encrypted and moved to the /storage/emulated that is now pointing to the SD card so that all private data is in one place...seems reasonable. However, things get a bit sticky from here on out - Android's guarantee of app privacy (a good thing) means that user data is now moved to the encrypted SD card to I believe a /data/media file location so that private data is no longer shared between internal and adopted storage on the SD card. The bottom line is that developers still need to grant permissions for their apps to be moved to \"adopted storage\" and any updates are targeted there instead of the /data/app folder in internal storage. This is the simple explanation as to why adopted storage capacity does not show up as part of Internal storage... they cannot be shared. It is in actuality more complicated and convoluted than this and we can all hope that Google works out the kinks in the file system.\nAs a side note: there have been quite a bit of problems with the Marshmallow version of Android recognizing SD cards or should I say maintaining a nice working relationship with the cards (sarcasm rears it's ugly head!). Personally, I have had these problems with my phone in that my Sandisk 32Gb SD card that I chose to mount as \"adoptable storage\" installed successfully and functioned for approx. 1 month and since then I have had to reboot or re-install the card for it to work for a few days.

Once you do this the SD card will not show up under Windows as a separate storage location. Instead You will only see the phone in windows and the everything on the phone and SD card will appear under the phone as one large storage device.\nYou also have to make sure that the phone is setup as MTP for USB.\nI personally do not like the way Android 6 handles SD cards. It is weird and confusing.\nIf you want a particular app on your phone to sit on the SD card you have to go to settings/apps/'app name' and change the storage location (either 'phone' or SD card').\nAnyway, Android 6 has some weird way of viewing the SD card as an extension of the internal memory and it is very annoying and confusing.\nI have also noticed that Android 6 also periodically can't access the SD card for whatever reason which requires rebooting the phone. This is also annoying. This is especially true if your phone suffers from the Android 6 excessive battery drain and running hot issues.\nTo be honest, I haven't seen any benefit to Android 6 over 5.x.x.

No media, no phone rings/notifications, no text sounds when I push on the keyboard keys, nada. I've had this issue before, and I've taken my phone into my local carrier store for this issue before, and a worker soft reset - at the time, I had forgotten that was a thing, I used to do it frequently to get my iPod touch working - and it fixed the issue.

I'VE EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM IN SHORT DOWN THERE \nI've been having a ton of problems with my technology and I have been trying to solve them for three days now. The HP forum redirected me back here as a last resource.\nHere's a full explanation of my probllem (don't mind the recurring informality, the original post was meant for Reddit but the website blocked me from posting on my first day of registration):\nTechnical info:\nPhone: Moto G (2015)\nmicroSDXC: SanDisk Ultra (64gb) (apparently xc I)\nAdapter: SanDisk Adapter (microSD, microSDHC, microSDXC)\nLaptop: hp's pavilion dv6, 64-bit OS: Windows 8.1 Pro\nMy problem:\nIN SHORT:\nall my files are always getting corrupted when I move them to the SD card (on my phone move media option, not on a laptop). I can't move them manually to the SD card folder on my laptop either. Apps won't move to the SD card while on my phone too. My laptop won't recognize my SanDisk adapter, which contains my 64gb microSDXC card, that I'm inserting in the laptop to format because somebody said that could be a solution. But my laptop won't even recognize it, if something was supposed to show up on \"MY COMPUTER\". COMPLETELY frustrated. Have spent hours downloading +50 albums and organizing hundreds and hundreds of photos in spe\ncific albums on google photos, so I REALLY want some help.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Motorola said the Moto G (2015) could only hold up to 32gb, but in one of the links I provided people on the forum are saying there have been people who could use the 64gb (and even up to 128gb) at ease. \nNOT IN SHORT:\nSo I bought the Moto G (2015) a couple of weeks ago and some days later a bunch of music and image files got corrupted, and I didn't even know why... Somebody told me to install an anti-virus, and I did, a few days ago. Yesterday, I factory reseted my new phone for the first time, to try and get rid of the said \"virus\" (and i think there was one tbh). I also did that to remove my corrupted files and later on manually transfer the backup data of them (in my laptop) to the post-factory reset phone, specifically to the 64gb microSDXC card i bought, through a phone-usb cable-laptop connection. So first I tried transferring the files either directly from the desktop to the SD card folder or by moving them from the desktop to the internal storage folder and THEN on to the sd card folder, but neither worked because the files wouldn't transfer at all. So, alternatively, I tried leaving them on the internal storage and disconnecting the phone from the laptop, and then, on my phone, proceeded to attempt to move the files to the SD card, by clicking on the move media option in the storage settings. It took a long while and, once the moving was over, ta-da, all the files came out instantly corrupted. BEFORE even doing this media transfer on the storage settings, I had completely wiped the memory of the SD Card.\nThe next day, I got suggested to put my microSDXC inside my SanDisk adapter (which apparently is compatible with microSD, microSDHC and microSDXC) and then inside a PC/laptop so I could format the former and then maybe I'd be able to use it. After... some time... trying to firgure out what was wrong with my laptop for not recognizing the adapter, I realized it was backwards. -facepalm- Ok! Yay everything's resolved.

Naturally, I got an SD card to expand the laughable amount of storage, thinking all I needed to do was copy paste my apps and files on there. Right from the get go I was faced with a decision : Format as external or internal storage. After some quick googling, I found out that in order to move apps, it has to be internal. I bit the bullet, knowing that it would render it unusable in anything else than my phone, because I desperately needed space (that darn ''internal storage almost full'' notification had to go). It was ok at first, before I realised that half the apps refuse to move to the SD card. What gives? Oh well, at least I can save pictures on there, right?\nNope, as I recently found out. I was taking pictures out on a trip and lo and behold, my internal storage became full. I was confused, because I have about 58gb of free space on my card. I figured I could just copy the pictures over and delete them in order to take more. Problem is, I cannot find the option. I got file manager apps, to no avail. I plugged the phone into the computer, same thing, the option isn't there. I tried changing the settings in the camera app to save to the card, but the option isn't even there. I took the card out and put it back in. The device does recognize it, just not when it comes to moving files to it I looked in some other posts, and apparently if the card is formatted as internal storage, I can't save pictures on there. What? Why? What is the point of getting a card if I have to choose between moving apps(most of which who won't even give the option) or pictures? If I do it the other way, I can't move apps over. What am I supposed to do? I'm sorry I couldn't afford a fancy schmancy 800$ phone with 20 gigs of space or whatever. I'm basically stuck with a pitiful ~0.5gb of space for pictures, between all the apps that won't move and the OS. I'm out of ideas, and I just feel like throwing my phone against the wall every time I see the asinine : ''Storage almost full/ Insufficient storage'' notifications. No it's not darnit, there's 58gb of space just waiting to be used.

You want a Class 2 or Class 4, but nothing higher than 4. You don't want high read/write speeds, you want high Random Access response times.\nClass 10 = High Write/Read, Very Low Random Access response times.\nClass 2 = Low Read/Write, Very High Random Access response times.\nIt's a give or take, but not both. You don't want high read/write speeds on sdcards, they are all very slow anyways.\nClass 10 cards are for digital cameras that has 10 to 20 MB of data to write as fast as it can. They are not for mobile devices.\nAll mobile devices (Windows Mobile, Windows Phone 7 (my personal hacks), multiple Androids, etc) all have built-in \"timeouts\" for request queues when reading/writing to a device (e.g. sdcard). This is because mobile devices are synchronous, with only a single device able to read or write bits at a time. Eveyrthing goes into a \"queue\" waiting to read/write, and everything has a timeout in that queue.\nI had all sorts of issues with Windows Mobile and Android phones in the past, but they still worked mostly. Until I got my Windows Phone 7 two years ago and immediately opened my HTC Arrive to replace the 16 GB Class 2 card with a 32 GB Class 10. Immediate crashes, reboots, etc followed. Returned the card, got a new one, same thing. \nAs it turns out, a local Microsoft rep told me the secret: Windows Phone 7 operating system has \"stricter timeouts\" for the storage queue (read/writing). They require extremely low Random Access times to shave 50% or more \"milliseconds\" from the response of WP7's GUI. That's what makes WP7 so \"snappy\" with instant touches.\nThat made perfect sense! I since purchased a SanDisk Class 2, stuck it into my HTC Arrive, and had zero problems. The device was rock solid, and very very fast. I have since purchased Class 2 and Class 4.\nThe problems that Microsoft had with the first batches of WP7 devices was that no one could produce an SDCard with a low-enough response times. SanDisk was sold out of the Class 2/4 16GB sdcard cards for 3 months, which delayed a large amount of WP7 phones from being shipped.\nJust want to reiterrate that I have since purchase 6 or 7 Class 2 and 4 cards rangomg from 16 GB to 64 GB, and they have all worked flawlessly for my devices and all friends' devices that asked me which card to get, including on friend with a Galaxy Note 2 and a 32GB Class 2 card.", "time": "10-22-2015 04:42 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4773155", "text": "So I ran the app and it doesn't identify the manufacturer of the SD card.

This bucket is only updates with OS updates (including security patches if you're lucky enough to get them). It also includes pre-installed apps, be they google stuff like the play store, gmail, the google app, manufacturer apps (by samsung, etc),... This is the only part that survives a factory reset. You can't really touch this without root.Apps and app data: This is where apps are installed, and where apps keep their private files. When you update a pre-installed app, the original app remains in the OS bucket, and an updated copy lives here, meaning that that preinstalled app takes twice as much space as a normal app. Again, your access to this is very limited without root.User data: This is nowadays in the device's internal memory, but originally phones had very little internal memory and so this lived in the SD card. This is why the directory is still called sdcard, because it used to be a real SD card, and apps expected this bucket to be there. You have full control over what's here, and that's where apps put your photos, your videos, and also where your downloaded files go... One important directory here is the android directory, since apps will place their large files (think about games, the APK for the game is usually at best 100 MBs, but they might include gigs of additional data for textures, music, scenarios,...). You have full control over this directory.External Storage: This is the actual SD card. Normally it's reserved for multimedia files and documents.\nWhat adoptable storage does, is move all the user data, normally under the sdcard directory that resides in the internal memory, to the external SD card, and makes the apps use that instead of the internal memory to store their stuff. Apps and appdata buckets will remain in your internal memory. Depending on your apps, you might not experience large savings (some apps are smart enough to use external storage if possible, even if it's not adopted, while others will put everything in the app and app data bucket.\n*I call them buckets instead of partitions, since now the app and appdata, and the user data share the same partition.", "time": "09-07-2016 02:08 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5401766", "text": "All well and good, but for the end user there is no advantage at all !!", "time": "09-07-2016 02:20 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5401925", "text": "In my opinion there is a significant disadvantage.

Clearing data on Media Storage and External Storage removes the databases that MTP USB Connection and other services in the phone use to keep track of the files and their location in the device, when the device is rebooted these are automatically rebuilt. \nThe worst thing that I have seen happen is if you have non-system sounds defined for ringtones, alarms, notifications, etc. the system temporarily loses track of them, the files are still there but the system doesn't know it, and resets the sounds to default, or sometimes to None (not cool for alarms, made me late for work one day), because they don't exist in the media database anymore. You may have to manually reassign them after the databases are rebuilt.\nRemember that we do not have direct access to storage anymore, USB Mass Storage was removed from Android several versions ago, so our access is emulated through MTP or PTP, which requires database files to know what files are where. That is why clearing data on these \"apps\" can fix these access issues because it forces the system to rebuild those databases. This can also help other things, for example, sometimes if you add a sound to /storage/{sdcard}/Alarms and try to set, it doesn't show up in the list of available sounds, clearing data on these apps and rebooting often corrects that by rebuilding the databases properly.\nTo be honest though, your problem sounds bigger than just a connection issue... You may have a bad card or corrupt one. I would remove it from the device and connect it to a card reader and copy all the files off that way and reformat the card.

People can argue with me on that all you want, but there is a real discrepancy in the level of device here and how it is engineered. That being said, you should not have significant lag or issues using the phone, although multitasking can get a little funky when several apps are open at the same time, but it still shouldn't be a real problem. The free memory thing isn't a problem, the phone will use most of the memory for caching applications and release when needed, that is how the Android (Linux) kernel works. Keep in mind this is a budget device, and your model is the bottom level device (there is a 2GB/16GB version that handles multitasking much better). \nI would do a factory reset, and not install any applications, must use the embedded ones for a few days... does the problem still exist? If it does, you may have a defective device and should contact Moto Customer Care. If it is fine, then load your apps and run it for a few days normally, does the problem occur now? If so, one of two things is occuring, you either are using an app that is bogging down the system, or the device just doesn't have the horsepower/memory for what you use it for and you should consider a more powerful device well you are still within your \"buyers remorse\" window with AT&T.\nOne more question, are you using an SD card as adopted storage?

Only an OK button and no X or \"No thanks\" or even \"Later\" option. Just \"OK\". When the message covers your screen and you can do nothing else on your phone until that message is cleared, in my world, that's called not having any option. As for whether or not I had knowledge of it, not sure how to answer that... seems obvious I did.\nAs for what I didn't want? I had a 2 week old phone that absolutely sang. Everything I wanted was at my finger tips in lightning speed. In an instant, my wi-fi connections went from immediate to 30 seconds or more and sometimes requiring multiple on/off cycles to convince it to connect. This is not to different wi-fi hotspots... this is to my home wi-fi, configured properly and running perfectly for all other phones, iPads and laptops in the house. Additionally, and like many have complained here, the internal storage, file and SD card management is beyond unworkable. My issue is a bit different from many others who complain to have a new /0/ directory emulating folders. I too have that same /0/ but my folder contents are not emulated or duplicated. The folders themselves are but not the files... for instance, in Gallery, I have an Album called \"Kids\". If I take a picture of my kids it will initially go to an album called \"SD Card\" by default. I go into that folder, select my new photo, select the three dot menu, select \"Move to\" and choose the \"Kids\" album. Once complete, it brings me to my albums list again and I see two \"Kids\" albums... one with all the previous kids photos and one with only the new photo. If I try to move it again, I then have two \"Kids\" albums in my list and no matter how often I try, I cannot get them all together into just one.\nI've tried going and moving it physically using ES File Explorer and when I cut it out of the one folder, by the time I navigate to the second (original) kids folder, I can no longer paste the photo and it is lost forever.\nI also tried copying files rather than cutting and when I go back to delete the ones from the folder I don't want, it deletes all of them.\nAnd all of the above can be repeated for my eMails as well except in gMail it's \"Tags\" not folders and eMails will randomly appear in my Inbox or, most often it will say \"You're all done here, have a nice day!\" and yet I know I received mail because I can see it on my laptop. A day or two later, it might pop up under some random tag I never asked for, or, better still, I will click on \"All Mail\" and get swamped with dozens of unread eMails. I've seen many forums with people complaining about gMail tags so perhaps that's not related to Marshmallow. But again, I had everything working perfectly for two weeks before all this mess started. If gMail issued a release at the same time as the new Android system, then I guess they're both messed up.\nAdditionally, I cannot predict whether or not my camera will be trying to write to internal storage even though I've set it to use the SD card, out of the blue it will ditch my recorded item due to lack of space caused by all these apps that have inexplicably been permanently moved off my SD card and have used up all the real estate on my internal storage.\nIf I had the wherewithal to have taken a screen shot of the \"no option, we're ramming this marshmallow down your throat\" I highly doubt I would have been able to locate it to post it here.", "time": "02-26-2016 12:20 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5017877", "text": "That's a lot of trouble you're going through, I had similar experiences regarding storage management and had to downgrade... but to be honest the update was never \"forced\" on my device(s), I simply wanted to try it.

Seeing members who are trying to avoid them isn't that common and I was curious what it was that would make someone not want the update, especially given the better security, stability, resource management, battery life, etc. Other than users not understanding how SD card functionality changed and how to use it, most of the experiences shared have been resoundingly positive. And all of those experiences are found after trying it, not before. So learning about what you don't like after installing it doesn't explain the apprehension beforehand. Make sense?

Basically, the method is to first delete all Google Play Music data of your device, then open up the Google Play Music website on a PC. Go to My Library and download all the music that you want on your SD card to a folder on your PC (have to download albums or individual songs, can't download playlists) - you do this by opening the \"three dot menu\" for each album or song and clicking download. Then, connect your phone to the PC via usb, and change the usb connection setting to MTP (defaults to charging). Now your phone and phone's SD card should show up on your PC's file explorer, so all you need to do is copy all the music you want to a folder on your SD card (just make a new one, name is not important). I have done this with all my music and can confirm it works. As a side note, if you download more than one song from an album at a time then the songs are save as zip files - the Google Play Music app will [I]not[I] recognise this, so you will have to extract the songs from the zip files before copying, although being in an unzipped folder works fine. \nHope this helps anyone in a similar situation to me!", "time": "04-08-2016 04:29 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "How can I safely (soft)brick my phone?", "thread": [{"postID": "post5110435", "text": "I need to stay away from my phone (Moto G3, running 6.0.1, if it matters) for a while (exams, specifically).

Since the phone only has 8gb internal space I was eager to update because Marshmallow allows using the sd card as internal storage. However I am confused about how this works.\nI put in a 32 gb sd card and it prompted me whether I wanted to use it as portable storage or internal. I selected internal, and it formatted it. Good. However when I installed some apps, only one out of about 10 (Netflix) gave me the option of installing it to the sd card. The other ones installed themselves to the internal storage and as far as I can see they can't be moved to the sd card.\nWhen I go to Storage & USB, it lists the following:\n5.36gb used of 36.50gb\nAndroid OS 3.47gb\nInternal storage 1.79gb used of 4.53gb (where is this 4.53 figure coming from? The phone is supposed to have 8gb of internal storage)\nsd card 101mb used of 28.50gb\nI'm really confused by the 1.79 of 4.53 gb part, does this mean I have only another 2.74gb of space left to install apps? What about the other 32 gb from the sd card that it claims to be using as internal storage? As far as I can see most apps are still installing themselves to the internal storage (the true internal storage, not the sd card) and there is no option to move them to the sd card.", "time": "03-27-2016 01:53 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5088876", "text": "Welcome to Android Central! If you set the card to be internal storage (i.e. adoptable storage), then it should report the total internal storage to be the phone's internal storage + the SD card, all in one. Read more here: Inside Marshmallow: Adoptable storage | Android Central\nThis article also shows a good side-by-side comparison of what the storage menu should look like with the SD card used as portable and when it's used as adoptable (internal): Adoptable storage in Android 6.0: What it is, how it works | Greenbot. Notice that that left image lists the SD card under \"Portable Storage,\" while the right image has the SD card listed right after Internal Storage, without a Portable Storage heading. From what you're describing, it sounds like it's reporting the storage appropriately. It seems that although the card is incorporated into internal storage, the system will still keep track of how much data is in each physical location (onboard internal storage vs the microSD).\nThe 4.53 GB of available onboard internal storage is not surprising, because of the 8 GB of onboard storage, some of it has to be used by the OS and any preinstalled apps. 4-5 GB of usable internal storage is not unusual (and is actually pretty good, since other phones can have lots of bloatware that takes up space).\nKeep installing apps, and don't worry about moving apps to SD.

I use them every now and then to clean my PC, unfortunately I didn't have one with me when this happened since I was at work -_-\nA few tips for using pressurized air cans:it's not just air and will smell. open a window when you use it.hold the phone at an angle (not the can!) and a few inches away from the nozzle (don't underestimate the pressure!). no direct bursts!test it on a surface and on your skin. a) to get a feeling for how strong the pressure is and b) sometimes the gases wil condensate on the surface. they usually immediately evaporate again but the can leave a white-ish stain. they can be removed but the speakers are hard to get to and very fragile.again: be very gentle with the pressurized air! microphones and speakers are very delicate things and can be damaged easily (not just the water-resistant lining). the USB port and audio jack should be much more durable and they collect lint/dust too. \nIf the pressurized air isn't enough you could (do this at your own risk!) try a very, very soft brush (like the ones used for camera lenses). Don't apply any force. Those fine \"hairs\" might be able to puncture the lining too if you press the brush directly on the speaker. It might be better to use a wiping motion with the hairs being \"dragged\" over the speaker at a very obtuse angle.\nGreat, now that it happened all those things come to my mind xD\nYeah, I get that Motorola was cutting costs whereever possible to keep the price low, but how much can those speaker grills really cost?", "time": "02-29-2016 12:13 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Moto G (3rd gen): 5.1.1 Recovery Image", "thread": [{"postID": "post5021449", "text": "(may need to be logged in) FACTORY IMAGES FOR DEVELOPER EDITION DEVICES https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/recovery-images\nUS:UK:BRAZIL:", "time": "02-28-2016 04:25 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5021632", "text": "Thanks for the links.

Unfortunately, Google and friends don't want to architect a competent way of controlling SdCard memory because they are (and have been making) billions of $$$ each year by selling new phones to people who just need another 8 GB of memory. It is like selling new cars to people who just need a new set of tires -- incredibly profitable!! As such, you can expect that an SdCard could, but won't, solve all of your problems. But it will help. You probably can, and certainly should, store all of your music, videos, pictures, and backup data onto an SdCard. I believe that the alternative solution (de-bloating) requires rooting your phone. Phone manufacturers working in alliance with their ISP buddies have conspired to fill the world's phones to the gills with unnecessary/commercial bloatware. After rooting, you can flash a custom ROM (eg. CyanogenMod) from which the bloat has been pre-removed. Or better still, you can use an app to perform the same service.

If anything this version is considerably \"snappier\" than the 1 GB RAM counterpart which is already snappy.*** Performance\n** MotoG3 8 GB storage / 1 GB RAM\nWith the usual apps installed (most common Google apps, social media apps, music, browsing and some games) the performance is generally great but with some caveats\n- Opening apps is a bit slow for some of the big apps such as Facebook when they're not cached / in memory.\n- Some apps suffer a bit from the 1 GB of RAM, for example the new Google Photos when browsing collections of large pictures and also Google Maps is a bit slow too, also Chrome is not good at keeping more than one tab in memory, which is understandable.\n- When the device really needs the memory for some other app in the foreground it can potentially shut down services in the background such as the noise reduction service from Motorola, causing it to restart and it takes a long while (best action here is simply restart the phone)\n- 5.1.1 and Marshmallow are trying to cache as many OS & system services as they can so with only 1 GB of RAM the memory is constantly being juggled around.\n- Gaming performance is ok, loading screens are not great but also understandable considering the free memory.\n- When Facebook (full app, not lite) is installed the device is affected when opening apps, not much slower but a tad slower.\n- Multitasking is OK, not great at all but really good for 1 GB of RAM and certainly much better than 95% of 1 GB phones out there, I had Facebook + one tab of Chrome + WhatsApp + Camera + Dialer with no refreshing, if you add something extra such as a game or Google Play Music then refreshing will happen.** MotoG3 16 GB storage / 2 GB RAM \nwith the same apps installed as the 8/1 version...\n- Opening apps is instant, it's the first thing you notice in this 16/2 version\n- Performance issues I had on some apps such as Google Photos / Google Maps are completely gone, don't know if it's optimization or simply the extra RAM, they simply run much, much better. Chrome loads pages faster and keeps more on memory, this was expected with 2x RAM of course.\n- OS caches a lot of system services in RAM (taking usually double RAM the 8/1 device used for the OS) and it won't shut down any service in the background, both 5.1.1 and Marshmallow starve for RAM and the more the merrier, one example is HDR, 16/2 is much faster at processing HDR pics even with the same CPU, reason being the service used by the OS to compute the final image is cached in the device and there's no need to call for it into memory and then run it. Apps are cached in full and not partially as with the 8/1 device, so the memory is not being assessed and tinkered with constantly.\n- Gaming performance is definitely better, loading screens are much quicker and performance a bit increased, all thanks to assets cached in the device.\n- When Facebook (full app, not lite) is installed the device is NOT affected when opening apps, seems like whatever resources Facebook wants it can find them on the 16/2 device.\n- Multitasking is better as expected, you won't see the Google Keyboard refreshing / reloading any more, there is not drop in performance with a lot of apps open, I can have Facebook + 3-4 tabs of Chrome + WhatsApp + Camera + Dialer + a game + Google Play Music and some more with no refreshing at all. Mind you that, for some reason, opening the native Motorola gallery or the Google Play store it will cause to shut down a random app in the background, I think this is GPU-memory related since there is plenty of RAM available for this to not happen, apart from that the 16/2 device sports amazing multitasking.\n- Bonus point: more internal storage = no fiddling with apps' cache anymore, just let it fill and manage itself, forget about it, with the 8/1 there's so little free storage you find yourself sometimes clearing cache here and there so the device is not below 1200 MB (1.2 GB) free storage (recommended for optimal storage read / write speed)\n- All in all the 16/2 feels like a yearly incremental upgrade compared to the 8/1 version, everything is ready to run and as fast as you expect, with zero lag. It performs on par and sometimes better compared to the Moto X my brother has, such an achievement considering it has much better battery time due to weaker CPU and screen resolution. After two months of 8/1 going into the 16/2 was such an eye-opener, simply amazing, good job on both devices but I can't recommend the 8/1 anymore if money is not a factor*** 5.1.1 vs 6.0\n**MotoG3 8/1 after upgrading to 6.0\n- I had a lot of bugs and issues with Marshmallow, some of them I could not fix by \"wiping the cache partition\" or even after a factory reset, the OS was snappy but not quite as snappy as 5.1.1, opening apps was faster but that's a change/feature in 6.0, the app is \"partially\" opened so it's brought faster to the foreground while the rest of the app (the part you don't see) is being loaded in the background. \n- Multitasking was much worse, I could not mix Facebook in anymore, there was much more refreshing and reloading, performance remained the same even for above-mentioned problematic apps and battery time was not really improved, maybe 1-2% extra save at night when phone is in \"sleep\" mode, battery is the same when actually using the phone, this is not a bad thing for 6.0, actually tells us how awesome 5.1.1 is optimized.\n- I had a lot of issues accessing my data be it on the SD card or the internal storage, sometimes clearing data and cache for both \"media\" and \"external media\" system apps would fix it but after a couple of days issues are back and then you're just tired of them. \n- All in all, worse multitasking, some minor bugs that didn't get fixed after a \"cache partition wipe\" and the USB troubles made me roll back to 5.1.1 and my mother, who uses the phone as the name suggests, \"a phone\", couldn't be happier with it, the battery time is 4-5 days in her case even with some chat usage here and there, some camera usage and specially Google Now which she did learn to use and she is amazing at taking advantage of.**MotoG3 16/2 after upgrading to 6.0\n- I had the same bugs and issues with Marshmallow, also some of them weren't fixed after wiping cache, the OS in this case takes advantage of the extra RAM and it feels a bit snappier (marginally, almost not noticeable) compared to 5.1.1, loading time when opening apps was equal, maybe marginally faster, a marginally better user experience compared to the 8/1 device if we forget about the bugs.\n- Multitasking is exactly the same as with 5.1.1, nothing to say here, also battery time was improved by the same margin (1-2% extra in \"sleep\" mode after 8 hours of sleep), battery usage remains the same when actually using the phone as in 5.1.1.\n- I had the same head-aching issues accessing my data be it on the SD card or the internal storage, clearing \"external / media storage data and cache\" would fix it as stated above but after some days issues are back.\n- All in all, solid performance plagued with major bugs that can be fixed (WiFi battery drain) and minor ones that cannot, same multitasking and, sadly, once again the USB troubles made me roll back to 5.1.1... but I never missed any feature from 6.0, on the contrary, the stability and being capable of quickly transfer / move files from a PC was so good to have back, 5.1.1 is amazing on these devices and I will wait for 6.X.X to hit before trying to upgrade again, it's not really worth it.*** Final words\nIf you're considering a MotoG3 do yourself a favor and get the 16/2 model, the hardware is held back by the 1 GB of RAM of the cheaper version in a lot of subtle and non-subtle ways, to me it's like night and day under some circumstances, also consider staying on 5.1.1 unless you really need some feature present in 6.0. Lollipop 5.1.1 is much more user friendly, stable and bug-free. You have all the reasons stated in this post that I hope I helped someone with.

Has anybody had experience doing this?

Portable storage is only intended as file storage, not for any applications.\nIf you are setup as Adopted Storage and move everything it asks to the card, you are correct, your SD card replaces your internal storage for the most part (some system apps still reside in internal space but you can't access it directly), and instead of 4.5GB (not 8GB) of space you would have 32GB of space plus whatever the system left on the real internal storage. It is honestly a little convoluted. \nSpeed reduction is tough, some users seem to have a noticeable slow down, and others little to none, but Android seems to complain the card is slow no matter what when you first set it up (this seems to be a phantom message in some cases). If you have a quality card that is UHS1/Class10 rated the slowdown should be minimal, I usually recommend Samsung cards as they manufacturer their own chips (for example, Kingston uses Samsing chips in most of their cards).\nIf the internal storage is changed to portable, the system will attempt to move everything if there is room, but it can fail.\nTo be honest, the best way to do this is with a clean phone, pick the way you want it to be and set up the phone afterward... if you are going to change it, the cleanest way is to factory default and setup again.

My reason for this concern is that I am traveling to Florida (from Canada) for Christmas, and after some reading I have concerns about whether or not my phone will work. I subscribe to Roam Mobility which uses T-mobile when in the U.S. The Motorola website indicates that the U.S. version of the Moto G 2015 DOES NOT use band 12, while the Canadian version DOES. I initially thought this was a good thing. But after some digging it appears that because I have band 12, but do not have VoLTE, I may not be able to make calls on the Moto G3. From what I am reading if band 12 is in use, it will not drop back to 2g/3g for phone calls. The calls won't work on T-mobile band 12 because it is used for Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) which the Moto G3 does not have. Can anyone confirm one way or the other if the Moto G3 Canadian version does or doesn't have band 12, and will the Moto G3 work on T-Mobile in the U.S. Thanks for any help you can offer.

The Idol 3 4.7 having NFC and Gyroscope is a big deal. Alcatel Onetouch didn't cut corners and threw in free headphones.

For instance riding a ski lift and making a phone call or while riding an amusement ride taking a picture with its camera. Or maybe one is a runner wearing a cotton sweatshirt with a single open pocket without a zipper. Many more. In such cases there is value in being able to secure a phone to clothing so it does not drop while handling or fall out of a pocket while in action moving. See image below.\nTo do so while skiing with the moto g I have attached a short 15 inch thin 2mm nylon cord between my ski jacket breast pocket zipper pull loop and a lanyard clip that I can then attach to the phone. The lanyard hooks are the most basic metal types available in small packages for a buck say at Walmart. The cord connects onto the lanyard clip end via a couple simple overhand knots that I've added a dab Gorilla glue stick glue so it cannot unravel. I actually have 2 of the hooks at the cord end knot to make sure the phone doesn't accidentally come lose. When not in use, I fit the cord into the pocket. \nSo the key information here is the attachment mechanism on the phone. If the moto g plastic rear cover is removed, the only place on the back where the cover would not be flush with the phone body is at the SIM and SDcard socket. That is where one can do something. Thus I drilled 2 small holes about 1/4 inch apart just behind the SIM socket. Through those 2 holes pushed a short length of 20 pound test monofilament fishing line into and then back out. I then created a one inch loop by tying two back to back overhand loop knots on the outside section of the line. The knot was again further made permanent by using Gorilla glue. And one could tie better knots. The knot was tied on the outside side of the cover holes in order to minimally get in the way of cover closure. I chose 20 pound mono because it is readily available, strong, and made for flexibility and stresses. \nThus clip the lanyards into the monofilament loop. One can readily check that there is no chance dropping the phone 15 inches from the pocket would cause the rear cover to pull off even slightly. The ability to clip and unclip the lanyard quickly or easily is not an issue because once connected it is left so while involved in whatever activity. In the above image the Cellet black belt case I use is also shown. When using while skiing, I put the clipped in phone into the case for a bit of mechanical protection. When I use the phone, I pull the phone out of the case that stays in the pocket. The case of course could be dropped if pulled out of the pocket, however that is inexpensive. Note I've worked decades in Silicon Valley hardware electronic engineering skilled at cluging.", "time": "12-27-2015 10:06 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4918830", "text": "That's a kludge:In spite of what you said I'd be afraid that in a drop that back would pop right off. A better solution would be an OtterBox Defender with the holes drilled into the back of the case. Once a phone is put into an Otterbox it's not easy to get it out (it's a PITA actually).", "time": "12-27-2015 11:07 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4919738", "text": "Indeed that is a healthy concern PG, thankyou.  So I'll expand a bit. I wasn't convinced myself until I made the modification then dropped it so, numerous times in all manner of orientations to see what happened. With the cord just 15 inches the longest drop held out at eye height might be 20 inches. The small weight of the phone just doesn't develop strong forces. Never did the corner where the SIM card is even pop out a tiny bit. Then I added more cord length to the drop and found at about 36 inches that corner of the cover peeled open a bit occasionally. Never did the cover fully disengage. From that limited testing I am pretty confident accidentally dropping from 15 inches is rather safe at least for my phone. An alternate design if the drop was an issue would use elastic 2mm shock cord.\nNow we all know how there are mechanical variances between individual units so I certainly won't claim everyone's phone would check out as mine did. However these expensive superbly engineered products in this era of automated production probably have rather tight dimensional specifications so maybe almost all would be as mine. Anyone making a modification can easily check it out for themselve while over something soft like a bed or couch. If it didn't work out, backing out and filling the tiny holes on the case with glue is trivial as are any affects to the case mechanical integrity.\nThe phone has some water immersion resistance and the rear cover slows entry of water into the back of the phone. The tiny drilled holes would allow water to enter that area a bit more. To eliminate that one can add glue into the holes after the monofilament is installed.\nAnd indeed the suggestion of performing a similar modification to any external phone case one may be using is likely to be more straightforward so can't possibly damage the phone itself. One would need to use a case that allows access and visibility to the display and all the buttons. A case that is simply for protection won't work because one would need to remove a phone from the case for use while in precarious activity that is the primary issue. Using a smartphone with or without a case in the way is a long running trivial discussion of personal preference. Some like the raw look and feel of their phones as is while others are fine encasing them with storm trooper suits.\nDavid", "time": "12-28-2015 11:33 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4919957", "text": "Ever seen an OtterBox defender?Rugged Moto G 3rd Gen.

For that it would require a design with a gasket and screws along edges applying pressure. What the rear cover will do is slow water entry significantly and minimize peak pressure on any inner entry locations. In other words if one drops into water say from a 4 foot height, the phone section impacting the water surface will bear increased forces of water entry. Thus as noted, I recommend adding a bit of glue sealing the holes after installing the monofilament line.\nA use update, I went skiing twice over the New Years holiday while carrying the phone as noted in my coat breast pocket. During that activity removed the phone several dozen times while up on lifts and on ski slopes in order to use the moto g 13 megapixel camera. That worked out very well with the corded lanyard system removing the usual extra careful need while handling. An extra benefit I had not expected is in order to remove the phone from the Cellet case, I merely need to grab the cord/landyard and pull up instead of trying to get my fingers around the top edge of the smooth phone.

I'VE EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM IN SHORT DOWN THERE \nI've been having a ton of problems with my technology and I have been trying to solve them for three days now. The HP forum redirected me back here as a last resource.\nHere's a full explanation of my probllem (don't mind the recurring informality, the original post was meant for Reddit but the website blocked me from posting on my first day of registration):\nTechnical info:\nPhone: Moto G (2015)\nmicroSDXC: SanDisk Ultra (64gb) (apparently xc I)\nAdapter: SanDisk Adapter (microSD, microSDHC, microSDXC)\nLaptop: hp's pavilion dv6, 64-bit OS: Windows 8.1 Pro\nMy problem:\nIN SHORT:\nall my files are always getting corrupted when I move them to the SD card (on my phone move media option, not on a laptop). I can't move them manually to the SD card folder on my laptop either. Apps won't move to the SD card while on my phone too. My laptop won't recognize my SanDisk adapter, which contains my 64gb microSDXC card, that I'm inserting in the laptop to format because somebody said that could be a solution. But my laptop won't even recognize it, if something was supposed to show up on \"MY COMPUTER\". COMPLETELY frustrated. Have spent hours downloading +50 albums and organizing hundreds and hundreds of photos in spe\ncific albums on google photos, so I REALLY want some help.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Motorola said the Moto G (2015) could only hold up to 32gb, but in one of the links I provided people on the forum are saying there have been people who could use the 64gb (and even up to 128gb) at ease.\nNOT IN SHORT:\nSo I bought the Moto G (2015) a couple of weeks ago and some days later a bunch of music and image files got corrupted, and I didn't even know why... Somebody told me to install an anti-virus, and I did, a few days ago. Yesterday, I factory reseted my new phone for the first time, to try and get rid of the said \"virus\" (and i think there was one tbh). I also did that to remove my corrupted files and later on manually transfer the backup data of them (in my laptop) to the post-factory reset phone, specifically to the 64gb microSDXC card i bought, through a phone-usb cable-laptop connection. So first I tried transferring the files either directly from the desktop to the SD card folder or by moving them from the desktop to the internal storage folder and THEN on to the sd card folder, but neither worked because the files wouldn't transfer at all. So, alternatively, I tried leaving them on the internal storage and disconnecting the phone from the laptop, and then, on my phone, proceeded to attempt to move the files to the SD card, by clicking on the move media option in the storage settings. It took a long while and, once the moving was over, ta-da, all the files came out instantly corrupted. BEFORE even doing this media transfer on the storage settings, I had completely wiped the memory of the SD Card.\nThe next day, I got suggested to put my microSDXC inside my SanDisk adapter (which apparently is compatible with microSD, microSDHC and microSDXC) and then inside a PC/laptop so I could format the former and then maybe I'd be able to use it. After... some time... trying to firgure out what was wrong with my laptop for not recognizing the adapter, I realized it was backwards. -facepalm- Ok! Yay everything's resolved. Except it isn't: even after inserting it correctly my laptop doesn't seem to recognize the adapter (with the microSDXC inside it). And this is where I don't know what to do (again lol). I've contacted SanDisk and HP but they'll still take a while to respond, and nobody seems to care for my problem on the android forums. So my last resource was reddit. Please! Can you help me?? I really need this music on my phone, I've meticulously organized my pictures into 7 specific folders (I don't even know if my phone will accept that) on Google Photos and downloaded 52 albums (and plan on downloading more), but it won't be of any use and my time will be wasted if this turns out to be unrealizable B( .\nI know this seems to be a complicated and boring matter but ugh you people are the only ones who can help me rn.\nAdditional info:\nRelated thread from android forums (IMPORTANT INFO): http://forums.androidcentral.com/moto-g-2015/595359-problems-sd-card-transferring-please-help-desper...\nMight help clarify some things: http://forums.techarena.in/portable-devices/1478407.htm", "time": "10-17-2015 01:34 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4758520", "text": "Sounds like a bad media card to me... you could format it, using a 3rd party utility like SD Formatter from sdcard.org or using Linux (most distos have a format tool built in).

I also did that to remove my corrupted files and later on manually transfer the backup data of them (in my laptop) to the post-factory reset phone, specifically to the 64gb microSDXC card i bought, through a phone-usb cable-laptop connection. So first I tried transferring the files either directly from the desktop to the SD card folder or by moving them from the desktop to the internal storage folder and THEN on to the sd card folder, but neither worked because the files wouldn't transfer at all. So, alternatively, I tried leaving them on the internal storage and disconnecting the phone from the laptop, and then, on my phone, proceeded to attempt to move the files to the SD card, by clicking on the move media option in the storage settings.

Counterfeiters take a smaller capacity card and program it to make it read as a larger card. So in your case, it's possible it was a 32 GB card that was programmed to read as a 64 GB or 128 GB card. Or maybe it was even smaller, like 4 GB, and the size that's displaying is completely inaccurate due to the tampering. In any case, these cards work fine as long as you haven't exceed their true capacity--but once you do, some or all of the data on the card might become corrupt. No one else has your data, so you don't have to worry about security breaches--but the data itself is probably unrecoverable.\nAvoid buying SD cards from random eBay sellers. Stick with well-established retailers--preferably bricks and mortar stores like Best Buy or CostCo, or online retailers with good reputations and good return policies, like Amazon.\nEven with genuine cards, always remember that SD cards are not forever--they can fail unexpectedly, due to defects or to wear and tear.

It cannot be set to mono audio output out-of-the-box. I currently use an LG Optimus L90, and in General Settings under Accessibility there is sub-heading named Hearing. In Hearing, I can set the Audio Type to either Stereo or Mono, and I can adjust Left-Right Channel Balance with a slider. There is another setting for Captions, but I am not hearing-impaired, so only the first two settings interest me. And frankly, I think those two setting should interest anybody who wants options for the output of audio. In other words, these two settings, Audio Type and Channel Balance, could just as well have been settings in the Sound section of Settings. They are fundamental and important options for listening to music, which, after all, is a primary use of smartphones. When I first started using the LG phone as a music device I found it very unpleasant to hear stereo music divided into separate channel components, especially when the sound was delivered directly into the ear canal with earbuds. I don't listen to music that way, with bass and drums in one ear, and with melody and voice in the other ear. I was greatly relieved to find the Mono setting in Accessibility. Mono audio output was a vast improvement in my listening experience. I recently learned, a bit late, that Lollipop does not support mono audio output. This baffled and disappointed me that Android would drop such an important setting. I am now struggling with the fact that Moto G 2015 does not support mono audio out, and confirmed same with Motorola Tech Support. Nobody seems to have a Lollipop phone locally or conveniently to answer my questions. I found one store employee who was helpful. He whipped out his LG Leon(?) running Android 5.1.1, checked the Accessibility section and there they were, the two settings that I want. Before this observation, I was assuming that KitKat had the two settings, but that Android mysteriously dropped them in Lollipop and Mushroom. Now I am thinking that these two settings in Accessibility come as a special feature on LG phones. I also recall reading that Samsung has the two desired settings. \nSo I need to know: Did stock KitKat have Accessiblity settings for Stereo/Mono selection and L-R Channel Balance? If so, why did Android drop the two Accessibility settings in Lollipop, and presumably Mushroom. If not, is this an exclusive LG feature? If Android never did provide these two settings, why not? If nothing else, it could have been included in the Hidden Menu, so that customers don't have to resort to buggy 3rd party apps or clunky adapters to acquire the functionality.\nYou might say, well then, your problem is solved, go buy an LG phone. To which I answer, I got an LG phone. I want a better phone that has front-facing speakers and LTE speed. So you see, I bought the Moto G mostly for its audio features, not knowing that mono audio output is unsupported. I checked all the phones with front speakers, including HTC models, and I thought I had a winner with Moto G. But now I find I can't get mono audio out of the earbuds. Well, that's a deal breaker for me.\nPlease give me a full clarification of this issue. Is it Android that doesn't support mono? Is it Motorola that doesn't provide the setting? Are the two settings provided in stock KitKat? Are the settings an exclusive benefit from LG? What other brands offer the two settings? Why can't Android provide these settings?\nWhat Players will output in mono as an option? (Not interested in PowerAmp, but I like MX Player.) Is there a third party app that will convert stereo to mono on-the-fly? Considering the Mono setting in LG phones, is the mono output lossy w.r.t stereo output? Will I have to root this phone in order to get mono out? Where can I get specific code to implement the settings? I can say, I am fairly happy with the mono sound coming out of the LG phone. If Android programmers would listen, they could just post a patch at Google Play Store for anyone who wanted Mono and Channel Balance settings? I've seen a hack for Mono Audio Out in less than 20 lines of code. What's the hangup?\nCan you recommend any other solutions, such as a Stereo-to-Mono adapter that will do the job? Is there a problem with impedance matching when using a simple adapter? Of course, it's very desirable to minimize the size of the adapter.", "time": "10-26-2015 03:04 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4779880", "text": "Anecdotal evidence: I went to a store where there were 4 or 5 clerks gathered around the cash register. I walked up and asked if anyone had a Lollipop phone. They all looked at each other and said, Nope. Well, I didn't leave right away and it turned out that one lady was holding out and felt reassured when I said I didn't want to touch it, I just wanted her to check for settings in Accessibility. She consented to check for me, and when I asked what brand phone it was, she said LG. I told her it would almost certainly have those settings I was looking for in Accessibility. She showed me anyway, and when she opened Audio Type, I could see that Mono was selected. By default, this setting is Stereo, so I'm pretty sure it was set to Mono on purpose. This lady was not hearing-impaired as far as I know, showed no sign of it either. I'm going to jump to a conclusion and say that if a normal listener has a choice of Stereo or Mono through earbuds, eventually the listener will choose Mono, because it provides a more even, consistent musical experience. At the time, my LG phone was set to Stereo because I thought I had imagined that a certain song was coming out in stereo even though my audio output was set to Mono, which, if true, would be a whole nuther can of worms. I don't really insert the earbuds all the way into my ear canal, just far enough for it to stay in, so it might have been the loose fit that was causing the discrepancy between right and left channels. Also, my left ear hears 10 or 15% less than my right ear, which requires the Channel Balance setting to correct. So I was trying to find that questionable track so I could hear it in stereo to determine if I had actually heard stereo when the Audio Type was set to Mono. I sort of lost track of that endeavor as I interacted with the sales clerk with a Lollipop phone. I was driving home and one of my favorite pieces started playing from my playlist. My phone was set to Stereo output, and I have to say that this wonderful piece of music sounded like crap in stereo. Mainly because the artist was ahead of his time, harmonically and rhythmically advanced, but he was playing with a rhythm section from his own period and the drummer's playing in particular was mediocre at best. Stereo put this drummer almost all alone in one channel playing with brushes which came across as very treble, and therefore distracting, if not downright annoying. The drummer was just time-keeping and it sounded awful when separated out like that. It was so awful, and I enjoy the artist so much, that I set the audio output back to Mono while I was driving home, and it made a big difference to get that drummer back in the band, where he really didn't sound that bad. I thus confirmed to myself that I was not imagining the improvement in listening when switching from Stereo to Mono. I need this Stereo/Mono setting. Music is very important to me. I bought the Moto G to listen to music, primarily. Another thing about stereo is the original intent of it. Back in the late 1950s, it was engineered to produce an illusion of spatial context for the music, in response to what? cinema? like make-believe theater? Stereophonic sound developed as a corollary to the development of cinematic sound production, and thus a visual element, whether cinematic or virtual, is implied in stereo production. That purpose is achieved to some degree when sound is propagated in a room, through the air. However, when the source of the sound is placed less than half an inch away from the listener's eardrum, the illusion of spatial context just doesn't happen because, for one thing, the sound is not in the space surrounding the listener anymore, much less in front of the listener as stereo was intended (as in a movie theater), rather, it's inside the listener's head. So stereophiles have to dream up another purpose for stereo such as playing little tricks with phasing, enough to make the listener dizzy. This can be a fun novelty, especially when it's well done, I could even see it as a specialty hobby. Recent stereo recording technique can be quite sophisticated and listenable. Maybe another dimension can be added with surround sound, which, incidentally, also requires a physical space to pull off the illusion. I ask you, can you hear in three dimensions through a set of earphones? But putting aside all the gimmickry, titillation, and marketing hype, stereo is unnecessary for listening to serious music, particularly through earbuds. Mono is more even, balanced, and consistently listenable than stereo, even if delayed timing between channels to fatten the stereo sound may introduce distortion when converting from stereo to mono. No one should be limited to one audio type or the other. Just make Mono an option.

The way they work is typically counterproductive to the way Android is designed, because Android wants to keep RAM relatively full. If you have an app that is constantly closing apps to \"boost\" RAM, the system will just open another app to fill the empty RAM. If this happens frequently, it can use up battery.

QuizUp seems to use a fair amount of data. If the app is constantly checking the web for updates while the phone is idle, that can contribute to battery use. If the game doesn't have its own settings where you can decide how often to check the web, go to Settings>Data Usage, select QuizUp, and turn on Restrict Background Data.\nRegarding RAM \"boosters\"--don't bother. The way they work is typically counterproductive to the way Android is designed, because Android wants to keep RAM relatively full. If you have an app that is constantly closing apps to \"boost\" RAM, the system will just open another app to fill the empty RAM. If this happens frequently, it can use up battery. In addition, Cheetah Mobile has not had the best reputation when it comes to things like adware and some other relatively slippery behavior, so I would recommend avoiding their apps.", "time": "10-10-2015 10:17 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Turned up all volume types but no sound", "thread": [{"postID": "post4733420", "text": "Just bought this phone today.

I do have a couple questions, and was hoping to get some help here.\n1) I know there is a way to set a specific phone call ringtone to each person in your contacts. Is there a way to do that with text notification sounds, or is it the same one all around? And if there is a way to do this, how?\n2) What are some useful apps and widgets for a new android user? Best gaming apps?\n2b) Specifically as well, are there any places to get good backgrounds that won't look blurry?\n3) Anyone have any little tips and tricks for new android users? I know the shaking tricks for camera/flashlight.\n4) Battery saving tricks would be helpful as well!\nI am getting cases and screen protectors from Amazon, and take good care of my phones regardless. I got two years out of my iPhone and never cracked my screen, just got a few scratches on the side. XD Thank you for any help~! \nAlso if you're curious, I love watching TV and movies on my phone, check social medias, favorite games are things like Tetris/Pokemon Shuffle/Sims/RPGs, some stuff to go on for suggestions too.  Thanks again!", "time": "09-16-2015 04:43 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4688930", "text": "Eh... most of these questions can be easily Googled, but since your coming over from the Dark Side, I'll cut you some slack. \n1) Yes, and no... You cannot set a specific text notification for a specific contact in the stock messaging app, but you can with some alternative messaging apps like Textra, Hangouts, or most other full featured messaging apps. If you like the stock app, you can use a third party tool like SMS Popup or Contact Alert.\n2) Tough one to answer because it's based on a personal preference, here is a general list of stuff:\nNova Launcher - for me, an absolute must! the Pro version with Tesla Unread Counts plugin, and throw in an icon pack of your choice (consider Action Launcher, Next Launcher, APUS Launcher, or Apex as alternates)\nEvernote - eh, everyone uses it, except me, I prefer Google Keep.\nSwiftKey (my personal fav) or Swype keyboard\nES File Explorer\nAccuweather (nice widget too)\nStarbucks/Caribou or your local area coffee shop loyalty app\nGoogle Drive\nGoogle Keep\nTextra or Chomp\nSoundhound or Shazam\nAmazon/eBay or other shopping app you use\nZedge\nZip Code Tools\nAirdroid\nSpotify/Pandora\nNoLED (since our phones do not have a working LED notification)\nFeedly (RSS feed reader)\nMint Personal Finance\nTwitter/Facebook or other social media app\nPushbullet\n2B) Zedge, or check any of the Wallpaper communities on Google+ or Facebook, or just google up some images of at least 1280x720 in size\n3) The best \"tips\" I can give you for a new user are to get to know the basics first, compared to an iPhone using Android is like going from a McDonalds to Fudruckers... What I mean is Apple kind of locks you in to certain things (we make it like this), but Android is very customization friendly (build it your way) and you can do about anything, there are dozens to hundreds of apps that can do the same thing, each has it's own pluses and minuses, SMS/Messaging apps, Weather apps, keyboards, media players, etc. Explore and try lots of stuff. A few tips I didn't know at first: Press POWER+VOL DN for a screen shot, swipe up to quickly access Google Search/Now and double slide down from top (swipe once, then again) for the Quick Toggle menu and easy access to settings. Add-ons like Nova Launcher can give you more gesture oriented stuff like swiping/tapping the home screen in various ways to perform certain actions. Also, keep everything on Google and maintain your Google account, use Photos, Drive, Keep, Google Contacts, Calendar, etc. You can basically keep most of your personal info, pics, videos, contacts, etc, in sync with Google in real-time for those bad days where something happens and you lose your phone, it breaks, etc. and you can access everything from a PC\n4) Battery life and feature richness are the balance you have to play... Save battery by disabling Google Now, Precise Location services, turning off \"Scanning always available\" for WiFi, turn off or lengthen account syncs, turn down screen brightness, disable Moto Display... All of these will save battery, at the cost of features. TBH, the battery on the Moto G is pretty decent, if it doesn't make it the day for you maybe it isn't the right phone for you, another $50 could get you a Huawei Ascend Mate 2 which has 2-3 times the battery life.\nAs far as cases go, it's no different than iPhone... More expensive isn't necessarily better... Get a decent tempered glass screen protector for under $10 and decent cases run $8-$15, you can spend more or less, and they may work fine... YMMV... if you use Amazon you likely know how to sort by Avg User Reviews, it's the where I usually start.\nBTW, I am forced to use an iPhone for work, I have no choice in the matter, I carry an Android phone and an iPhone everyday and use them both a lot, so I kind of have some incite into this... personally I would NEVER own an iPhone as a personal phone, I would go with a $99 Android bargain basement before using an iPhone as a my personal phone.

Ordered a 1Ram/16GB White Model with engraving on August 5th. Original delivery date was 8/24/15. It sat at order complete for a week so I called yesterday 8/20/15. Sales lady told me it would be delivered on the delivery date and explained they are backordered on parts and for quality purposes that want to ship the best products. I hope that means they applied the stage fright patch. On the Motorola forums they seemed to hint that the new moto g's would have them built in. And that the style and pure will have them. \nDelivery date is now 08/25/15. Lady technically kind of lied and I asked how it would get shipped from china that fast to make it by Monday. It just shipped today according to FedEx tracking. Alright moto said it did yesterday. The information was sent to FedEx yesterday I think that's what they recommend. \nI recommend that too anyone ordering any model especially the 1/16 GB or the white version or any of the back ordered covers or engraving to do this. As soon as the phone is in \"Assembled and Complete\". Call Motorola a day or two later. It seems that some people have gotten theirs shipped sooner or a free accessory out of it. I should have called sooner. Like someone else said I'm going out of town for a month so basically by the time I get back the moto Pure will probably be out. I asked if the delays had anything to do with the moto Pure coming out and asked when it's coming and she wouldn't say anything. That's too be expected. \nSlightly disappointed but I ordered after the 16 GB was backordered and basically the day it became delayed. I meant to order a few days earlier but couldn't press enter yet. Also the engraving might have been the nail in the delay coffin too. But I wanted to see how it looked and since the shells are interchange that's cool.

So in no particular order...\nAquaMail - if you ever have an urge to try another email app, you gotta try this. The best.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d....kman.AquaMail\nGoogle Voice - add a second line, yes, a second phone number, to your phone for free. My wife and I have used this for business numbers for years, it's terrific. Keep your actual cellphone number private. More than just a second number, Google Voice can do lotsa stuff a ordinary cell connection can't. https://www\u200b.google.com/voice\nGoogle Voice - the app, does visual voicemail, etc.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...ps.googlevoice\nVoice Choice - automate how Google Voice dials certain people or groups. Very cool app if you use Google Voice.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...=com.voiceplus\nNova Launcher - There's dozens of launchers but none are better than Nova. Fast, stable, it kills. Really a must-have.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...oilsw.launcher\nFirefox - my go-to browser.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...ozilla.firefox\nSome Utilities:\nGotta have a good file manager. Here's 2 to choose from:\nX-Plore - the best. But the 2-panel UI takes some getting used to. Free and no ads. Add access to cloud storage, networking etc for a small charge.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...atgames.Xplore\nFX File Explorer - also very good and you might like the UI better than X-plore.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...?id=nextapp.fx\nFX Plus adds access to cloud storage, networking, etc.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...=nextapp.fx.rk\nClipper - super-handy clipboard utility. Clipper+ is a nice upgrade.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...ojekti.clipper\nGoogle Drive - you have 15GB free storage on Google Drive included with your Google account. You might as well have access to it.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...roid.apps.docs\nAnd to sync files between your PC and Drive:https://tools.google.com/dlpage/driv...tml?hl=en#eula\nSystem Panel - gives a lot of good information about what's going on with the phone. The free version is good.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...pp.systempanel\nWiFi Analyzer - analyze your WiFi network so you can setup your router to use the strongest channels with the least interference. Maximize speed of everything that connects to your WiFi.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d....wifi.analyzer\nNetwork Connections - utility that lists all the connections the phone is making to the internet. You will be amazed. Tap on a connection for more information, including a map. Cool just to fool around with and can be very useful too.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...ll.connmonitor\nOS Monitor - similar to Network Connections above. An alternative, some difference in functions.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...wral.osmonitor\nPortDroid - another utility that can be useful but is kinda fun just to fool around with. Traceroute is cool, will show a map of where your connection goes to reach its destination. Amazing to see the crazy routes and number of hops it takes to reach a destination.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...pter.portdroid\nLTE Discovery - Good mobile network utility.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...d.ltediscovery\nBackup Utilities:\nMyBackup Pro - one of the first Android apps, tried and true. No PC needed.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...id.MyBackupPro\nHelium - another very good backup utility. Can backup more stuff than MyBackup, but it requires a PC.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...ikdutta.backup\nAdvanced Call Blocker - nice if you have trouble with junk calls or texts.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...d.call.blocker\nOther stuff:\nTheScore - I just like this. But it does have ads.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...obile.thescore\nRelay - Reddit is cool.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...ee.reddit.news\nAndroid since v1.0.

I don't know if we're experiencing the exact same issues with Lollipop but every now and then the phone will hang for a second or two, it can get pretty annoying. Anyway, from a technical standpoint, the 2015 Moto G would be a \"downgrade\" as we lose the stereo speakers, NFC, and move from a 1080p display to a 720p display. But thats certainly not to say that it's not worth some hard consideration, far from it. From what I hear the Moto G is a terrific little device. We must first ask ourselves how we use our devices, whats important to us, and what we're willing to go without.\nPersonally, the lack of NFC does not bother me. I've had NFC for years and never used it in my daily life. The speakers on M8 are no doubt superb for a phone, but anytime I want to watch something or listen to music I almost always use headphones, again not a deal breaker for me. The display however has made me think long and hard about the purchase. I haven't used a 720p display in years and I'm worried it might be too much of a step back for me.\nLikewise there are some things I would consider an upgrade, even from a semi recent flagship like the M8. Chiefly battery life (although it depends on what you do with your device YMMV), and, at least in my opinion, software. I'm a huge fan of stock android which is essentially what you get with the Moto line bar a few truthfully handy apps from Motorola. And let's not forget the cost, $219 is a really aggressive price point for what you're getting. (Yes, I based it off of the higher end model) \nAt the end of the day it all comes down to two questions. How do you use your device and can the device you're looking at meet your expectations? \nBest of luck \nP.S.
