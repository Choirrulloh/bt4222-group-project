I thought it was sporadic, but turns out it is every text I send to anyone, they just don't always say something!\nI use the Google messenger app and Nova Prime. From the research I've done this is usually a problem with the stock message app re-sending the same message as the 3rd party app, and is not isolated to the V30 or LG. \nI've done all the suggestions of disabling permissions and data for the LG app (since they don't let you uninstall it) and tried a different 3rd party app (Textra) without any luck. \nSo I finally give up yesterday and resign myself to having to use the LG app even though I hate it so I stop annoying everyone I text, and it is doing the same thing! \nI'm at the end of my rope on ideas short of totally wiping the phone as a last resort.

Most of them were pretty thick, which adds to the width of the phone.\nWhat I wanted was a very thin TPU case - the sort of case that's so thin you don't know it's there. I just want protection from scratches and minor drops - I don't plan on throwing my phone from tall buildings, so don't want anything bulky. I found a case like this for my S8 (made by Casearmy), but was never able to find one for the V30.

The V30 is already a bit wider than I'd like when using one-handed; I'm not into plus-sized phones. \nSo I eventually gave up with the case idea and looked at the wraps/skins available. Most of the skins available (IQ Shield, Clear Coat, etc.) are poorly designed, with separate little individual pieces that stick all the way around the edges.

Set about installing the tempered glass screen protector i had pre-purchased and noticed a bubble in the top right quadrant. I couldn't smooth it out though. I thought maybe the screen protector was bad, but I removed it and it actually was fine. What I noticed is that screen has a valley over an inch long and because of it, he screen protector won't sit flat on the glass causing thay section to look like there is an air bubble underneath. I hit up T-Mobile and they told me I can return it for a regular V30 because they have no more V30+s available to them.\nSo I'm wondering if this might be because of LG's strategy with the V30S which is said to also have 128GB of storage but also 6GB of ram. I want this phone, but I also want to be able to protect it. I had a V20 and I'm pretty careful with my phones, but I did not immediately put a screen protector on it and ended up with a tiny phantom chip in the screen that was almost unnoticeable except for when your finger ran across it.\nI already registered for the 2 year V30 promise so I guess I'm protected in that manner, but I wanted to see what everyone else's thoughts were. Bear in mind, I've had the Optimus G, G3, G4 and 2 V20s(different carriers). So I have no qualms with LG in general.\nOh, and my wife's V30+ came with a stripe of bad pixels down the screen (stuck white) so there's that I suppose, LOL.

Of course, being a fan of music, I immediately plugged my 32 ohm impedance earbuds into the headphone jack. I will say that it sounded really loud for being a good three to four notches from max volume. Also, toggling on Dolby Atmos definitely makes a difference. \nEven so, the prospect of that quad DAC is still making me consider the V30+ or V30S. The thing is, when I tested my earbuds on the V30, it made no difference to the sound whether the DAC was toggled on or off. I have seen a demo, however, where the DAC does get triggered with headphones of 50+ impedance, and it makes quite a difference.\nI have a few questions, especially for those that have prior experience with HTC BoomSound-enabled phones as well. \nFirst, when I tested my earbuds on an HTC, the sound was fantastic, where you could almost hear every instrument individually, yet it sounds full and rich, with just enough punch of bass, with no distortion at max volume. Would you say that headphone audio from the V30 is similar, on-par, or superior to BoomSound?\nSecond, I consider myself a light user. I don't do anything graphic intensive like gaming, nor am I into photography, other than the occasional point-and-shoot. All I do is talk, text, stream my music, watch YouTube and forum. What kind of battery life (and standby time) can I expect with the V30?\nThird, how is the brightness of the screen in sunlight? Would I have to squint, cup my hand over the screen, or find shade to be able to see it?\nFourth, how much storage is available to the user from both the 64 and 128 GB storage options? I currently have 53 GB free on my 64 GB Nexus 6P, which is plenty, but the V30 has more features and preinstalled apps.\nI want to upgrade at some point, but I don't take spending $1,000+ dollars when all is said and done likely. The way I see it, my options are either the upcoming Note 9, V30 (or V40, depending on what this supposed \"Judy\" phone is), the HTC U12, or whatever Huawei has coming later this year.

Other times the sound would be somewhat lacklustre and I would have to go to 75 volume to even come close to the previous. \nAfter some basic process of elimination I discovered that it was due to the sequence that I connect my headphones.

After having owned both phones now, I can say the Pixel 2 XL does not exhibit this stuttering/lagginess effect when scrolling long articles or timelines. To clarify, the V30 is blazingly quick when opening apps or switching between apps, but it's distractingly frustrating when using some apps such as Plume for Twitter or even when scrolling Applications in the Settings menu. Google must be doing some additional optimization of the OS to improve the performance because spec wise, both the V30 and the Pixel 2 appear to be identical. I've noticed the same stuttering on my girlfriend's Galaxy S8, so LG is not alone. \nI can say the same thing for the cameras. The camera specs of the V30 appear to be equal or even superior to the Pixel 2, yet the Pixel 2 photos are simply stunning compared to the photos from the V30, which were surprisingly disappointing (especially indoors). Whatever optimization Google is doing with their HDR+ processing makes a significant difference.\nReluctantly, I returned the V30 for the Pixel 2 XL. I really liked the size and feel of the hardware of the V30 and the added features of the headphone jack and wireless charging. But I just became increasingly frustrated with the stuttering within apps and the poor low light photos. The Pixel 2 XL is noticeably larger than the V30 and bezels are clunkier, which is disappointing. I don't use headphones that often, so I'm okay with out the headphone jack. And I may not need the wireless charging capability as the battery life of the Pixel 2 XL has been remarkable so far where I haven't needed to top up during the day yet with it (currently over 4 hours SOT with 42% battery life left).\nUltimately, neither phone is perfect, but they're both pretty damn good in their own ways.

Maybe. Maybe not. I will definitely take advantage of my extended warranty and have them swap the battery out for me. I've had great experiences with Hyperion and TrendOn batteries for the G3 and G4.

But go ahead, keep fabricating situations that line-up with your opinion.\nAs for keeping the battery performing well, my one piece of advice: Don't charge it while it's powered on.\nHeat is the #1 enemy of a battery, as it degrades the battery and it's ability to hold a charge. If your phone is on (or worse, being used) while charging, the heat generated will be detrimental. So, 99.5% of the time, I turn my phone off and charge it, typically overnight. Yes, that means wireless charging isn't an option, but I honestly don't care. I lived with wireless charging before it existed, so I'll be fine without it.\nI don't care about charging the phone to 100%, but I make it a point to not let it regularly get below 25% before I charge it.

It gives the best compromise between resolution and light sensitivity and yields the best results across all conditions. As good as the V30 is in bright shots, it's junk in lower light. I have plenty of examples of indoor and night shots of my kids with a V30 that are comically bad...

So sit back, relax and grab a cuppa because you're about to learn something you probably haven't seen before.\nI can understand why one would think a camera with a higher megapixel count would do better than a lower megapixel count. That's because megapixels denote a camera's resolution, with a megapixel being approximately 1 million pixels. It's not hard to know that in theory, a camera with a resolution of 21 million pixels will resolve more detail than a camera with 12 million pixels. It's part of the reason why people seem to think 21MP is undoubtedly better than 12MP.\nHowever, this is a basic fundamental judgement error people often make. Cameras are not always about one parameter (in this case, resolution or megapixel count). Instead, they're more about multiple factors such as;Lens quality: The quality of the lens denotes how sharp an image could be, especially around corners, and good quality lenses will have less artifacts such as fringing and chromatic aberrations.Sensor size: The actual size of the camera's image sensor.Pixel size: The actual size of each individual photodiode. This relates to MP count and sensor sizeDSP: Known as a digital signal processor, this is the stuff that makes the automatic wizardry in your camera work.Processing: How a camera processes a RAW file from the sensor into a compressed JPG matters since techniques differ from manufacturer to manufacturer.Aperture f-stop: Denotes how big an aperture is in relation to a camera's focal length. Do note that an aperture of f/1.8 is not universally similar since it differs in relation to the focal length of a camera.Stabilization: Helps stabilize a shot in order to reduce blurriness or increase exposure times in non-ideal lighting environments. Can either be optical or digital.\nThese aren't everything that makes a camera, but they're among the most critical.\nNow, back to this.Let's take the V30's 16MP main camera and dissect it for a bit.\nThe V30's main camera sensor is an Exmor IMX351, a backside-illuminated CMOS image sensor with an effective resolution of approximately 16MP on a 4:3 aspect ratio. On paper, that sounds fine, but here's the kicker. The sensor size is among the smallest on any flagship phone, at a mere 1/3.1\", and as a result, the sensor size is probably the smallest, at 1 micron. For comparison, the iPhone X is around 1.22 microns, the Huawei Mate10 is 1.25 microns on its main camera, and the Pixel 2 XL, Galaxy Note8, HTC U11 and a Moto G5+ pack 1.4 micron pixels and have the largest sensors in this lot (1/2.6\" vs 1/2.9\" on the Huawei, 1/3\" on the iPhone and 1/3.1\" on the V30).\nAt first glance, that doesn't seem too big right? Like what does pixel and sensor size have to do? Well, quite a lot actually, moreso than megapixels.\nThe job of a photodiode is to capture light and resolve that light info into digital data that can be processed by the DSP into a suitable JPEG (although one can skip the JPEG processing if one wants to edit the RAW files in Lightroom). Here's where the problem lies. Smaller photodiodes are less capable of sensing light, and when they're packed so closely together, there is a tendency for them to \"bounce around\" or crosstalk, sometimes causing patches of weird color noise that you see in some RAW shots taken in very low light. While this problem isn't as noticeable in daylight, the smaller photodiode size also means they're more likely to be \"flooded\" with patches of higher exposures in contrast to lower ones. Which is why you sometimes see blowouts in highlights, mainly due to the photodiodes' limited ability to resolve detail. It also bears mentioning that because they're less capable of sensing light, the ISO would have to be jacked up as well, increasing luminance noise.\nSo in your particular case, I'd wager that the 16MP sensor wouldn't immediately be a clear victor, mostly because the noise-reduction has to work extra hard to curb some of the increased noise levels due to the smaller photodiodes caused by a combination of a higher resolution on a smaller sensor. The f/1.6 aperture can help but it serves more to balance out the drawbacks. If anything, the output probably won't be much different from that produced by a U11 or Note8.\nReason why most of the OEMs seem to have stuck with 12MP is because on the limited size on phone sensors, 12MP offers a good balance of detail, noise, dynamic range and luminance. It's also why companies have stopped chasing for more pixels and have instead looked to either dual-camera solutions or increasingly sophisticated post-processing techniques via computational means, with a famous example being Google's HDR+, popularized by the 2016 Pixels and recently made their way onto more phones with the help of XDA. \nIt's also worth noting that this isn't a problem on actual cameras due to their actual size. They pack massive sensors, so it is possible to cram in a ton of pixels without compromising on the actual shot. I'm not kidding when I say a Sony Alpha a7R Mark III is better at actual photo output than a Pixel 2 XL almost solely due to its sensor since it is bigger, has a higher resolution all while packing in significantly larger pixels. Phone cameras don't share this luxury due to limited space, so it's always a balancing act.\nTL;DR version: MP doesn't matter as much now. That 16MP moon shot probably wouldn't look much different on a Pixel 2 XL.", "time": "01-31-2018 06:08 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6150997", "text": "Do you know why cropped pictures look blurry with 12MP as opposed to the 16MP?

They have to apply heavy noise reduction and sharpening to clean it up. It does ok with static images with defined borders and even coloring.. but textures and subtle details get absolutely clobbered.\nI spent a good three weeks obsessively testing the V30's camera and in the situation you describe, it did well. Defining text like you say, is a function of the processing rebuilding those hard areas of contrast. But there's a flip side to all that.\nOne of my test pictures I often used is a printed calendar pinned to a wall by my desk. It does an excellent job of testing a cameras detail and resolving ability. When I pointed the V30 at it, I got will defined text and a nice, noise free image.\nBut I also lost reality. I take that same picture with my 2XL and I do, indeed, get sightly less crisp definition on the letters. But what I do see is texture... The subtle mottled look of the printer paper, the slight variation in ink of the letters... The depth of the threads on the fabric covering the cube walls. These are all details that are all but gone with the V30. The paper is a solid white, uniform text, digital artifacts where I saw weave in the fabric.\nTaking pictures in my house I can see similar differences when looking at walls... Imperfections in the paint on the walls where I didn't bother to sand after priming are nowhere to be seen on the V30, but still persevered on my Pixel.\nSo yes, the V30 can be sharper, but what you are looking at in that image isn't what you shot.. all the warmth is lost. That little, solitary freckle near the corner of my son's mouth... Gone, wiped away when the noise reduction hammer fell.\nThat's why the Pixels keep scoring so high... Even though they may be a little softer, maybe with a little more noise, but they look real...

It's there when it's off, it's there when it's on, but you have to tilt the phone around at special angles to get that gleam and shift.\nSurface Pro 3 and 4 are similar in this respect as well.\nThe IPS on my LG tablet has a similar gleam to it as well at certain angles, but not quite as noticeable as it is on my phone. It's there when it's off, it's there when it's on, and you have to tilt around for it, too.\nMy v30 has yet a slightly different gleam to it at similarly specific angles and it's there when it's on and it's there when it's off and once again, you have to really tilt and angle your head to see it. Unlike with IPS LCD, however, it's not a rainbow. For me, it is literally a bit of a gleam in terms of shift.\nAfter looking at the things that I own, my conclusion is that the / a / any kind of a 'shift' is there, period, on any digital screen and especially on screens with a 'glossy' finish.\nThat said, being that the v30 series is a multimedia-geared phone, in my opinion, any minor 'shift' is simply a part of it. Not a side effect. A part.\nHere's why:\nI'm very blue light sensitive and so by virtue, I'm also (cool) white light sensitive. I hate driving in the dark because everyone has their white lights blasting on via high beams and in comparison, my bedroom with its warm white lighting is a cave.\nI'm also a traditional paper and pencil artist and that means sitting at a desk under a 'pure' and cooler white lighting because any other lighting distorts color perception. I also do graphic design which means that my computer screen display needs to be as 'pure' as possible as well which means cooler white lighting.\nThe v30 is, amongst other things, a phone designed for the arts. It's meant to display colors as pure as possible and it's meant to do it right here and right now and the only way to do it is with a more 'pure' cooler white lighting.\nIf I take a photo right now and with Comfort View off, what I see is what I get and that's that. If I need to adjust, I can do it on the fly without having to worry that I'll see something different later on when I change devices or if I print.\nThe phone gives us the option of Comfort and at this point - especially now that I've had a chance to work with photos, other graphics, and videos - I really have to believe that there was a specific purpose in that decision and that it is related in part to what we're discussing right now.\n(And no, in my experience, the phone actually does not make things more blue in general in spite of the cool lighting.

I had no such signs or any wear and tear on the front or back. So I can reasonably assume that this is new.\nThe blue tint was noticeable before I changed modes, which is why I had to change it. And yes, even a slight tilt causes part of the screen to change colour. But as you say, this is a common phenomenon in OLED displays, and yes, I know it's pronounced in mine, but while watching videos or pics, it isn't noticeable that much. Maybe I would grow accustomed to it and learn to live with it, since going through the replacement procedure with Amazon is a pain in itself as I have experience of it!!\nI still haven't inserted a SIM in it and started using it as my daily driver, as I first want to layer it with protection front and back, and only then would I take it outside the house!! So signal strength is not the issue. I am just connecting it to the home wifi and using it to just watch videos or browse the net. So the dip in battery is all due to the processes going on inside it.\nThe intermittent waking up is not regular. For some charging sessions, it does not do that, while at other times, it's doing that. I would have to charge it some more times to get a pattern. I see your point, though, as I had set it on charge while the setup was going on and the waking could have been just due to an installation being completed. I would have to ask though: does this phone have such a feature where it would chirp and wake up constantly until you viewed a new notification?\nLastly, let me take your advice and use it for some more days before judging on its battery life since with this sporadic use, (i.e. I just use it for some time before leaving for work and then after coming back from work), the battery is still at 65% after 2 days (it arrived the day before yesterday when I charged it to 100%), and seems pretty solid.", "time": "02-20-2018 11:39 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6168691", "text": "If the battery drain continues, see what happens if you boot into Safe Mode: https://support.sprint.com/support/t...dvc10980015prd", "time": "02-21-2018 05:29 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "line Down the Misdle of Screen", "thread": [{"postID": "post6165998", "text": "Man been waiting for an upgrade for a while to get this phone.

The ONLY app that can play PCM, DSD and MQA to the full potential of the ES9218P DAC is the stock LG player.\n2. The stock player interface is very poor and limited but the quality of audio output is excellent\n3. MQA files need to end in .flac or .wav extension for the stock player to play them correctly\n4. Most players still use an older Android API for querying the abilities of the DAC. This only allows one DAC to answer and it is always the Qualcomm DAC, not the Sabre DAC. This results in the app decimating and converting all audio to 48khz PCM even when the phone does output via the Sabre DAC.\n5. The new FIR filters interface does a capable job of smoothing out digital ringing.\n6. High Bitrate music files placed on the new Sandisk 400GB high-speed MicroSD card were played perfectly\nOther music players tried:\n1. USB Audio Player Pro\n2. Onkyo HF Player\n3. Black Player\n4. HiBY Music\n5. Google Music Player\n6. Amazon Music Player\n7. Tidal\n8. PowerAmp\n9. VLC\n10. Foobar2000\n11. Pi Music Player\n12. jetAudio HD Music Player\n13. Neutron Music Player\n14.

I ask because I stream my tunes from there.\nSecond, does the unlocked V30+ supposed T-Mobile band 4? I've seen conflicting info where band 4 support is listed on some, but not all sites. On the T-Mobile site proper, it does list support, but only 2-3G support while roaming.\nThird, how's the screen brightness at max, in sunlight? Is it visible, or must you squint or find shade? Has LG addressed the issues with screen uniformity?\nFourth, how is battery life, including stand by time on the V30/+? For instance, on my 6P, if I unplug at 100% at bedtime, I lose about 2-3% at night. \nThe way I see it, my options to upgrade are either the V30/+, the HTC U12, or the Galaxy S9+. I love HTC's BoomSound audio cause it sounds great, even with my current 32 ohm earbuds, but I'm wary about going to LCD over AMOLED. I know the S line is supposed to come with stereo speakers \"tuned by AKG\", but I have no experience with a device \"tuned by AKG\", so I don't know if the audio experience would even compare to that of the V30/+ or HTC, even with Samsung's bundled AKG earbuds. Does anyone here have experience with all three, that can compare the sound of LG's DAC with BoomSound and AKG through an ear/headphone?\nI suppose another option I have would be to wait for LG's supposed V30+ Alpha. I don't care about AI, and I don't take any detailed photos other than the occasional point-and-shoot. I also don't do anything graphic intensive. Even so, I'd hope any upgraded V30 would come with the latest internals, including the SD 845 and a higher capacity battery, because, why not?\nApologies for the long-winded post, but since I'm due for an upgrade and I plan on keeping my next device for two years, I'd like to be as informed as possible if I am to part with $1000 when all is said and done.

The DAC only works on sound coming from the phone, not for sound going into the phone, so it makes no difference to the person you're talking to. (And a decent equalizer, like Precise Volume (+ EQ/Booster) can do wonders for even a phone without decent receive audio [I'm extremely hard of hearing, and it makes phone calls a pleasure again.].)\n2. How strong the carrier's signal is (or the Wifi signal is on T-Mobile Wifi calls or Hangout Dialer calls) is a lot more important to call quality than the phone. Although Verizon covers more people than the other 3 carriers, it doesn't cover more area, so if you happen to be in an area with bad coverage, your calls are going to be noisy, \"go digital\" (which, on Verizon or Sprint means they'll sound as if you were under water), etc.\nAlways choose the carrier first, based on the coverage in the spots you need coverage (and, if you need coverage in an entire city, drive around for a day with your new phone and carrier and check out loads of spots all over the place), then choose from the phones that will work with that carrier. Choosing the phone first, then choosing a carrier that sells that phone (which is what a lot of people do) leaves a lot of people complaining about the phone when it's really the coverage that's causing the problem.\nAs for a lot of loud background noise, no phone is designed to handle that. Some hands-free devices (both Bluetooth and wired) handle it better than others, but with devices coming into the market and going off the market so rapidly, you have to find a store that will let you return the device if it doesn't block background noise (Walmart is pretty good with that, and has a pretty good selection, and the same is true of Amazon), so that you can find one that does. My Motorola 850 (Bluetooth) does a pretty decent job, but it hasn't been sold in years. What looks like its replacement (which hasn't been sold in years either), the 720, can pick up a shout from a block away. So you really have to try them.

It's not restricted to a single app. I have tried disabling battery optimization for a couple of apps (Life360 and GroupMe) but they both still suffer from this problem - notifications of incoming messages (GroupMe) and notifications of left/arrived home (Life360) often don't come in until I hit the power button to wake the phone.\nI'm not sure if there is an OS component that also needs to be exempted from battery optimizations.

Upgrading from V20, which was upgraded from a V10.\nI am mad at the world for not demanding features like removable battery and IR blaster. The second screen is NOT replaced with this floating widget, especially because it does not have recent apps. That was my primary use for the second screen. Just like it was on the note Edge I used to have. I would have preferred if they kept the phone phablet sized with these minimal bezels. I didn't want a smaller phone.\nWith that out of the way, I love this phone. The screen looks great. Let's hope it doesn't get burn in like my Samsung phones did. I spend about 1-2 hours in my car every day, and my screen is always on Waze during that time. I like the peace of mind of having a water resistant phone. I have not played around too much with the camera yet, but it's definitely snappier. \nMy girlfriend has a G6 and she is already jealous of some of the little things the V30 has that hers doesn't. Like the screen off functionality of being able to turn on the flashlight, Wi-Fi and such.\nAll the themes in LG Smart world that my girlfriend could get on her G6 seem to finally be available for this V30, such as Golden Elephant 2, which I suppose was somehow not compatible with the V20 aspect ratio.\nI actually prefer the way the G6 feels in the hand. Build quality and materials on both V30 and G6 are top notch, but I prefer the smoother edges of the G6. The V30 had a sharp edge where the glass and metal meet. The V20 was too slippery.\nI use the manual controls with the audio gains on the V20 all the time, as I go to alot of concerts. I can't wait to see how the V30 fares when it uses the earpiece as mic under loud volume. I like how the wide angle camera has less distortion and better resolution, but it comes at the expense of giving up a bit of the wide angle range. \nI hope the reviewers are correct they this phone does not slow down over time, because the V20 sometimes crawled, making me miss photo and video opportunities. The only way to get my V20 fast again was to factory reset. \nI like the quick facial recognition, but I'm so used to fingerprint unlock already. Let's see if my usage changes as a result. \nNow here's the problem. I woke up today and found the phone at 65% charge. The same QC 3.0 charger I used for my V20. Yesterday when I got the phone it charged fine. Now today even with the supplied charger it doesn't even hit 400mA charge rate according to Ampere. I took it to work (Fry's Electronics) and tried the phone with many different combinations of wireless chargers, powerbanks and cables. Turns out the phone does not even want to quick charge now. And it does not like any powerbank OR car charger at all, charging very slowly. I did notice last night on the vehicle QC 3.0 quick charger the phone was losing battery level while navigating. \nThis is not the way I wanted to move over to a sealed battery phone, after having 9 generations of phones with removable batteries and standalone spare chargers. I'm going to the AT&T store to see about swapping the phone out and calling this an unfortunate coincidence as I have seen no widespread reports of charging issues.\nUpdate:\nAfter they tried to charge me a $45 restocking fee at the AT&T corporate store I bought my last 4 phones from, I went to a different store yesterday morning and they swapped me out. This phone now charges properly.\nThis is making it hard for me to have faith in LG, because my girlfriends G6 had to be sent in for bad memory last month, and my V10 before my V20 had the bootloop.

If you need OS updates 3-4 months earlier than other devices just so you can feel special about yourself, get the Pixel. Or if you plan on keeping the phone for longer than two years and you want that extra year of support, then the Pixel will be a good buy.\nAnything the Pixel does, with its stock version of Android, the V30 can also do. What the Pixel has over the V30 is supposedly a better a camera and front firing speakers. If having the best camera is more important than having a complete package with a good camera, then get the Pixel. Neither camera is bad and, coming from the V10, either is an update for you. Both will be good cameras.\nIf you're the kind of person who consistently listens to audio through your phone's speaker, then maybe the Pixel might be good for you. If wired/wireless headphones, BT speakers, casting your device, or just using another device with a larger screen to consume media at home doesn't work for you, maybe front firing speakers will.\nThe last reason to get a Pixel is if you're absolutely against OEM skins. Coming from the V10, I don't think you are. I'm a long time LG user and I've grown accustomed to their skin and it gets better with every new phone. Honestly, it's not that different from stock despite what people will have you believe. The most notable difference is the theme, which can be changed because LG includes that kind of feature with their skin, unlike boring stock Android that Google dishes out.\nIn person, the Pixel 2 XL looks kind of awkward to me. The larger bezels with the rounded screen corners just doesn't look right. It looks off, weird. The V30, on the other hand, looks great and feels great. Best in hand feel of any phone I've held. The only thing I like about the Pixel build over the V30 is that it weighs more. The V30 is very thin and very light. This, of course, is a personal preference. \nAside from that, the V30 is a more complete package. When it comes to the software, the Pixel isn't unique. The Pixel has Android, but completely stock. The V30 also has Android, but has more features baked in. It has a very useful wide angle camera. It has wireless charging.

Both pixel models had better speakers than the v30. Of course the pixels will get updates sooner. Interface (GUI) was better on google phones but put a custom launcher on and that problem is solved. Screen on xl was not good at all. Colors were faded and muted no matter what setting i put it on. Regular pixel had a berrter screen IMO. V30 looks better than both pixels. Screen is much better on v30 (No banding or fading on my v30 at all)....screen is perfect. No micro sd card support on pixel 2's. No wireless charging or hi fi dac on pixels. Glad i got the v30 over the pixel models...If u want better speakers and a slightly better auto mode camera than i suggest you get regual pixel 2 over the XL.

It's over if the things LG uses to improve durability.

Yes the V30 has manual controls, but those manual controls are just an app download away. There's no wide angle camera in the P2, and that thing is slick, but it all depends on your usage. I would much rather have a single camera that's better across all scenarios that a dual.\nThe V30's display is more vibrant, at least now, Google is going to up the saturation on their displays shortly. And I also have a sneaking suspicion that LG used better QC for their own phone... \nYou can't go wrong with either phone. It all depends on the secondary features.

It has buttery smooth performance and an amazing camera, with the big drawback being it's boring brick like design and huge bezels. I had just assumed all year my next phone would be the Pixel 2 XL, but then LG had to go and drop the V30 on us and I knew after reading all the early reviews after IFA that I was going to like it. \nAs soon as it finally made it to the local Verizon store I went in to see one and I was instantly smitten with it. IMO, the V30 has the best hardware of any phone made to date! The slim bezels, the glass and metal build, the weight, the dual cameras, the waterproofing, the wireless charging, the headphone jack - it's amazing how much they packed into a phone that fits and feels so well in hand!\nI decided to wait until the Pixel 2 XL hit the stores and after trying it out it only confirmed how much I prefer the hardware of the V30. The Pixel 2 XL is barely an improvement over last years model in that it is till a big boring design with way too big of bezels for a current flagship phone. But darn if Google didn't continue and even enhance the buttery smooth operation and the camera even further! \nI'm still torn because I still really like the hardware and customization options of my V30. I'm still smitten with how it looks and feels in the hand and I have had a ton of fun customizing it with various themes and launchers and apps and such. But the camera is a huge disappointment given it's specs. My year old Pixel XL takes noticeably better pictures in all situations, at least in auto mode. I have been able to get better pics out of the V30 when using manual mode, but still not to the quality of the pics out of my Pixel XL, darn it. Conversely, the wide angle camera on the V30 has been fun to use and obviously offers some unique shots you simply can't get out of the Pixel (or any other phone for that matter). The other thing that has frustrated me with the V30 is the stuttering and lagginess when scrolling timelines or long web pages. It's visibly noticeable and frequently distracting, darn it. My year old Pixel never had that problem and every app and webpage scrolls smoothly. I've even tried tweaking some of the developer options as recommended here, but nothing seems to help. As some folks mention, it must be something with how LG is throttling the CPU to save battery. And it's not unique to the V30 as my girlfriend's S8 does the same thing. It just shows how good Google is at optimizing the software of their phones. And camera. \nSo, that's pretty much what it has come down to for me. Do I stay with all the amazing hardware features and great feel of the V30, while living with a less than stellar camera and some distracting lags when using apps? Or do I switch to a phone that is buttery smooth and produces phenomenal photos with no effort, but looks and feels like large brick in hand?

GIF's on the fly!!! \nThe LG V30+ \u2018Floating Bar\u2019 gives you quick access to various tools for multi-tasking and easy launching into productivity apps \u2013 like Screen capture, Shortcuts, Music player, Calendar and Quick contacts (and more).\nBut what you may not have noticed is if you\u2019re watching a video and you open the \u2018Floating Bar\u2019 you\u2019ll also gain the ability to take a GIF!\nFirst \u2013 if you don\u2019t have the floating bar accessible, it\u2019s easy to enable.Swipe down from your Notifications BarGo to your Settings menuGo to General SettingsTap on the Floating BarTurn on Floating bar\nYou can add/remove apps from your Floating bar by opening the floating bar on your home screen and clicking the settings cog within. You can scroll through apps on the bar, so don\u2019t be fooled into thinking you only have the few there by default\n**The GIF option doesn\u2019t show unless you\u2019re watching a video of some sort!\nNow, while watching a YouTube video (for example) open the side menu on your phone.\nIf you\u2019re in full screen landscape mode you\u2019ll have to tap one of the sides (top or bottom) to get your menus to open. You\u2019ll also see the floating bar. Just tap on the floating bar and then tap on \u2018GIF\u2019. \nYou can pause a video, set up the section you want to take a GIF of and then press play on the video and the red \u2018record\u2019 button.\nIt\u2019s really that simple. The video ends up in your gallery under the \u2018GIF Capture\u2019 heading.\nMy biggest problem is getting a GIF the right size to SMS to someone or figuring out how to place one on the web that\u2019s in action.\nI\u2019m a New York Rangers hockey fan\u2026 figured I\u2019d mention that before I share my video where I was looking at some of the most wicked slap shots in hockey and came across Shea Weber.\nSo, using the instructions above, I was able to grab a gif of this slo-mo of Shea taking a heck of a shot!\nCheck out the link below! \nSLAP SHOT GIF -https://plus.google.com/u/1/photos/p...LGe_pqzpNfokgE\nAlso, I realize some people don\u2019t like the floating bar because it gets in the way of things or you might accidentally open it at times. You can easily move the floating bar by holding down on the arrow on your home screen and sliding it up or down or across your screen to a more suitable place.\nHave questions about using the LG V30+ ?

I was happy with the OP but a few niggles coupled with really missing wireless charging and an always on display prompted me to give the V30 a try.\nObservations so far:\nFeels really light and I\u2019m not sure if I like this or not. \nThe blue shift is there and I am noticing it. Not sure if it is because I was aware and looking for it but I do see it on apps with a white background (i.e. email or messages). The OP5t screen is lower res but IMO is actually better. Maybe I have an older build device? Not sure if this is typical as I have seen Pixel 2 XLs with massively different shifts so it may be worth a support ticket to LG?\nNot noticed the black crushing yet but have not really been looking for it. Brightness on auto\nFace unlock is an odd one\u2026. with the standard setup you still have to wake the phone to use it and the best way to wake the phone is to press the power button. This seems logical until you realise the power button is also the FPS so it begs the question if you have to press the FPS to activate face unlock, why bother? I have changed this now to work when the screen is off and it is ok but nowhere near as quick as the OP5ts face unlock. I am actually thinking of switching this off anyway as FPS is just quicker and more secure.\nRaise to wake would be nice, I really like this on the iPhone and OP. I do prefer the always on display so would not trade, having both would be nice though!\nAudio (headphones) is excellent\nStandby battery performance is decent. I remember the G6 being iPhone esque on standby and the V30 feels the same so far\nMore bloat than the oneplus, less bloat than a Samsung but it seems that since I had the G6 that package disabler apps have stopped working?? May have to look into disabling via adb as there is some stuff on there I\u2019d like to lose\nNova launcher mitigates most of the ugliness of the LG skin but it cannot do anything about the settings menu which is IMO horrible and a little laggy, the dreaded LG app switcher lag is also still there, albeit slightly better than the G6 (probably due to the newer processor)\nPerformance is otherwise fine, feels faster than an S8 but slower than the OP5t and P2. Getting a working package disabler may help with this\nOverall as you can probably tell I am not 100% sold on it but as car phone warehouse returns policy is not great I will persevere. I do prefer the performance and speed on the OP5t but the V30 feels a better overall device and as I am done with Samsung it is other than the pixels probably the best android device currently available even if it is definitely flawed.", "time": "12-11-2017 08:16 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6106432", "text": "V30 = better hardware (wide angle cameras, F1.6 lens, quad DAC), more features\nOP5t = closer to stock Android experience.

The V30 is an excellent phone. While I am partial to LG (having had much better luck with them than Samsung), I ended up on the GS8+. Although the form factor and location of the fingerprint sensor are inconvenient, I have adjusted this time. As for the V30, every feature seemed on par with the Samsung galaxies. In fact I would say I preferred it because of the more convenient location of the fingerprint sensor, camera options (e.g., widescreen shots), knock code (something so simple, but I absolutely love it), voice unlock and face unlock. It was great having ALL those options available at the same time (with Samsung, you cannot use face unlock AND iris recognition at the same time). Battery life for the V30 was fantastic. The color shift when looking at the display was there, but: 1) it's there with the Samsung phones too and 2) I didn't notice it after a while. Yes, the display is a notch below Samsung. But honestly, I didn't notice. When staring at it, I just thought it was fantastic. The V30 camera is excellent. \nSo why did I choose the GS8+? I had bluetooth problems with both V30s I used. I experienced static during calls (yeah, I still use my phone for calls. Weird, I know). This was not an issue with any other phone I used this year (I also used the G6 and the Samsungs I list above). When my second V30 had the same problem and I could only find one other person on line reporting the issue, I realized it was likely a compatibility issue with my car's bluetooth audio. Although the static issue seems unique to me, it seems to be one that I will continue to experience with the V30, so I decided against a third attempt at the phone. That being said, the V30 is an outstanding phone. As is the S8+ (and I can deactivate Bixby. Soo thrilled at that).

The S8+ indeed has a better single camera, both front and rear. However, the V30 has a 16MP so when you zoom/crop, you can see more detail and it's something I notice (but some people don't). Also the V30 has a useful wide angle camera, very fun to use. The microphone is much better since they have 3 microphones on it and video recording software is more advanced. The DAC is a plus, music sounds much better and clearer, it's noticable. I'm not biased because I've been using Samsung phones for many years including the S8+.

I'm looking at this as a potential enhancement to what I think are already great pictures. \nI have Graphy installed, though as much as I love the idea of Graphy I always get a message telling me I'm over or under exposed. I thought the idea was to select a similar image and use the settings the original photographer used. It's weird because I choose an outside daytime Graphy while I'm outside taking a daytime picture and the entire screen will darken, tell me I'm underexposed and need to adjust ISO. I assumed Graphy was doing that work for me. \nI downloaded the free version of adobe lightroom to my phone. I took a 'RAW' picture of a Christmas tree. I was surprised to see the JPEG that came out was clearer than the RAW... and that the 'RAW' also didn't include the zoom I had on the tree.\nI did open the RAW in free Android lightroom, cropped and edited, but really have no idea what the heck I'm doing.

I usually have a minimum speed in mind to handle my hands and any subject motion.\nI then adjust the ISO to get the desired brightness I want, which may or may not be what the camera recommends.\nKnowing that I am going to edit the photo, I usually just go with the auto white balance in the camera then fix it in the edits later if needed. This is an easy fix for DNG files, very hard for JPG files.\nSoftware editing:\nAll my pictures (phone and DSLR) get processed. On what device and using what software depends on the use of the photo.\nDSLR pics and important phone pics gets processed in Lightroom Classic on my PC.\nOther phone pics get processed on the phone using either \"snapseed\" or \"photoshop express\".\nIf you are going to do a large crop, do it first to get rid of the stuff you don't want to see.\nFix the white balance first. This makes all other edits much easier.\nMost people like warmer (yellowish) to cooler (bluish), but don't go crazy.\nIf you are going to do a curves adjustment (good for large exposure problems) do it next.\nAdjust the highlights and shadows, whites and blacks before adjusting the \"brightness\".\nAdjust the \"brightness\" which tends to affect the midrange most.\nAdjust the vibrance before adjusting the saturation.\nAdjust the \"clarity\", but gently.\nAdjust the contrast last.\nNoise reduction: you need much less then you think. No one sees your image at 100% zoom. The size reduction needed to print or view on the screen naturally eats a lot of noise to start with.\nSharpening: go gently, creating halos is bad. \nIf your software allows for masking, set it really high, like 80/100.

In some other sports you can follow the player (or horse, in racing) and get a clear shot of the subject with the background blurry. You can try bracing against something solid and following the player with the puck, but the stick and puck will still be blurred unless the shutter speed is high enough.There are two types of picture, raster and vector. Raster is little blocks, and if you zoom in post production, the blocks just get larger, so the quality goes down. And RAW is a raster format. (A vector format is just a description - from here, in this color to there. If you zoom, the length in the description changes but the quality doesn't. But cameras use raster images.)

It\u2019s weird to me that some people would refute the fact that this camera is so good. The pictures I\u2019m taking are (to me) better than my high quality Nikon camera.\nAnyway, with social media being what it is and your pictures & media available to all to poach without giving proper credit to the photographer (you) it brings me great pleasure to introduce you to the \u2018Signature\u2019 feature built into the LG V30+ Camera software.\nSo, this blog is really a mishmash ofa couple of things... \nFirst, I post a quite a few pictures on social media. Most days there\u2019s a picture from my morning jog down the East side of Manhattan. Lately it\u2019s been more \u2018pre-dawn\u2019 with the move to daylight savings. \nI recently had a comment from a photographer friend on Facebook asking me what camera I\u2019ve been using to post my photos as she\u2019s looking to replace her DSLR. Yeah, she likes the pictures I\u2019ve taken with the LGV30+ enough to think about replacing her DSLR camera\u2026 THAT says a lot about the quality of these pictures. OK - perhaps it's not 'as good' as a DSLR as my title states, but to many people, this is definitely close enough. When I saw her post I literally smiled from ear to ear. \nI\u2019m not a heavy user of \u2018filters\u2019 as most times when I find inspiration in something worth shooting I want to grab the true natural colors. Not that I'm against using them from time to time. Still one of the things I love about the LG V30+ Camera is the colors are true/real life. It\u2019s not augmented or affected by the software or lens like some other flagship devices. If I want to add the filters myself, they\u2019re easily accessible. The photo of the Williamsburg Bridge, NY is on 'Auto Mode' with no filters... You can view the settings on Flikr. \nThe photo my friend commented on is below\u2026 and a full HD version is available here \u2013Williamsburg Bridge Full HD Picture on Flikr \nWilliamsburg Bridge - FB\nThe other thing I wanted to note is the \u2018signature\u2019 on the bottom right of the picture. Basically you can set a \u2018watermark\u2019 (signature) on your pictures to ensure you\u2019re identified as the rightful owner of your work. Sure\u2026 people can still borrow shamelessly from your photos and photoshop them, etc\u2026 but, this makes it a little bit harder while making your amazing pictures even more personal.\nTo add a signature to your pictures open the Camera App > Click the Settings Cog in the upper left corner > Scroll to \u2018Signature\u2019 and click the 3 dots > Type in your signature and choose your font and click \u2018ADD\u2019.\nTip \u2013 the keyboard pops up and covers up some of the additional font options. Shrink the keyboard down to see the additional fonts.\nTip 2 \u2013 you can view a sample of your Signature at the top of the screen over a picture of tulips.\nAfter you click \u2018Add\u2019 you\u2019ll be brought back to the settings screen. Just make sure \u2018Signature\u2019 is set to on and you\u2019re all set. From here on out you\u2019ll have your signature on all of your photos. \nSignature Settings\nAdding a Signature\nAdditional Fonts\nThat's' all I've got for now. Got some great pictures? Feel free to share them here. \nQuestions about the LG V30+? ask away... \nUntil next time - Have a GREAT Holiday Season! \nAs part of a device ambassador program I have the glorious opportunity to test out multiple devices by multiple manufacturers and write my opinions. I am not an employee of a device manufacturer and I do not speak on behalf of any mobile carriers.

I've left both on in the background and when I later checked my battery usage after, Chrome was the undisputed leader in both battery draining and memory hogging with Google Play Store right behind.\nEven Skype which is notorious in any format for being a vampire wasn't that bad and I was texting like mad on it during the same time and when I wasn't, it was also in the background.\nMy solution was to disable background activities as much as I can along with data usage (I personally don't have anything related to either of the two that needs constant background refreshing or data usage) and it helped.\nIf you can get into Battery Usage, you can actually click on all of the listed apps and/or features and/or functionalities and do a compare and contrast.\nA tip that I was told when I was struggling to figure out why my Android tablet's screen kept turning on by itself was to check for any apps that are 'Keep Awake' when they don't necessarily need to be.\nI checked the apps/features/functions in my V30 that were the top offenders and wouldn't you know?

Chrome is a resource hog for me and I seldom if ever need it to run in the background and so I'm very aggressive in making sure it uses as little resources (including data) as possible. \nThat said, I hope that helps and as some suggestion: if you've updated any apps lately, give them a looksee to see if any of your settings might have changed - especially if you use any particular clock, alarm, or nighttime-related settings.\nAutomatic app updates might also be contributing; for me, I've had it set so that it will update apps through Wi-Fi only... but if I let them auto-update, too, I might have apps updating throughout the night while I sleep because at home, I'm on Wi-Fi.\nI agree with tardus; if it still isn't making sense, post a screenshot of the Battery Usage screen and maybe we can help troubleshoot.", "time": "12-08-2017 04:43 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post6100622", "text": "Thanks Aithan, When I go to battery & power and tap on battery usage my details says \"Battery usage data not available\" How do I get this to show me what you see?

You then took another month to release it in the US. It took you till end of November to release it in Germany.\nWe here in Austria, bordering Germany, might not be the biggest market, but our 9 mil people are statistically using 3 phones per person. Austria is also a reference market for mobile Technology. UMTS and LTE were first tested here and our network coverage is one of the best world wide, as well as the wonderfully low rates for speech and data (I pay 13,- \u20ac for 3000 min speech, 3000 SMS and unlimited data - 17GB full speed LTE).\nSo yes, maybe we're not the biggest market. Maybe were not known so well and not so much in your Focus, LG. But believe me, due to your ridiculous marketing, you aren't in our focus that much either - and from what I hear, you're not that much in the focus with your mobile phones anywhere else, too.\nThis, and the fact that it's taking you MONTHS to get your product out in Europe means only one thing: people buy Samsungs S8+ or Note 8, which are significally getting cheaper over time, people buy the Huawei Mate 10 Pro which is a great phone and also cheaper than yours, heck, people might even buy iPhones, which are decent enough and have one big advantage: availability.\nWhat the f*** is the matter with you, LG? Dou you really need to be told, that to earn money you need to sell your sh*t to people? And for people to buy your sh*t you need to offer it to them?\nDangling great products infront of your customers nose without giving them the ability to buy them is complete and utter nonsense.

Holidays are in full effect... especially here in NYC. Thanksgiving has passed and the spirit is flowing. OK, not to make anyone throw up from holiday cheer or anything like that... just sometimes it's good to stop and appreciate the season. \nSo, here's what I'm going to do... Post some of my New York City Holiday Photos and audio clips to show you how awesome they came out with my LG V30+. \nPLEASE feel free to respond with your photo's too! \nI went to the Vienna Boys Choir this past weekend. It's been a holiday tradition for the last 5 or so years. It's so innocent... kids from all around the world together to sing choir music as well as Christmas songs in the greatest music venue in the world - Carnegie Hall.\nThough you're not really supposed to take pictures during the performance, I did sneak in one shot before and two just at the start of the show.\nI also got a few 'concert' recorded tracks with the LG V30+ sitting on my lap.\nWas far up in a box at the back of the theater, so will share my pictures from that vantage and the audio too... just keep in mind the positioning and the fact that I had to be discrete.\nI am SO impressed with the audio recording capabilities of this phone. Seriously, Stereo recording (in concert mode only) with super defined clarity. Sorry it's so quiet though - I was a bit far back as you can see from the pictures and well.. it's not like a Rock Concert that would have been much louder (which I promise to record next).\nEven if it's not your type of music, you have to at least appreciate the innocence of it all. I know, it may not be your thing, but please don't bash...\nFeel free to zoom in (enlarge) on these photos too as you'll see the clarity and definition.\nALL pictures are on Auto-Mode except the one in VR of the tree.\nOne thing I noticed is if you do choose to zoom/enlarge these pictures, the ones that aren't 'zoomed' via the V30+ have a lot more sharpness and clarity than those which we're zoomed via the camera. \n3 Pictures from the Vienna Boys Choir:\n3 Audio Tracks from the Vienna Boys Choir - unedited.

The crowds around the area were insane! You could barely walk because of the number of people taking pictures of Sack's 5th Avenue Windows and of course the tree being right there. So, as not to be like all the rest and block the sidewalk while taking pictures, I snapped 2 super fast shots of the Cathedral and pushed my way along with the rest of the crowd.\nThe colors and background are amazing. If you zoom in on these you'll see it's almost like 3D.\nThis camera is just amazing...\nAnd now the Tree. I took a couple from further back near the sidewalk entrance off 5th, and then squeezed my way right up front.\nI shared these pictures (on the phone) with a couple of friends last night and they were more impressed with the quality of the pictures than of the actual tree. lol\nI probably should mention, I don't know any of the people in these pictures. They just happened to be in the way  haha.\nFirst the VR. This is for those who have always wished they could visit NYC and participate in Rockefeller Center this time of year. \nFor the full 180\u00b0 you may have to go to the link here... \nShould be 180 VR, but not sure how this will show here. Check the link  otherwise. \nAnd then the other Tree Pictures.. \nThis one from the street - notice I focused on the Tree, therefore the people who I had no interest in taking a photo of are blurred.. plus may have been moving. \nI focused on the tree - no idea who these people are heh\nThe next is from the same location, but zoomed over the same folks heads... Killer zoom! \nZoomed in from 5th ave (practically) to the tree. Great Detail for zoom.\n...and the remaining from right up front.. All in Auto Mode \nWide Angle - \n- share some Holiday pictures from your V30+ or any other phone.. and have a very very Happy Holiday Season! \nWant to know more about the LGV30+?

But the camera is the BEST. I\u2019ve had other flagships including some of the top offerings out there that the V30+ is going up against.\nThis beats them all hands down. Not just the wide angle lens, which I find myself using a ton, but also the incorporation of \u2018Graphy\u2019 lens which allows a user to grab the personalized settings used by professional photographers to get the perfect shot. Say for example you\u2019re taking a picture by a stream. You can open \u2018Graphy\u2019 and grab the settings from a pro who took a similar photo of a stream. There\u2019s tons of pictures and settings, and It\u2019s particularly useful for non-pro\u2019s like me to make the best of my pictures.\nThere\u2019s tons of other settings too with incorporated lenses.\nI\u2019m still learning video\u2026 I\u2019ve tried CineView which is really an amazing way to zoom in to a scene, but it\u2019s not always as smooth as I would like.. .perhaps because I don\u2019t do a lot of video I\u2019m not getting it right. This will take some more work for me. Also want to do some 360 video.. #2 Quad DAC \u2013 WOW. OK, so, I\u2019ve been using Bluetooth headphones for a while. I\u2019m using Bose Soundsport. I like the sound and I like the fact that they don\u2019t burn out from sweat during a workout. However, I had to try out the DAC with the included headphones. All I can say is I\u2019ve been missing out on a LOT when it comes to audio quality. Nothing personal against those Bluetooth fans out there\u2026 I\u2019m one of \u2018em. Still, the DAC really makes the music sound so much better and clearer. Not just for streaming music, but my own library sounded 10x better. The space and clarity are like on a HiFi system. Check out Atom Strange, The Lost Cosmonauts album and listen to \u2018Neverwas\u2019. The clarity is stunning. The space in the music is like rediscovering my music collection all over again. Which by the way, the included earbuds sound great!#3 That screen! Back to the pictures I was talking about before? After you snap a pic, make sure you view it on the beautiful 4X HD screen. It\u2019s basically an HDTV in your hands. I\u2019m sort of disappointed after I post pictures to Facebook/Instagram and see them on my computer monitor. The clarity just isn\u2019t the same\u2026 everyone MUST upgrade! Smiley Happy heh\u2026 that\u2019s the only solution.#4 VR Images - More about pictures\u2026 the clarity of VR 180/360 pictures is just beautiful. I\u2019ve uploaded a few here to look at. The colors pop and it\u2019s So easy to use.\nI loaded 2 VR\u2019s, one \u2018food\u2019 pic.. though it\u2019s not \u2018food\u2019 it\u2019s really just my coffee (mug). What I like about it is the mug is the main focus and the background blurs. Very simple to use. I did take a picture of my Huevos Crab Rancheros on auto mode as well as the mustang we used for the weekend.\nAlso, the camera responds lightning fast\u2026 hence the quick picture of Kurt Busch from Homestead Raceway this past weekend.\nVR Images:\nCheck these links out - double click and zoom in... then right/left with the mouse...or VR on your V30 and just turn the device or yourself around.

The unit I received did have the uneven graininess at low light levels and even some lighter vertical stripes. But, being I don't really ever run my phone at low light and always set my phones to a constant (non-auto) brightness I figured it's a non-issue. Then a coworker spotted a tiny light blotch along the edge of the screen. It just made the blotch area slightly lighter in brightness from the rest of the screen but I decided to try an exchange. So I went to the AT&T store today and had it replaced. At the store the new display looked flawless. Been home with it now for some time and it's fully setup and I tested the display again at low light in darkness, from all angles, at varying brightness levels, etc and I can say the replacement unit is flawless. It doesn't exhibit any of the low brightness graininess of the first model and no light banding.\nSo, just wanted to sound off that if you receive a unit with a poor display get it replaced and test the replacement. The problems with the screen appear to be QC or manufacturing issues rather than inherently flawed tech.

For a 6\" screen the phone feels very reasonable. Couple that with the 2/1 aspect ratio and i really enjoy the in hand feel. I admit i really love the feel of the phone without a case. The all glass feels amazing. Unfortunately its glass and being so its more fragile and super slippery. Whether the phone is in my pocket or in my hand is just fantastically slippery.\nBattery. Battery life is subject to how you use your phone and my comparison is to how I've used my past phones. With that said my battery life is phenomenal. Whether its the optimization or the chip (or both) i get amazing battery life at 50% screen brightness\nWith over 20hrs on the battery i can easily get 7hrs screen on time I'd guess a lot more but i charge my phone at night so I haven't run the battery down to 0% yet.\nOled screen. Hard to say here. I've always liked Lcd screens and this is my first oled. First thing i noticed is i dont have nearly the eye fatigue i did with lcd. I can be on my phone, look up at the tv and my eyes dont really have to adjust like they did before. After a few weeks I'm really enjoying the dark blacks on the oled too. Also at lower screen brightness it doesn't look as washed out. So far I'd call it a win although I'm still concerned about possible burn in.\nI bought the V30+ because I'm on Sprint so i got the included earbuds. They sound good but they dont really take full advantage of the HiFi DAC. When i plug in my Bose headphones the music really comes alive. Much better sound and its much louder while still sounding good.\nNext big thing is the camera. For me the camera is good/not great as a point and shoot. If you're into tinkering the camera is amazing. There's so much you can do with so many setting combinations. Thats IF... The wide angle camera takes the cake for me though. I use the wide angle almost as much as the normal shooter. If I'm calling a duck a duck though, I was most impressed with the Pixel 2xl for great point and shoot pics.\nI held out on buying because of the first wave issues. I do have a slight blue tint, much less than i saw on the display units and it really doesn't bother me. \nBefore buying I narrowed the field down to the V30, Pixel xl 2 and the Note 8. I think each phone has their advantages but the V30 won me over.\nAs a side note i did go with a minimal case which adds a lot of grip but little drop protection.

I was a long-time Samsung user, but the edge screen and poor fingerprint scanner placement had me looking elsewhere.\nMy only reservation on the V30 really was the poor quality experience that I had with the LG G4 (had issues with three of them, many others I knew had issues too). Once reports of the poor display came to light on the V30, I was even more hesitant. After browsing three forums over the past few weeks (3 or 4 times a day checking here, reddit, and XDA) I decided that I could take the chance and grab the V30, despite my carrier's poor return policies. \nThe phone had a large update (approx 775mb) out of the box from my carrier, Bell Mobility. Oct. 1 is the security patch date. Phone is version 1, manuf in Oct.\nHere are my initial impressions with the device after the first 24 hours, compared to my trusty old Galaxy S7 where applicable:\n1. The glitches\n- automatic brightness did not work out of the box. Noticed it after a carrier update. Clearing the cache and doing a factory reset (which I always do, especially after a major update) seemed to fix it. Works great now.\n- there is a small horizontal band if I lower the brightness to 10% on a clear white background, and I stare really closely. See my next comment.\n- the fingerprint scanner had an issue with the scar on my index finger. I have a scar from my childhood that makes the skin in one spot a bit flatter than the rest of my fingerprint. When setting up the fingerprint scanner initially, the V30 complained that I needed to clean the scanner. That said, once I set it up, I have not had issues unlocking my device with that finger. My multiple Samsung devices never had an issue with that same scarred finger.\n- double knock to wake the phone works great, but not to put it to sleep using the Nova Prime launcher that I use. I had Nova Prime working properly on my old LG G4, but I can't seem to get it working properly on the V30. I did find other threads on here that deal with this, and I did not see anything that made the knock to sleep work in a way I liked.\n2. The display\n- the store where I bought my V30 had returns for poor display on their \"first batch\" but none since. The initial display complaints I believe are real and founded on the most part. \nHowever, my display seems fine, and I consider myself picky. I have used it in low light and auto brightness put my phone at 15% when I was reading reddit and Twitter last night. I could not see a flaw at all. None. Colours were great, sharpness is great, scrolling is great. Everything is honestly great.\nI took the V30 and compared it side by side to my Samsung S7 flat. I stared at the same apps and wallpaper of both phones side by side, and I'll say that my 1 year old S7 has a slightly better screen for whites. Also, there is a very slight blue tint when tilting at extreme angles on the V30 that is not present on the S7. I would never ever have noticed these things had I not read about them on forums multiple times first, and if I had not been staring at both screens at once for a period of time.\nMy verdict on the screen: I would never had noticed anything if I had not worked really hard to find issues, and I cannot notice anything during regular use, despite my trying. But I will say that my old Galaxy S7's display quality is s very slight step ahead of the V30.\nBattery: just one day in, and I have not taken stats or screenshots. That said, after one full day (driving with Waze for about an hour, playing with the phone off and on all day, etc) I made it home after moderate to heavy use at 60%, where my Galaxy S7 would easily had been left at around 30% at similar or slightly less use. I can tell already that early reports of stellar battery life is true. I was always happy with my S7, but this phone did really well for day one with all my apps installed, and being abused by Waze.\nI also use dark themes where possible. I'm using the high contrast theme that came with the V30, as it has the deep blacks that look good and work well with OLED's battery use. I use auto brightness and let the phone handle it.\nPerformance: I don't do anything crazy with the phone. No glitches and the performance is smooth. My Galaxy S7 worked great too. Using Nova Launcher on both. I don't game.\nCamera: I'm a little disappointed with the camera. I will say that I can be happy with it, but I will say that in pure auto mode, the S7 does a slight bit better in low-light indoors. Outside is fine, and wide screen is great. I just used auto so far, no video, and only played around a bit.\nSpeakers: the speaker on the S7 was a bit louder than the V30. I don't use headphones or buds often, and in Canada, our device does not come with headphones (no 2 year warranty, fancy gift cards or VR headsets, etc.) Carriers here suck.\nAccessories:\nScreen protector - finding screen protectors that I will like is going to be a challenge. I tried the Moko glass protector I got on Amazon and it was horrible. I have never ever found a glass protector for the curved glass screens found on the S7 and V30 that I liked. I hate the halo effect, and I hate the dot matrix on many. My preference is to use PET hard plastic protectors for these phones with curved glass edges, and I'm having a hard time finding one. Spigen makes an incredible one for the S7, they are not making it for the V30. I have some coming off of eBay. I'll follow up in an appropriate screen protector thread, but be warned about screen protection.\nCase - using the Spigen Neo Hybrid gunmetal on my grey V30. Looks great, feels great. Recommended highly.\nCables - I have a bunch of new USB 3.0 to USB c cables (with the resistor) from Anker and Aukey. This is my first phone with a power connector that is reversible which I love. I'll have to be careful that my wife does not try to use the wrong cables in the wrong port.\nThis is it. Loving having a large screen again.

I also hate the curved screen.\nMy wants/needs for its replacement:Wireless charging was a must for me - it's just too convenient to plop it in the cradle at night (and the time varies, so scheduling doesn't work for me), and let Trigger engage DND mode, kill the AOD, and shut off bluetooth.I didn't want a device quite this large overall, but I drew a line in the sand of 6\" x 3\".IP67/68 was also a requirement.screen size of 5.3-5.8\" would be ideal.\nThe decision boiled down to basically 2 devices - The V30 and the iphoneX, oddly enough.

I was hoping for a little better long-range performance like the X and N8 have, as zooming is often what I do with the camera, but still pleased.\nThe fingerprint reader is \"holy crap\" fast, and even facial recognition works well as long as there's a fair amount of light around.\nAndroid Auto flies with this thing (like it should), and I've had no issues in the limited use it's gotten so far with my Sony XAV-AX100 head unit.\nIt's funny - People all over the interwebs gush about this device or that device and then lament the absence of a headphone jack, the placement of the fingerprint reader, bezels, screen only being 1080p, no IP67/68, or the overall size, and never even think of this hidden gem.\nIt might be the honeymoon period (I got this thing 4 days ago), but I'm almost second-guessing my change to the next \"every year\" plan, because I can't imagine a 2018 device that will make me want to change away from the V30.

We know the general grouping of those at the front of the pack; which is what I listed including the words \"in no particular order\", which was a phrase used intentionally because very few of us could agree on the exact order of 8 to 10 phones, but we can agree those are generally the ones reviewers put at the front of the pack. \nFrom there, we can also safely assert that that, given the known relative quality of the G5, G6 and V20, and based on the assumption that the V30 is better than its predecessors, that the V30 is in the top 30 - because the other LG phones land distributed throughout the middle of the pack of that top 30 ranking. Heck, the G4 might even barely make the top 30, though my guess is probably not. \nSo the entirety of my statement about positioning indicates that I think that the highest we could rank the V30 would be 9th place and the lowest would be 30th place.

The $99 version is more than enough for the average user.

You could set up the 2.4 GHz network for the older legacy equipment under say Wireless-G or even N & then have the newer equipement use the 5 GHz network under Wireless-AC. The idea is to avoid oversaturation of devices under 2.4 GHz & move devices that need more bandwidth to the 5 GHz network. The 2.4 GHz is usually cluttered/congested with devices such as cordless phones, microwaves, baby monitors and a bunch of other wireless devices that would interfere with the 2.4 GHz WiFi networks.\nThe other key feature (only on the top model) is the Killer Prioritization Engine which would automatically identifiy gaming data packets and prioritizes them over other devices to give games low latencies or reduce the lag. It mostly benefits devices with Killer Networking components so your typical consoles wouldn't benefit much from this feature. \nThe $99 Linksys AC3200 TriBand Smart WiFi Router would be a great choice, but the midrange $199 (Linksys WRT3200ACM Mu-MIMO Gigabit WiFi Router) is a much better choice/value since it includes the Dual Band & also the MU-MIMO technology which decreases the time each device has to wait for a signal and dramatically speeds up your network.", "time": "11-19-2017 01:47 PM", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post6075712", "text": "There are sites at which you can test the voice quality of an internet connection (they';re meant for VoIP, but they'll give you a good idea of how Wifi calling will work.

It works if I play the music manually.\nBut, if I press a button on my Bluetooth headset or speaker and ask it to play a song, an artist, or an album, Google Assistant insists that I set a default music service. It will not use a music app to play local music.\nI would like it to use a third-party app called CloudPlayer, by doubleTwist, to play local music. For a while, pressing the Bluetooth button would at least trigger a dialog box allowing me to select the stock Music player or CloudPlayer. Now, however, that doesn't happen.\nOddly, if I instead tap the Google button from the home screen and then tap the microphone and tell it to play an artist, an album, or a song, it usually does play the song from CloudPlayer locally.

Several apps that promise to do that simply don't work.

I think Samsung phones let the user do this, but I couldn't find anything on the web about LG phones. One workaround can be helpful for people who text you often. Open the messaging thread for a given contact, tap Menu>People & Options, and look for a notification option there. See if you can change the notification tone -- if you can, it will change for that messaging thread only. You can do this for all of your other existing messaging threads.

What I will say is that LG didn't take full advantage of their f/1.6 aperture by decreasing the sensor size which makes for less bright but less noisy, low light shots.(from what I've seen) But the V30 is more like a DSLR than most phones in that it takes excellent photos in great conditions. In low light and some tricky situations, you have to go into manual mode for the best results. No professional uses a DSLR at night in auto mode. You just don't get the best results that way. The \"problem\" with the V30 is the same one as most LG phones: they simply aren't the best in auto mode. Unfortunately that kind of leaves a mark on LG phones when in fact the cameras are very capable. And given their extensive manual mode you really can get amazing low light shots although you may need a tripod in a certain situations. \nWhat I'm seeing with the Pixel that is so darn intriguing is that even in low light and especially in high dynamic range shots, the camera just does it all with the push of a button. Google's algorithms have been so fine tuned that it takes away the need for a dedicated manual mode. And in low light situations(something that LG desperately needs to adopt) the highlights from light sources are preserved beautifully. You just can't get that with the V30 and definitely not without some extra equipment like an ND filter. And with the V30 you have to make a choice in high dynamic range scenes: rely on auto mode HDR which will still probably over expose the highlights to a degree or shoot in manual at a faster shutter speed and then bring the shadows up in post. Rivaling smartphones just handle the situations more intelligently and that's more on LG's software side than the hardware. \nBut it depends on who writes the review from The Verge before I can really trust that its a genuine experience.

If you are wiling to invest a bit of time to learn the intricacies of LG camera software, I think overall you will not be disappointed with it.

The V30's 16MP sensor is is 5.87mm diagonally with a 1.0\u03bcm pixel size. To put that in perspective, the first generation Pixel's 12MP sensor is 7.87mm with 1.55 \u03bcm pixels. The new Pixel uses a different sensor, a 12MP that runs 6.84mm (1.4\u03bcm)Yes, they have a wide aperture and top quality glass lenses, but they NEED a wide aperture and top quality lenses to compensate for those wee pixels.\nAll things being equal, smaller pixels are more prone to noise than larger ones... and that increased noise sensitivity becomes even more an issue as ISO values go up.... which then requires more noise reduction processing... etc. And whether this is intentional or not, LG tends to go way overboard with NR and they end up stomping on real data in the picture.\nI have a couple of samples kicking around here somewhere where I took some shots of a calendar that I had hanging on the wall of my office. With the 6P I have (sensor was same size as the Pixel 1), if you looked at the calendar you could see the slight variations and grain of the paper it is printed on.

But contrary to what's been hammered into our brains... noise isn't necessarily bad and sometimes it adds a bit of character to a picture. So while my XL might have more noise, it also retains a significant amount more detail along with that noise. To be honest, the 6P/Pixel's shots have a film-like quality to them.... They might be softer and have more noise, but they look REAL.... like an actual photograph. The stuff I get out of my G6 has been processed so heavily that it ceases to look like a photograph and instead looks like a digital reconstruction. (Yes, I know Google has HDR+ which is, by a WIDE margin the best image processing in all of mobiledom, but it is what it is)\nOK...

All did well, but suffered from the exact same processing problems. It's what LG wants in their cameras and I don't see any indication that they've made any kind of fundamental shift.\nI will say this... if you've used a 6P or Pixel (or even a 5X), you probably have become very used to how the pictures look. And Google and LG sit at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of image processing. When looking at pics taken from the G6 scrunched down on a phone screen, or posted to social media, they look really good... there, the heavy processing gives the appearance that the picture is better focused, cleaner. Go look around at reviews and you will see people comment that Pixel shots look soft.. and they do, because they haven't been sharpened with an angle grinder. But if you look at them at full resolution, those sharp, focused pictures take on a weird artificial pall.\nNow, my wife takes a bazillion pics... and she'll go back every couple of months and pics out the best and puts them in albums she has printed by Shutterfly.

The Pixel has absolutely no problem doing so every time. I really love everything else about the V30 though - the thinner lighter body, the wireless charging, the way it feels in the hand, the themes, etc. I've still got about 10 days before my return window expires and I'll keep experimenting, but I've been sadly disappointed by the camera.

I had a real love/hate relationship with the G6, with the latter becoming more as time went on (anyone who frequented the G6 board probably knows my saga already).\nNow, the V30 is an incredible phone. The one I had won the lottery and the display is actually really good. Even the blue shift is minimal, at steep angles and only with white screens. Really a total non issue. Performance is great, lightyears better than the G6... that thing would cough and spit up after running for a few days and sometimes launching the camera became more of a suggestion than command. UI performance is really smooth. I mean, LG has never been associated with fluid UIs. V30 fits that bill. It feels GREAT in hand and its surprisingly light.\nAnd the camera. Now, the G6's camera is my biggest gripe with that thing. Everything was way too oversharpened and the halos just made things look weird. And noise was reduced so heavily that any sort of texture, from walls to faces, all completely washed clean of any depth and realism.\nV30 has NONE of that. Well, almost none. It launches with immediacy and takes pictures the instant I tap that shutter button. Well, other than the somewhat annoying 'slide to zoom' function that had me dropping to the wide angle way too easily but it is quick. Outside it does wonderful; great detail, nice colors and the processing cudgel that the G6 slammed on every pic was nowhere to be seen. Even little bare branches way off in the distance look like little bare branches way off in the distance and not glowing wires.\nNow, my biggest concern was in lower light shots since LG, for some reason, has stubbornly stuck with small sensors. Wide aperture or not, small sensor is small. But I found that it still did a great job. I took a shot under my desk at work and I could read the printing on the side of the power cable plugged into an outlet, V30's flexing its 16MP muscles there... my XL took a well appointed shot in the same situation but the high res detail of V30 just did a little bit better.\nNow, here's the part where I get to the 'but...' I was sure I had what very well might be as close to perfect a phone as I could have hoped. That is, until I started taking pics of my kids in the evening and the V30 fell completely flat on its face. The well preserved skin tones and features that I saw out in the sun were now strangled within an inch of their lives. It's clear to me that LG does some sort of face detection and then applies what I can only describe as a what you would get if you gave a 2 year old a Wacom tablet and let them go at it in Photoshop.\nRemember that story a while back where the person tried to 'fix' a fresco in Italy and ended up completely destroying the portrait of Jesus? Yeah, that's pretty much what happens if you try to take a picture of a person inside or at night. \nAnd the crazy thing is that LG does this on purpose. If I took the same pic without the aforementioned child in the frame, details were crisp, noise reduction kept to a nice level, you name it. But if it sees a face in there somewhere.... *splat*\nAnd since my wife takes way WAY to many pics of my kids in situations like this. It might as well be sparks shooting out of the charging port every time you unlock it. If I were to hand her this thing, well, next time you'd see ol' LeoRex, it would be on the side of a milk carton.\nNeedless to say the V30 will be going back before the return period expires... which is sad since it was SO....

The V30 is a exceptionally good one, top to bottom. It's the best running LG branded phone I've ever used by far (I've had many) , it has a bunch of slick features and deserves all the praise it's been getting.\nBut it ain't perfect. None are.\nWe're getting to the point where these things are getting so good that the only way to evaluate them is to hammer on their flaws. And the V30's only flaw that I've run into as of yet is inside that camera. It's extremely fussy. We're at the point where you shouldn't have to say 'oh, just go into manual mode and....'. No... That's no going to fly. You can't say it'll perform with the best of them if you gotta go in and screw around with exposures and ISOs and hope it focused on what you directed it to. If I wanted to do that all the time, I'll carry around a Nikon. Plus I can download one of a few excellent camera apps that give access to all the same manual controls (and some LG didn't include) in another phone.\nThe vast majority of users will never touch that mode as they lean on auto modes to take the vast majority of their pictures. OEMs have to nail that. Otherwise they are just saving their own time, money and effort and making the end user finish the job.\nI've had a chance to take some shots with the modified Google camera and you it does, indeed, do a better job on a simple point and shoot... So a hacked camera designed for a completely different phone does a better job than the native one. I shouldn't have to go in and click click here and click click there to avoid getting a shot that looks like Salvador Dali painted while in a bad mood. It should do that from the get go.\nAnd they could have done it sooooo easy, that's the crazy part. I can pop the camera into manual mode, flip on the manual mode's noise reduction and take a better picture than auto. Why? Why not just use THAT programming?! Otherwise what happens is you end up with a lot of customers disappointed in the pictures because they, like my wife for example, aren't interested in fussing around with an app to get something good... Then they just turn to the phone next to it... The one that they can just pick up and snap something that's just as good as the one you took fiddling with some toggles.\nI wouldn't be poking around in every nook and cranny of this phone if I thought it was junk. On the contrary, I'm trying to find a reason to keep it.

It's easier & convenient to point & shoot. Yes, some phones do it better than others, but it's all very subjective & all depends on the user's preferences.

The majority of customers will ask techy folks like ourselves, their friends, and more importantly, store staff.

I thought about some other conversations I have had on this board when I was at the mall this past weekend, and I was in my carrier store and I asked if the G6 was popular and how it was doing for sales and warranty claims, and the salesperson mentioned past LG bootloop issues before I even had a chance to ask specifically about it. They indicated that the G6 was not selling very well for them or their carrier (Bell Mobility). They were discounted quickly by Bell. I did not ask specifically if this salesperson hesitated recommending this phone because of bootloop issues in the past.\nThe past bootloop issues are def on the minds on the salespersons for sure, but no way to measure how much this actually affects sales.

It's also very light weight compared to the V20, slightly narrower and shorter (not super narrow like the S8 Plus). I'm very glad the curves were done right, not too curvy nor affecting usage. The back looks kinda weird though, glass looks a little warped.\nCamera: I honestly didn't see any immediate difference with the camera quality and speed (compared to the V20) with the exception of the 13MP camera which looks awesome, the wide angle distortion is gone and quality is very good. I haven't gotten to really test it out as I was in the store playing with it for a minute, I think it does focus a little faster and has a better bokeh effect when taking pictures of objects close up.\nDisplay: I also didn't see much difference with the V20's display and the V30's AMOLED screen, looks very similar. I'm sure it would look better in dim light since it's AMOLED. I think the P-AMOLED helped make the phone lighter since it's plastic and not glass.\nIf you already have the V20/G6, then maybe it's better to hold off till a price drop or wait for the G7/V40.

Size and weight for a screen this size is just unreal.\nCamera: Between work and bad weather, haven't taken but 1 pic so far. As for quality, I was extremely pleased with the V20 camera, from what I have seen the G6 improved on that somewhat, and I expect the same incremental improvements with the V30. Face it, unless you are coming from a low-end phone, all the flagships have cameras on par now, with their own unique strengths in certain areas. If you are waiting for one that is going to blow all others out of the water, get comfortable...\nDisplay: Blows the V20 away. I was able to tweak the color on the V20 to where it didn't bother me \"too much\", but I'm biased towards LED. Comparing the same pics on my V20 - V30, color, clarity, and of course depth of black is miles ahead. No banding or hot spots either, but maybe I'm just lucky there.\nAgree on price drop if that's your priority, but I like having the latest and greatest. As for comparison to the V20, other than my preference for LED over LCD, the biggest difference is in size and form factor. Using and carrying the V20 feels like a brick now in comparison, and this is from a guy who isn't afraid of big phones (had a Nexus 6 before the V20). The features and screen size they have put into a package this small and light just amazes me. Was also worried I would miss the second screen, but I actually prefer the Always On now for when off.

This should only get better with Android O.\nThe camera....this is tough for me, because I don't use the wide angle at all. The regular I would say is better, but how much, I'm not sure. Took some pics at an NHL game a few days ago, and no blur during action shots. They aren't Sports Illustrated quality shots but are useable.\nThe music part is a nice improvement. The quad dac is amazing and the audio/video recording capabilities are really good. Took some video and audio only at a rather loud Third Eye Blind concert and was quite pleased.\nThe overall speed is definitely faster running the web or programs on the V30.\nSo that's my take right now.

I really loved my G2 years back - a wonderful but overlooked phone.\nI like the idea of a wide angle lens in addition to the field of view. I used to be deep into photography in the days of film, and one really awesome and effective practice of pro photographers was the use of wider lenses. I recall looking through a Nat Geo magazine and noting that just about every shot was with a 28mm lens or less. So I ran out and bought a Nikkor 28mm and 24mm. The 24mm was my fave and it was the lens that got the most OMG's from friends looking at my pics. So, I think LG's choice of a wide angle lens is wonderful.\nI have been using SnapSeed since it dropped - plus other photo apps - and while I have no interest arguing what the best cellphone camera is, it's commonly held that the Pixel does a great job. Everyone in my family owns a new S8 and we compare pics all the time. There's some chance that with enough time in PhotoShop, I could get their S8 pics to look the same as what comes from my Pixel XL, but the point is, I don't have to. \nFor me, the Achilles heel for the Pixel XL is the horrible bluetooth connection - it stutters with all of my BT devices. This is the #1 reason for me, and countless other Pixel owners, to dump the Pixel with this new crop of phones coming up. I feel confident that LG will get BT right, plus there are so many other unique features of the V30.\nAs of now, I think the V30 is the top pick of the crop - on paper.

I've always been a Samsung person, at least since the S2 up to the S8 and including a Note 5. But, I have to tell you that I HATE Bixby, I hate the button taking up space. Yes, I know I can turn it off but the button placement and Bixby still sending out an occasional notice has turned me off to Samsung.\nSo, I decided to try out the V30 even though the last LG phone I had was a candy bar plain phone back somewhere in the mid 90's. For the first couple of days I was Ok with the V30 but hadn't committed to keeping it but yesterday I did some checking and found that it has one thing going for it that really surprised me. We live in a highly marginal area and phone reception has been hit or miss so we rely on wifi calling. In doing tests on my Samsung I knew that my reception ran about -120dbm and calling or receiving calls was totally hit or miss without the wifi calling. I had wifi calling turned on from the beginning with the V30 so didn't bother to check out signal strength until yesterday. What I found really blew me away. The V30 signal strength for the last day is consistently running between -113 and -115 dbm. Not killer strength but enough for consistent quality sounding calls. Doing download tests I found the the V30 is pulling down about 15megs down and 1.5 to 2.0 up. In testing the S8 I get about 3 to 5 megs down and about .4 to .8 megs up.\nThis V30 is really outshining the S8 in side by side radio tests, running in the same location with about an inch distance between them and using the same network and the same sim (switching back and forth). That is not the carrier, it is not the sim, that is radio quality and ability to draw in signal via the antennae.\nThe V30 has its strengths and weaknesses but the radio quality is critical to me and it will be staying here and the S8 will be going bye-bye. I may have to consider getting another one for my wife as she is using a Sammy S7 and I may have to consider moving her into her own V30.", "time": "10-09-2017 05:12 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6012726", "text": "great to know! so side by side you would say 5-7 dbm better ? both using the same bands?", "time": "10-09-2017 05:21 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6012766", "text": "Yes 5 to 7 dBm better consistently.

Yes, it was my Complete My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Collection! No, I'm kidding. It was an LG V30. My Little Pony comes in two days (I hope you guys know I'm joking).\nBefore I begin, I want to preface by telling all of you that the LG V30 is one fantastic phone. At least, after about six hours it is, haha. Now for all the bad stuff.\nThe LG V30, as beautiful as it is, is a fingerprint magnet of epic proportions. I've always known the downsides of glass phones, but I'm definitely purchasing a dbrand skin the first chance I get (as soon as dbrand, ya know, lets me do that). Next, the software. Yes, it's fast. Yes, you can customize it to your exact specifications. Yes, it still looks great. But the point is, I shouldn't have to spend two hours just to make everything look the way I want it to. Also, bloatware. This is actually just a negative against Android in general. My app list is twice as long as the app list for my Windows phone... and I haven't installed nearly as many apps on my Android. I'd be okay with the choice if I actually had a choice in the matter, but most of the preinstalled apps can't be uninstalled. But this is all stuff you guys already know. So on to the great stuff!\nLG is well known for releasing fantastic phones filled with all the features we're all thinking we want but never have. Then they completely pass underneath the radar, along with the rest of the competition. It's not that LG makes bad smartphones, it's that they have no earthly clue how to market their devices or actually get them into people's hands. And the LG V30 is another one of those phones, except times a few thousand. Here is a beautiful, perfectly crafted device filled with (almost) all the best hardware specs you can buy, and yet its release has been plagued with vague promises, terrible availability, and just sheer confusion. Honestly, it's disappointing. LG certainly has a place in the smartphone world, but a lot of people aren't even actively aware that LG makes smartphones. The LG V30 is the best smartphone LG has ever made, but it likely won't change anything for them. Let's move onto why.\nLG's design has evolved dramatically over the years, from the iconic G3, to the marginally different G4, to the beautiful beast that was the V10, to the funky failing G5, to the all metal V20...you get the point. The V30 is the culmination of everything that LG has learned over the years, a perfectly symmetrical glass sandwich with lovely curves and impressive dimensions. And it feels amazing. It's so light, and sits in your hand juuuuust right. But it feels fragile. Not as fragile as any recent Samsung, but almost fragile enough to convince me to purchase a case (I'm not going to). Basically, expect a phone with exquisite quality and detail, but a glass back that will collect EVERY fingerprint you have to offer. But it's all worth it, because the display on the front is incredible. This is easily the best display LG has every put into a smartphone, and it rivals Samsung's best. It's not AS good, but it's good enough. It's bright, colorful, and just all around beautiful. I haven't had any real backlighting issues like people have been reporting, but it is my first day with this phone, after all. I'll update if I notice any issues, but so far this is a display worthy of this phone. Battery life has been surprisingly great so far. I haven't spent nearly enough time to give you any definitive conclusions, but the V30 has lasted for hours with all barrels firing at full blast, and never broke thirty percent.\nNow I would tell you about the camera, but I haven't played with it yet. I've only had this guy for a few hours, give me a break. I'll update you guys as time goes on.

I love my Samsung phones, but the s6 edge didn't have the battery life,whereas the s7 edge has it all except for great media. The v10 was great for media, but had poor battery life, poor screen, and was just way to bulky to carry around. But now, the v30 seems to correct all the shortcomings. The 32bit ess Sabre dac is just mind blowing, the new poled screen just ad bright, and vivid as my Samsung S7 edge, it's a 6\" screen but no bigger in the hand than the s7 edge, incredibly light and very easy to control.

I'm def what you would consider a power user and I'm getting great life with the V30. Plus with fast charging, throwing it on a charger for 20 min gives you a surprising amount of charge. This should only get better with Android O.\nThe camera....this is tough for me, because I don't use the wide angle at all. The regular I would say is better, but how much, I'm not sure. Took some pics at an NHL game a few days ago, and no blur during action shots. They aren't Sports Illustrated quality shots but are useable.\nThe music part is a nice improvement. The quad dac is amazing and the audio/video recording capabilities are really good. Took some video and audio only at a rather loud Third Eye Blind concert and was quite pleased.\nThe overall speed is definitely faster running the web or programs on the V30.\nSo that's my take right now. I wouldn't consider this a \"must have\" upgrade if one is loving the V20, but it's good. Had I been a more patient user who doesn't always need the latest and greatest, going from the V20 to the V40 probably would've been a lot more noticeable and made more sense, but with the $200 visa card and free Google VR stuff, to me was worth it... but I'll say just barely. The actual feature I saw that I really wanted was in a review video, the audio playing from YouTube was not only coming from the bottom firing speaker but also the earpiece speaker. Alas, was not included and no one seems to know why.\nFinal verdict...I'm ok with the upgrade enough that I won't go back to the V20, but it just barely made the cut for me.

I suspect that has niche appeal in general, for me it's a nice to have but for almost the same price I'd rather the Note 8's better screen, camera and memory particularly when I have a decent high quality audio player already. The F1.6 may sound impressive but it's really just for marketing, it's only a fractionally larger aperture than rivals and it loses that advantage due to the choice of smaller sensors so I would expect other cameras to outperform it in low light and in general.\nWhere I think LG could have really stood out was price, that's the big downside of all the main bezel-less phones so if LG had undercut them I think they could have made their mark that way. Making it more expensive than the S8 series and almost the same price as the Note 8 is just way too much for the spec it has. I will be surprised if it doesn't go exactly the same way as the G6 which was also a nice handset but couldn't quite match the S8 and similar but LG still priced it the same as the S8 which unsurprisingly did not work well. \nLG's lack of marketing and branding is certainly an issue but at least here, even those that are fully aware of the V30 are choosing rival devices.

And power cycling would make the test irrelevant when you want the test to show how fast the phone could be in real life conditions. In real life several apps would have tried to run in the background already and the phone would have several apps cached, not empty. What you're looking for is a drag race where we strip everything down to minimum and race with just the engines. That race is useless. We need to race with everything on board.

Which is also a reason why I find doing a speed test right after booting or RAM clearing is a stupid idea. It's not gonna perform like that 3hrs later. You're looking at highest possible speed there, not speed on regular usage.\nWe're not starting from a zero line here. We're starting from whatever LG and Samsung decided to do. If Samsung's software tells the phone to keep 2GB free and LG's software tells the phone to eat all the RAM it wants, then clearing the RAM creates a false result.

That's precisely the point, it guarantees a cold start of the Apps without any residue in the system. When the CPU starts executing instructions, the main memory (RAM) simply stores those computations. The Android OS does not support swapping, which would mean that when your memory starts running out or pushing for its upper limit, the CPU starts asking other processes to release their resources (garbage collection). The less memory you have the the longer you have to wait to start a new process, which would create a delayed response. The summation of these delayed responses is what you're seeing in the first video. It's basic CPU architecture, hence the need for a power cycle. Looking at the facts right now (without any assumptions from years ago), he clearly did not show or do a power cycle otherwise the results would have been similar to the second video. It also really doesn't take long to do one either, adding an extra minute or two to the video won't make a difference. \nJust so you know, contrary to popular belief (without taking into consideration the software overlays TouchWiz vs LG UX 6.0) main memory doesn't really effect the launch speed of apps. Just like a computer, the launch speed of applications are actually dependent on the speed of the CPU & it's corresponding secondary storage, which would be the cache/flash memory. Once an application is in memory it's already running so the dependency would be on how long it takes the process to go from secondary memory to main memory. Keep in mind the CPU on the V30 is clocked higher which would be the slight advantage shown in the second video. \nHaving more RAM (Note 8) simply means better task-switching & the added advantage of running more complicated apps or even opening larger/more complex files. A faster CPU (V30) means having a faster turnaround between input and response (less lag). CPU-bound apps would also benefit with better background processing. In short, both are equally important; your own personal usage pattern will determine which is more valuable for you. If you generally stick with in a single program and you're sensitive to input-output latency then having faster CPU will be more valuable for you. If you constantly task switch between many different apps or if you need to run complex memory-hungry apps to open complex large files, then having extra RAM is going to be more valuable to you.", "time": "10-11-2017 01:11 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6014757", "text": "And you point out exactly why a restart is not needed or even wanted for a speed test that seeks to emulate real life condition. In real life you will not be using the phone fresh from a restart always. You will be using it after it has been sitting around executing background processes for some time already. So a speed test of two phones that did not go a reboot is a more valid representation of real world speed as compared to a speed test done on a freshly power cycles device. We are not looking for the max speed the phones are capable of. We are looking for the usual speed we can expect after they have been sitting around executing whatever process they want to execute on their own. I don't see why it's so hard for you to see that point. You keep on asking for a cold restart which will show max possible speed when I keep repeating that's not the type speed results we're looking for. We're looking for the speed under normal usage circumstances, and that means phones that haven't been rebooted. And that's the case for non rebooted apps. But you insist that Phonebuff probably cheated and did not power cycle. \nAnd second, the second video does not invalidate the first video. The second video gave more points to the LG on a per app basis, while the 1st video gave the score to Samsung on an accumulated time basis. Two very different scoring systems. For example, in the first video by Phonebuff it would not matter if the LG opened 10 apps faster than the Samsung by one tenth of a second if it was 2 seconds behind in one app, giving Samsung the win. That would be a 10-1 score against the Samsung in the scoring system used in the second video. See the difference? Even in the second video during the task switching part the Samsung was faster than the LG, best seen probably on Asphalt 8. Also in apps where LG won in opening, it was pretty close. But in say the Youtube app, LG was half a second or more slower. There were also some instances where to my eyes either the LG or Samsung was faster, but the reviewer called it for the other device. Second, side tests that are performed with one hand for either phone are iffy because both hands will not be always moving at the same time no matter what you think. There is always a fraction of a second difference between them mainly because of how our brain is wired. The dominant hand will always be faster than the other. And you cannot focus on two things at the same time, hence as I said the inconsistency on points given as I said. The phonebuff style test were each phone goes through the app obstacle course and is timed independently of the other device is more valid than side by side test by simple virtue of human anatomy. \nSo your arguments that the 2 videos show different results do not hold as well. It's mainly 2 different ways of scoring with one of them even more prone to error.\nLet's put it this way. After your phone has been sitting on your desk all night while you sleep, and you wake up wanting to play a game, say SIM City, do you reboot or just open the game? You just open the game.

I only have a problem with ones that are not done properly like your favorite video. Like I said before, you need to level the starting point. You can do this by making sure both phones are running with same amount of used memory or do a power cycle to clear the RAM. Neither of those were done in the first video, hence it can't be trusted. If the test is started with different amounts of used main memory/RAM available, the test would be skewed. Using a similar CPU, a device with say 10% used memory will always be faster than one with 90% used memory. Yes the tester could have cheated & easily had stuff running in background for the V30 & using up almost all it's RAM which would to lead to the garbage collection & the delayed reponse I mentioned before.", "time": "10-12-2017 12:00 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6016108", "text": "The starting point cannot be level if the system itself is the one that loaded up all the excess stuff in the first place.\nFor example, let's say both phones were sitting for 8 hours after bootup, but the LG system loaded up 90% of RAM, but the Samsung system only loaded up 60% of RAM. The LG would of course be slower in that scenario, but the test would be valid because they are coming from the same starting point of being booted up several hours before. Making a bootup would not give them both the same starting point. It would hide the flaws in the LG memory management (example only), which would make the test invalid. So basically I'm saying the entire idea of doing a power cycle before a speed test is a wrong representation of actual world speed, if that is your argument. It doesn't matter if one device has more RAM used up than the other. It's the device's own fault for loading all of that. This is similar to how the Snapdragon S7 lost to the G5 last year in the Phonebuff video. The S7 loaded up more stuff onto memory and had troubles swapping. In that scenario it was the fault of the Samsung OS. And in this case, it's the fault of the LG OS. The test starting would different amounts of RAM available does not skew the test unless it was deliberately done (like deliberately loading apps onto the LG RAM before the test). However if it was the system itself that called those things to RAM on its own, it shot itself in the foot and it's no concern since it is simply reflective of how the phone OS was written to perform. \nYour analogy of starting 2 meters ahead in a race is wrong.

The same holds true if you let the phones run for 8 hours after a boot up. You would just need to make sure that any external objects introduced to the memory space such as games & etc are fully closed on both phones (with nothing pending I/O or CPU bound) before you start your test. If any of those variables are not constant, you would lose the ideal of objectivity which would render the test invalid.\nYour analogy is misguided. It's all about managing resources. The objects in memory space can be re-allocated to different reference points at any point in time or even killed to return the used up resources if needed. My lovely analogy was based on CPU latency. \nI admire your persistence, but some of these computer architecture concepts are not simple.

I'm in a difficult spot, as the hot spots on my device aren't that bad. However, I am dealing with some vertical banding (especially on white screens on low brightness). Don't want to play the OLED roulette, so if the banding gets too bothersome, I'll just outright return the phone.\nCamera: Honestly only tested it out a bit in a poorly lit room. Photos were...expected? Nothing horrible, but I wouldn't say any were keepers. I poked around in manual mode, but will have to read up more to figure out how to maximize the usage there. I can report that shutter lag isn't bad at all, even with HDR on auto. However, getting multiple shots in a row isn't easy, as there's definitely a processing delay, as I had to wait a second between quick pressing the button. Will have more on this tomorrow, as I give the camera more of a run.\nQuad-Dac: This thing is amazing! Music sounds excellent through it, and toggling it on and off really shows what is missing in the sound without it. Even lower quality MP3 files sound better. I tested this out on a set of Bose QC 35s and a pair of Monoprice SonicSolace headphones. Both provided a considerable bump in sound quality.\nSize/Feel/Ergonomics: So far, so good. Though, I quickly threw a Spigen Neo Hybrid case on it, as the metal sides are slippery. It's definitely lighter than one would think, but I find it comfortable and sturdy.\nExternal Speaker: It's bad. For a device that boasts the Quad Dac, advanced video recording, and HD sound recording, the on-board speaker was an obvious afterthought for LG. Even comparing it's output to my three year old Droid Turbo, the speaker resonates like every sound coming out of it was recorded in a large, metal tube or underwater. Just not good.\nI have had some small 'bugs' with it. Some buttons that have a pop-up (like disabling apps) will freeze and not bring the pop-up. Going back and forth on the screen clears it and it works fine. And I've had the settings menu force close once, for no reason I could see. I may do a factory reset tomorrow to clear everything if I still see the same issues tomorrow.\nOverall, the V30 performing as expected, though it's still in the discovery phase.

The V20 takes pretty good selfies with adequate lighting, in fact it looks really good. I think it looks better than my older S7 selfie camera. The selfie gesture is also very useful on the LG phones, now add a wide angle front camera and see yourself enjoying that front wide angle camera more often. Very glad they kept it. I suggest everyone who wanted a high definition selfie to flip their phone around and take a picture using the volume button.\nBy the way if you're in a video chat call, the other person can see more with the wide angle instead of just your cropped head.", "time": "10-04-2017 10:22 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Carrier Specific Hardware?

Unfortunately, \"military grade\", in the context of civilian products, is a meaningless term. \nThis is from the other thread, '...\"military grade\", when being used as a term that is not part of the spec requirements for a piece of military equipment, doesn't actually mean anything. It is a marketing term. One thing it might mean is that they are using the same materials as used in a piece of military equipment, but unless they disclose which piece of equipment, there's no way of knowing what exactly it is, if anything. Example, if they were saying the aluminum part of the body was military grade, that could mean it's the same aluminum used in fences, or in forks or in some parts of an Abrams or it could mean it's the same aluminum specs used for the eyelets of hooded t-shirts available in the Exchange. TLDR: \"military\" grade DOES NOT mean ANYTHING, at all, in the context of smartphones'.\nSo here's a good example of how Mil Spec or military grade works: \nMil Spec or military grade 440 steel, used in many products, including some knives, etc. is... 440 steel. It's the exact same product you can pick up at the Home Depot or wherever you choose to buy steel in bulk. If you're not in the military, you call it 440 steel. Is it military grade? Sure. But only because there are products that the military uses that material in. The product is exactly the same.So the \"mil\" part of it, doesn't tell you a thing about it. It doesn't provide any information about the strength, durability or intended uses, in any context. \nMil Spec materials are simply materials that have been adopted to be used in at least one product that is used by or purchased on behalf of the military and the types of materials are thus labeled as to make them interchangeable between production units. So mil spec cotton is... cotton. Mil spec applesauce is applesauce. You get the idea. \nAnother example, if you take your car apart, down to components. Nuts, bolts, sheets of metal and glass, plastic things and some rubber... more than 90% of the materials you have in front of you will likely be, in some degree, mil-spec or 'aircraft grade'. Yet your car is not rated for any theater on earth as a defensive tool. That theater bit is important, because if LG was instead stating that their devices were meeting 'military performance specifications' and specified in which theaters it is so rated, that'd be an interesting conversation. Because that would mean that the device was designed for and tested in conditions similar to anticipated military conditions. In general, we could assume that there is some implied durability or reliability standards being met. Sadly, that's not the case. \nPhones are made out of plastic, silicon, gold, aluminum, glass, etc. Some have ceramic and titanium, some have sapphire, some even have glue. If any of the materials used are also used in any product commissioned for or produced by the military, then that phone maker could label their device as using \"military grade\" products, and it's not a lie. But it's definitely misleading. Because it's implying that it is more durable than, or better performing than other devices... and that's simply not the case. Or at least it's not anything that can be learned from using those materials and/or that term. \nFinally, LG states that their device exceeds minimum standards for the MIL-STD-810G, and for this they are ONLY referring to the drop test, not the rest of the spec, which would protect against intense temperatures, pressure, etc. So here's the test: The device is dropped on each of it's 6 sides, 12 edges and 8 corners from a height of between 2.5 and 4.0 feet (30 to 48 inches) onto a surface that is 2 inches of plywood covering concrete. After each drop it is inspected for damage and at the end of the 26 drops, if it still works then the device passes. So let's ask an obvious question... do you know of a recent device that can't pass that test?  Also, the drops can be divided, at the manufacturer's request, among up to 5 identical units. So it's not 26 drops to 1 device, it's 5 drops each to 4 devices and 6 drops to the remaining 1 device. Also, let's think about what \"works\" means. \"Works\" does not mean \"has no perceivable cracks or blemishes\". \"Works\" means that the touch screen still works, you can make calls, etc. The display can be mostly destroyed and the device can generally pass as still \"works\". TLDR part 2: LG is intentionally using a marketing term, \"military grade\" to imply superiority in build quality or build materials or durability, etc. over their competitors. Doing so is not lying, so long as some of their materials actually are MIL-SPEC materials. Yet, it is definitely not honest, because all of their competitors can do exactly the same thing. This term means literally nothing in the context of smartphones and the implications that LG wants to project are intentionally misleading and we should all agree to stop using this term as if it were a benefit to buying their devices which other devices lack.", "time": "09-03-2017 12:20 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5954432", "text": "It like the term Heavy Duty used for appliance and tools....

It's simply structural engineering at it's finest that yeilds similar results, & LG will not be spilling the beans anytime soon. They have every right to claim \"military grade\" build superiority till the rest of the competition can play catch up. \nThe drop tests you listed (transit drop) are just a fraction of the testing needed for the durability rating, there's so much more. LG posted some of the detailed test results for the G6: http://www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/g6/quality\nJust so you know....this is also no different than Panasonic claiming their toughbooks are \"military grade\" or \"rugged\"...it's simply quality assurance for the consumer.", "time": "09-04-2017 12:46 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5955255", "text": "The point was that the \"military grade\" term is a marketing term with no meaning on civilian products.

They also modified several of the tests without explanation, which is one of the problems with this \"testing\". They create and execute the tests themselves with no oversight. Example, 10 drops at 122 cm instead of the expected 26 drops. \nFinally, none of this should imply that the phone won't be damaged by dropping or by liquid ingress, etc. It implies that the device has a higher chance of still working after that exposure.", "time": "09-04-2017 07:23 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5955558", "text": "The term \"military grade\" simply implies it's something the military would use because it meets their standards (ie 810G).

An IP68 rating simply implies the device has some water & dust resistance. The MIL-STD 810G is much more rigorous & is a regulated by the DOD with a cognizant federal agency overlooking the tests & test subjects. If you look closely at the link I shared with you, there's a little disclaimer on the bottom that states \"Passed 14 different MIL-STD 810G Tests for durability conducted by an independent laboratory in U.S. that conforms to U.S. military standards...\"\nThe last part of your argument is correct. All these durability ratings simply offer some slight resistance & were never meant to offer 100% full resistance.

The first post has a long explanation of \"military grade\" and it's meaning related to civilian products, so I won't go back into all that here. Long story short, is that it is a meaningless marketing term with no standards implied. Even meeting the MIL-STD-810G requirements does not imply \nThe IP68 and MIL-STD-810G tests are not the same, however the IP68 testing that LG does is more rigorous than the aspects of the MIL-STD-810G testing that they went through, so simply stating IP68 rated is enough for those specific tests. That is why I brought up their IP68 test, because for those specific tests, every device that meets or exceeds the standards for IP68 will be able to pass those same tests in the MIL-STD-810G versions. \nThe tests that IP68 does not address are those related to temperature, shock, etc. The MIL-STD-810G tests are not even that heavily regulated by the DOD or anyone else for military products, but they are even less regulated on non-military products. That's the entire problem. In research for this post, I came across dozens of independent sources complaining about the lack of uniformity in the testing process. \nBut much more importantly, the larger point is addressed by a question asked up front in the first post: can you think of a single flagship device in recent memory that would be inoperable after a 4 ft drop onto 2 inches of plywood? I cannot. Almost every device that receives the more stringent IP68 testing is going to be able to pass nearly all of these tests with flying colors. \nTLDR: 1) The IP68 test is a higher standard than the same tests conducted as part of the 810G testing. 2) The remaining tests can be passed by just about every device you can name 3) Nothing about any of these tests makes it a product that is either fit for or commissioned for any sort of military usage. 4) As stated in the first post, the term \"military grade\" is a marketing term, that does not tell us anything about the product.

They are simply phones. \nGiven that the testing requirements for IP ratings are more stringent than the 810G equivalent tests, it is safe to say that most devices with any IP rating can pass the exact same 810G tests (and so can most devices without an IP rating).

Why would they bother telling the consumer that their product failed the parts of 810G? It's also not expensive\nMIL-STD is a ruggedness standard that's touted by electronic manufacturers. The two terms are synonymous. A phone that passes certain parts of the 810G is considered \"rugged.\" Just like how the Samsung S8 Active is considered rugged, the same applies for the LG V series. You do get variations of \"ruggedness\" since other manufactures go above & beyond to exceed the norm. \nAs for Ingress Protection, it's not stringent. It's actually a subset of the 810G. It's literally penetration testing against solid particles & liquids/vapors. The test is not all inclusive. A device can sport two different ratings (ie IP62 & IP67). A device can fail a spray test (up to IP*6) but pass an immersion test (IP*7). Highly concentrated pressure at one point could affect an enclosure differently than distributed pressure you would get with submersion. The manufacturer would simply claim it's IP67 & IP62, anything in between would not be implied.\nLG never claimed or implied that their products were more or less durable than others. The confusion stems from folks misinterpreting the terminilogy. They simply advertised the phone as \"military grade\" just like how Ford puts out commercials about their \"military grade\" F-150 trucks. Just like with any commercial, you typically get a little disclaimer on the bottom of commercial to get more information about the claim.

Fingerprint placement is annoying, battery size is mediocre for a phone that large. Touch Wiz software isn't the best, concerned with longevity of the device. Might as well buy S8+ bc it's cheaper and barely any different. Dual camera is gimmicky, trying to be like Apple, don't need to blur background, I can do it with editing app. S pen isn't really needed. Over hyped like the S8.\nPixel XL 2: no headphone jack, no microSD. Phone is cloud based, need internet access to do everything. Single camera setup. Boring, no innovation or changes. Sure the pure Android is nice but boring like Apple.\nEssential phone: No headphone jack. No features. No microSD. No essentials. No fun. Still uses LCD. Camera hole in center looks ridiculous. Basically a wannabe Xiaomi Mi Max from 2 years ago.\nMoto Z Force 2: looks exactly the same as the 1st one, no changes. Looks boring and ugly, front home button is from 2012. No headphone jack. Design is horrible, giant camera bump, giant chins.\nHTC U11: no headphone jack. Looks way too shiney and glossy, terrible oval shape will slide off table. Still uses LCD. Still has front fingerprint scanner from 2014. Single camera setup. Gimmicky squeeze feature. Nothing exciting. Cheaper to buy previous years U Ultra bc it's basically the same.\nOnePlus 5: software problems already reported (reversed upside-down display). Old, non innovative design. Bezels are too big for 2017. Fast charger not compatible with other fast chargers. Kinda boring, too basic.\nV30: except for the removal of the removable battery and IR blaster, and minimal UI changes, this phone is actually exciting and looks physically better than any of the phones mentioned above. Instead of making excuses, LG man up and improved the audio jack quality with the new DAC. Kept the 16MP camera with the first 1.6 apature sensor, AND included a upgraded 13MP wide angle. Front camera also has wide angle, no one else has that. Improved photography software. Video recording experience improved, upgraded hardware and software. Beautiful flawless design, curves aren't too crazy, FPS is in correct spot. Finally added their AMOLED technology, more durable with P-AMOLED. Added water resistance and wireless charging. Still kept the micro SD slot (no brainier). Software is the most optimized and reliable, and has better longevity than other phones (talking about the V30, not the defects from G4/V10, already fixed that issue starting with G5)\nIf anything, my money is going towards LG because I support innovative designs and features that benefit everyone including myself. Slashing the headphone jack and micro SD is not the answer, nor adding gimmicky features to lure people in. The V30 is a useful phone with useful and high tech features, at a fair price.\nEdit: If you're concerned about the LG bootloop issue, you should also be concerned with Samsung's exploding battery issue which people easily forgave like nothing.

Almost everyone is cropping their photos and losing detail, telephoto reduces the need to do that maintaining higher image quality. \nYou praise LG for having a 1.6/F Aperture, well big deal. It's paired with a smaller camera sensor, with smaller pixels, and is less sensitive to light than the camera in the Note 8. \nI would compare your comments to other brands, but LG and Samsung are the only 2 Android manufacturers I've purchased, and the Note 8 followed by the V30 are the best flagships this year IMO.

But so far, it's not a real thing. 2) because using your phone for work can be done with almost every phone 3) most business users are using their phone to manage email, calendar, calls and sometimes, but not usually, tasks. They're not doing anything magical or out of the ordinary. Your average 20 something person managing a dozen social network accounts, streaming videos left and right, etc. is doing far more with their phone than even the top 10% of business class users. \nI think what you meant to say is that you think that the s-pen and large display makes it attractive for business use. And that's a fair point, but that doesn't mean that the market is actually taking advantage of it in the way that you think they are or ought to, or however you want to parse it. But the truth is, there's probably not a single business process that you think can be accomplished by the Note 8 that can't be accomplished by the Nexus 6, despite the Note 8's 2.87% larger display. \nSo to recap: 1) power users aren't real 2) business users doesn't mean the same thing as power users 3) power users wouldn't be reliant on single features 4) most Note 8 buyers are not business users and 5) given the 1st point, very few if any Note 8 customers are \"power users\". \nThis leads to the conclusion that either a) power users are not a market or b) if they are a market, the Note 8 is not the device for them.", "time": "09-13-2017 03:36 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5972923", "text": "Exactly....", "time": "09-13-2017 04:09 PM", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post5970040", "text": "where the Note 8 loses is in its aspect ratio ....

Of course you have those that really love the new features of the Note 8. But Samsung clearly played it safe especially in the battery department and with the popularity of the S8+ the Note 8 is losing just a little of its unique qualities amd superiority over the slightly littler sibling. And don't get me started on the $$$ they're asking.\nThe dual OIS cameras certainly look very promising but I think this is now LG's stage to shine on now. The unique feature set of the V30 along with a first in class f/1.6 aperture could really move LG closer to the spotlight that Samsung deservedly in most respects enjoys. Even though the V30 will lose a lot of personality(2nd screen) and hardware features(removable battery-IR blaster? maybe), the step up to water resistance and an OLED display narrows the gap between Samsung flagships and LG's.\nI'm really looking for LG to take advantage of this opportunity unlike what they did with the V20 last year.

These are all fast wireless charging too, that I don't think the LG will support as that's a Samsung thing). It's handy, but I can live without it as usb-c makes charging by cable a bit less of a hassle.\nIf you want a widespread commercial success, you need to take your head out of threads like these and think of the regular consumer. To reel in the regular consumer, you need:\n1. Marketing (brand recognition...this can be TV, bus/transit ads). More on this below, but you at least need to get some presence in general in this area.\n2. Recommendation from store employees: people walk into a store with an idea of what they want. If store employees are likely to say 'have you seen this v30...etc' then you will get initial sales going, and this of course will help with word of mouth recommendations later on (as long as there are no widespread technical issues with the original batch).\n3. Quality feel in the hands and ergonomics: you get the phone in the hands of people in the carrier store, and if it feels of good quality and is not awkward to use as they compare it to the feel and ergonomics of comparable devices they will be more likely to walk out with the V30. Folks walking in the store will be holding the V30, Galaxy S8+ and Note 8, and will go with what they feel is the best phone. Plastic and rubber does not help here, despite how folks like us appreciate the features (ie. battery) that the rubber and plastic provides. It does not matter if the very next thing they do is buy a case for the phone...its feel in the hand that sells, and this is something that Steve Jobs understood too. Samsung's fingerprint scanner will hurt them here, as that facial and retina scanner is not great to use and is finicky.\n4. Price: don't want to me putting these on for $0 on a contract right away, but they need to sell for slightly less than the S8+, the Note 8, and even the iPhone plus range. Make people feel they are getting premium for a bit of a deal. I looked at the Note 8 and saw that my carrier wants $550cdn for it on a 2 year contract. That makes the $189cdn that the V series typically goes for when new look a lot better.\nThis is what generally will make the phone successful. Plant the seeds with marketing, and then have a device that will sell itself in-store and make the salesperson's job easier. Fancy stuff like DACs, wireless charging, secondary screen or removable batteries not as important as we on these forums think. Sorry. The biggest reason to get us on board would be that we would be the techie people that our less techy people will ask about on Facebook, etc.\nIf you want to sell on advanced features, then you have to get more creative and I don't think LG has it in them, from what I have seen. Where do people sit and listen to music, read the news, etc? While using transit, etc. Show off the audio chops of the V30 on bus and transit ads. Most consumers don't really care about audio though, until they have actually tried an upgraded device. LG could even have a set of headphones connected to a Samsung and LG V30 in-store for people to compare, and make them want an audio upgrade. The biggest audio issue store buyers will have is how to transfer their music from one device to another, not audio quality...unless you have them compare it in store.\nWater resistance? You need ads that show this off (again, bus shelters, etc). Or have a phone in-store partly immersed in water (not going to happen).\nWireless charging? You need a display in-store that shows this off, and then provide a free wireless charger with the device. \nThese features that we argue about and proclaim that as 'must haves' will only get you so far. The camera is the tricky one...consumers will ask the salespeople 'which one has the best camera' or will say 'is the camera any good' and the LG needs to compete...if the salesperson says \"the V30 has the best camera right now or is as good as xyz\" then that helps.\nI get so frustrated by LGs and HTCs marketing. Apple and Samsung do a better job here for sure, but the V30 has an opportunity here to gain some ground as long as they do well with points 2, 3, and 4 that I mentioned above..hiring artsy celebrities to create abstract advertisements is not the way to go as they are more interested in showing off their directorial chops than showing off devices to the masses.", "time": "08-26-2017 04:12 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5940256", "text": "With regard to number 2\nSales people will sell the products that have behind the scenes incentives, high commissions, what's in high inventory that management tells them to sell or in some cases go for the easy sale.", "time": "08-26-2017 04:52 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5940301", "text": "I agree the V30 looks great.

The lack of an edge display, like Samsung uses, prevents inputs by accident. In order to get to the notification bar, I have to move the mobile phone once in my hand; I have to slide it down a bit.

Looking at the numbers the Note 4 sold much better than the Note 5. I think it's clear why, just look at the key features the Note 4 lost vs the features the note 5 added. The loss of removable batteries and SD cards is a big deal to \"nerds\", power users and business class users. It just is. \nI understand the mass appeal of a sealed battery phone. People don't commit to their phones for more than 2 years and the battery is fine for that long. heck, most people LEASE their phone. They buy one because it catches their eye in the store, or they see a good ad, or their friend bought one. The vast majority of people aren't going online and reading phone reviews and doing pro-con lists for competing devices. The typical consumer wants something pretty that works. Most people don't carry around a spare battery if they have a RB phone, but most people with a sealed battery phone don't carry a power bank either. Those are the rare birds. People buy whatever commercials and friends tell them is best. \nThe \"nerd\" and power user types typically don't care as much about advertising. They do their own homework, select specific features they want and don't click order or hit the store until they know what they want. That is what the Note series and V series used to be. Powerhouse phones with options, the top end, the special features, the unique-but-usable goodies that set these phones apart from the cookie-cutter mass market appeal devices like the Galaxy S and the iPhone. Transforming the \"special\" line of phones into larger versions of the flagship phone is useless when \"plus\" versions of these things already exist. \nMy prediction is that the V30 drops the removable battery and sells significantly worse than the V20 (barring some major hike in expenditure and quality of marketing, essentially rebranding the V series as the new official flagship, the new mainstream market device to beat out their own G6 for the role). The remaining V20 stock will dry up immediately as it will be the last flagship quality phone, possibly ever, to feature a removable battery. LG's mobile department will fall ever farther behind Samsung; the loyalists holding onto LG in the android space as the company willing to buck the trends and fight for the power user (headphone jack, SD card, removable battery) will no longer see a reason to stay with LG since they are notoriously bad with advertising, update speed and UI skins. \nWhat I wish would happen is that LG would see the potential crop of users who want the biggest and best with most options and therefore keep the V series elite. Convert all the Note users that are disenchanted with Notes since the 5 and 6 removed their features and the 7 blew up in their hands. Refine their \"Stylo\" tech into a S-pen like experience, incorporate it into the V30, keep the headphone jack and DAC, removable back and battery with a gasket like the Galaxy S5 to stay waterproof, and continue to improve the secondary screen implementation, and they would ABSOLUTELY OWN the \"nerd\" and power user space.

I got used to wireless charging but gave it up when I went to the G5. The Droid Maxx still has plenty of battery life when I fire it up by the way. I got used to swapping batteries again on the G5 and the IR blaster is cute but I prefer my remote controls. I returned my G5 because I was intrigued by the Nexus uP and tried it out. Loved it but it but some carrier features weren't supported so I returned and got a great deal on a new resale G5. When the V20 came out I had to have it because I missed the large screen of the 6P and wanted the Quad DAC and removable battery. This phone is a beast and I would hate to lose the removable battery especially to go to a glass phone. I would especially hate to give up the Quad DAC. IR blaster is a bonus feature that I rarely use so I don't need it and won't miss it.

Its also ok for you not to admit it to me... That's your choice.\nI could afford any phone out there just like the next guy but I chose the V20. Why?........ Not Because of the two features you mention which I agree are out there on the fringe. I bought it because it had the features that I wanted. Large Screen...not in the useless category and most of the brands have one. 64GB internal storage because 32 is not enough for me. I won't buy something without an SD unless it has 128 internal. I prefer LCD screens though that's something I can give up and would have to with the V30. I prefer the removable battery, but again not something I have to have and I've had both. Same with wireless charging....been there before and I can take it or leave it. \nThe two fringe features that made up my mind were the Quad DAC and the Wide camera. The Quad DAC is far from useless if you enjoy music. Of course not everyone cares but I'm not everyone and I have a feeling that if we had real salesmen in the world that let someone hear the difference with a demonstration more people would want that feature. I know you think the wide camera is useless but again, if we had real salespeople in the world its a feature more people would want. I can tell you that most people who try it and didn't think much of it up front really like it. Yes I have panorama....never use it, but you like it instead of wide. I don't see people jumping hoops for it.\nI buy something for the sum of it's parts. I don't need to make excuses for LG because I don't care if anyone buys it as long as they stay in business to support my product. Of course I do enjoy that others buy it because its nice for the fan base to share ideas...that's why I'm here and I try not to go negative on those that aren't part of the fan base. \nLG makes a decent product but I'll admit that like any other brand they have their share of problems. In the end I buy what I like because I'm not a sheep. I'm the same way with cars, cameras and anything else I buy. I don't play follow the leader. I do my research and buy what suits me as should you. Feel free to call what l like and the features I like useless if it makes you feel better about your purchase...I'm not about that. I think you should buy exactly what you like. Samsung makes a great product but I don't like what they have. I hate their skin, I don't like the edge screen. I'm not a fan of the Note and its gimmick...the stylus, but some people find it useful so I won't knock it because I've matured and decided if someone likes something they should get it and enjoy it. I know apple makes a decent phone but feature wise they are behind the times and as you realize there is no customization. I buy them for my wife and daughter because that's what they want and they want what other people in their inner circles want. I have one through work and I tolerate it but its not my choice. Don't ask me why, because I don't know, but I like the IPad. My daughter bought me one when the IPad air came out and I enjoy it more than an Android tablet after having owned one, but I havn tried one lately.\nIn any event, enjoy you phone and it's set of features...I promise you that I'll enjoy mine.", "time": "08-11-2017 12:36 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5919974", "text": "I'm sure you will, but the majority of people don't care about any of those features.", "time": "08-11-2017 01:00 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5920221", "text": "The majority of people don't know about any features", "time": "08-11-2017 08:03 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5920839", "text": "I guarantee you that the majority of V20 owners barely touch any of the unique features of the device.", "time": "08-11-2017 06:51 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5920910", "text": "That's a stretch....

Its also ok for you not to admit it to me... That's your choice.\nI could afford any phone out there just like the next guy but I chose the V20. Why?........ Not Because of the two features you mention which I agree are out there on the fringe. I bought it because it had the features that I wanted. Large Screen...not in the useless category and most of the brands have one. 64GB internal storage because 32 is not enough for me. I won't buy something without an SD unless it has 128 internal. I prefer LCD screens though that's something I can give up and would have to with the V30. I prefer the removable battery, but again not something I have to have and I've had both. Same with wireless charging....been there before and I can take it or leave it. \nThe two fringe features that made up my mind were the Quad DAC and the Wide camera. The Quad DAC is far from useless if you enjoy music. Of course not everyone cares but I'm not everyone and I have a feeling that if we had real salesmen in the world that let someone hear the difference with a demonstration more people would want that feature. I know you think the wide camera is useless but again, if we had real salespeople in the world its a feature more people would want. I can tell you that most people who try it and didn't think much of it up front really like it. Yes I have panorama....never use it, but you like it instead of wide. I don't see people jumping hoops for it.\nI buy something for the sum of it's parts. I don't need to make excuses for LG because I don't care if anyone buys it as long as they stay in business to support my product. Of course I do enjoy that others buy it because its nice for the fan base to share ideas...that's why I'm here and I try not to go negative on those that aren't part of the fan base. \nLG makes a decent product but I'll admit that like any other brand they have their share of problems. In the end I buy what I like because I'm not a sheep. I'm the same way with cars, cameras and anything else I buy. I don't play follow the leader. I do my research and buy what suits me as should you. Feel free to call what l like and the features I like useless if it makes you feel better about your purchase...I'm not about that. I think you should buy exactly what you like. Samsung makes a great product but I don't like what they have. I hate their skin, I don't like the edge screen. I'm not a fan of the Note and its gimmick...the stylus, but some people find it useful so I won't knock it because I've matured and decided if someone likes something they should get it and enjoy it. I know apple makes a decent phone but feature wise they are behind the times and as you realize there is no customization. I buy them for my wife and daughter because that's what they want and they want what other people in their inner circles want. I have one through work and I tolerate it but its not my choice. Don't ask me why, because I don't know, but I like the IPad.

As microSD cards are generally very reliable these days it's not an issue to be even remotely concerned about.\nJohn", "time": "08-28-2017 11:48 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5942890", "text": "Woah, you entirely misconstrued what I said and misrepresented it.", "time": "08-28-2017 11:50 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5942900", "text": "That's what you get when you refuse to explain your points and reply with an almost copy/paste of your first post which is pretty much a copy/paste of manufacturer's reasoning for not including micro SD storage.\nI've asked you twice you explain your points, if I'm misrepresenting your post how about third time lucky and you explain your points?

So you're flat out wrong claiming the security is not as good, I guess you're just not familiar with Android when you keep making these wrong claims.\nYou keep going on about speed yet you can't tell me what you need this speed for? It's not hard, you're the one that keeps telling me how you need this speed so what do you need it for? I'm not claiming micro SD cards have the same benchmark speeds as internal storage but that's not my point, it's that they don't need to be because the phones have 64GB of memory for application space and caches. Beyond that storage is likely to be needed for media and given micro SD can record 4k video then it's more than fast nough.\nThese points have been done to death but you've got it the wrong way round - almost everyone has moved back to sd card storage now apart from Apple and Google. I can easily see why manufacturers don't like SD cards and why OEMs would parrot the same incorrect points you do, it's not good for them - sd cards allow consumers to extend the life of their phones and upgrade capacities for much lower than they charge. \nJohn", "time": "08-28-2017 12:06 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5942945", "text": "My apologies, what I was trying to get across is that we've already spent to many words on this one thing.

In good light the camera shutter is much faster and won't produce a blurry image. \nThe 16mp vs 12mp thing is something most don't understand either. Smart phone cameras have very small sensor sizes, and they are limited in MP count because of it. When you increase MP you create smaller pixels on the sensor, smaller pixels don't absorb light as well. Reduce the MP count and get larger pixels that absorb more light. This is why cell phones dropped in MP count last year, because they wanted better low light performance. \nLG usually has a slightly smaller sensor than Samsung, it's why the S7/S8 handle low light better than the G5/V20/G6. \nThe 1.6 aperture will help the V30, but increasing the MP count to 16mp could negate the benefits it brings in low light because the pixels will be smaller unless the sensor itself is larger to compensate for the pixel increase. \nWe don't have all the details yet, but rumors suggest it will be no better in low light, because although higher MP it will be just as grainy and noisy in low light with as much motion blur. It would gain the ability to crop more with detail in good light when it properly exposes the image.\nJust trying to throw some useful information out while basically concluding we won't know until all details are released about the camera sensors.", "time": "08-28-2017 05:50 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5942534", "text": "Keep in mind that the V20 is already 16 megapixel so improving the aperture would be improvement assuming it is the same sensor.\nHonestly I don't rely on my cellphone for quality photos so what I already get from LG is satisfactory.

Frankly, make it a tad sexier with some vibrant eye catching color options. Call that the V30 Classic and keep your established customer base happy. \nSecond and primary model: Do the same as the G6 with the all glass, sealed case, highly water-phobic design.

If both models ship with a 4000+ mAh batter, 6-8GB of RAM (just +2 whatever Samsung ships in the Note 8) and 256GB internal storage while keeping the SD card slot and try to one-up them in every other spec category. Keep the Quad DAC of course and make the cameras even better. If possible, make it MIL-STD-810G and IP68 at the same time, but that may not be possible with a glass back for wireless charging. Still, make it as durable as humanly possible. Sammy's phones are gonna break easily and that gives you a significant competitive edge to brag about in ads. Samsung habitually half-asses their specs every single year which leaves the door wide open. Beat Samsung in every spec category while lacking none of their bells and whistles (minus the curved edges) and offering a few things they don't and LG could ship a superior flagship for the same or lower price this year. \nLastly, avoid doing the same blunder LG and Samsung always do: Ship your best phones everywhere.

I want them to keep the removable battery (possibly include the FREE battery kit with purchase to make people actually understand how useful it is), I love going from 0 to a 100 percent battery in 15 seconds, I hate waiting to top off the battery. I also would want them to stick with an IPS display because it's more practical if you are constantly on your phone, you wouldn't want to experience any burn in. The Quad DAC should definitely stay, I really DO hear the difference in quality and I really enjoy it. The 2nd screen should stay as well, it really made the V20 stand out and it's what people remember the V series for. Bezel-less design is cool but come on, make a phone that is practical to use, it needs to be comfortable to hold without accidentally touching the screen. And stay away from curved displays, the majority of people want to use screen protectors and cases; and plus the curved screens serves absolutely no purpose but is more inconvenient. Fingerprint scanner placement is PERFECT, don't move it!

If people really want wireless charging, just offer an add-on accessory for it (for example, a different back plate possibly made of plastic or something to enable wireless charging).

Sure I would love to not worry about having to charge my phone while using it heavily in 8 hours, but that's not the reality of life. Since all batteries degrade with usage, being able to replace it in a few seconds is one of the best things that is available to anyone using these phones. You don't have to make the phone big and bulky, nor do you have to send it in to do this. \nI get so damn mad every time I see or hear someone praising the \"modern design\" of these types of phones, knowing full well that they are promoting taking away features many of us hold dear to our hearts. \nMost people are going to use some type of case to prevent their phones from damage, but with a glass backed phone with curved screens it is mandatory to do this if they hope to keep their phones safe from any drops. \nLG could make the V line a real replacement for the Note series if they wanted to, and could do it without having to resort to trying to look like a Samsung phone. They could offer everything a power user wants and then some, by having a removable battery, waterproofing, headphone jack, the best cameras, speakers and all the other goodies available along with a perfectly flat screen and removable back. \nNo... It won't be a pretty and as sleek as a Galaxy iPhone.. It doesn't have to be... They have the G series to do this with. \nLG administration needs to grow up and make a great workhorse of a phone that will do everything and last, instead of just trying to be a clone of the other guys. They almost hit it out of the park with the v20 and tried to sway the dissatisfied Note 4 users with the v10... One would think that the v30 could do what both the previous models should have... But they are going to have to include a pen if they are ever going to be able to get Note users to even look at them, not a slide out keyboard. Then they are going to have to make timely updates to the phones, and really advertise them, just like the other guys and make damn sure they don't boot loop. They also have to be extremely aggressive with any carrier or store like Best Buy to ensure they have the space and presence along with the accessories to sell. \nThis is the only way they can gain meaningful market share.

I'm indeed a very good example. I was dead certain to buy a V40. Now--I will probably wait until my V20 dies. When it does, I'll look at other manufacturers, too. After all, what does LG give me now that I can't get elsewhere? Zip, zero. Customer loyalty is a great thing to squander. The last thing any intelligent vendor wants is to have their clientele demo'ing other products. Some won't come back. Playing copycat does not mean they are smart. \nAt this point, everyone does a pretty good job of the basic features. If they have nothing important to distinguish them, I'm no longer locked in.

This is what they had to say.\n\"The G6 super-wide-angle camera comes with the same sensor resolution but a slower F2.4 aperture than the main lens. As it is often the case with very wide lenses, it is softer, especially towards the edges of the frame and shows noticeably more distortion.\nImage processing is noticeably different compared to the main camera, too. The super-wide-angle appears to apply stronger noise reduction to its images, resulting in softer detail and more smeared luminance noise.\nOverall image detail and sharpness of the super-wide-angle are not on the same level as the main camera but it still offers a very convenient and easy way of fitting more of a scene into the frame at the push of a button.\"\nThey also said this about an indoor shot.\n\"Due to the slower lens aperture the camera has to increase sensitivity to ISO 1000 to capture the indoor shot below. Detail is clearly suffering and noise is getting more intrusive but overall this is still a very usable shot, even at larger image sizes.\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/lg-g6-camera-review/7\nIt may be convenient to take a shot with the wide angle lens, but it absolutely harms the quality of the image.

In my former Z3 and current Z3 tablet compact, active noise cancelling\u200b was done in concert with the phone and specific headphones. You can still get regular audio, but not the noise cancelling. I plugged the noise cancelling headphones into other 3.5mm Jack and it gave off static and played no audio. By the Z5, Sony built the noise cancelling into the phone so you could plug in whatever headphones and still get active noise cancelling.\nGoogle has a terrible track record for audio. It is only now improving Bluetooth audio using some of Sony's codecs (so when they kill the 3.5mm in the Pixel 2, you know why). They barely scrapped together a standard for USB-C charging just now and got OEMs and Qualcomm to follow.\nI don't mind if they kill the 3.5mm, but a sensible compromise is one universal standard codec that all OEMs can use and s secondary profile that allows OEMs to deliver custom sound through proprietary headphones.

The V20 seemed a solid phone and a good alternative when Samsung so badly screwed up the Note 7 but bizarrely LG decided not to take advantage of that and didn't sell the phone at all in Europe and seemed to have a limited release worldwide.\nThe LG G6 was released here but an underspecced version (32GB only, no DAC) and sold at a high price, just a bit lower than the S8 which not only has the faster Snapdragon 835 and 64GB storage but a much more eye catching design with the large edge to edge AMOLED screen. The only general interest I've seen in the G6 here is in the grey import versions which are the higher spec 64GB/DAC models and nearly half the price of the inferior spec UK models, even allowing for a official duty paid UK version needing to be higher priced it looks like LG should have been able to significantly undercut the S8. However as it stands the LG G6 barely exists here and the S8's are everywhere and that's not down to branding or advertising, it's a lower spec handset being sold for a higher spec price against a phone which is a better spec.\nI wouldn't expect the V30 to dent Samsung sales as based on the rumours so far, it doesn't seem to offer much in the way of advantages - the Note 8 has a larger screen and likely a similar physical size to the V30, it has a stylus, its dual camera is a wide angle and telephoto (which at the moment people seem to prefer the for the faux shallow DoF effect over a mix of ultra wide angle and wide angle) and it's likely it will look fancier in the flesh.\nNone of this is a dig at LG, I just don't find it constructive to claim LG's issues are only due to its branding and advertising. I don't like the Samsung design since the Note 4 and it's one of the main reasons I'm not keen on the S8+/Note 8 as I dislike the 'pretty' design and fragile bodies of these phones. I am disappointed the V30 is apparently also going to have a curved screen (I don't get the point of these at all) but I'm still hopeful for a more durable build than the Samsungs, an ultra wide angle lens (which I prefer over the telephoto) and a quad DAC in which case I'd go for one over the Samsung if it's a reasonable price and sold in the UK.

As it is often the case with very wide lenses, it is softer, especially towards the edges of the frame and shows noticeably more distortion.\nImage processing is noticeably different compared to the main camera, too. The super-wide-angle appears to apply stronger noise reduction to its images, resulting in softer detail and more smeared luminance noise.\nOverall image detail and sharpness of the super-wide-angle are not on the same level as the main camera but it still offers a very convenient and easy way of fitting more of a scene into the frame at the push of a button.\"\nThey also said this about an indoor shot.\n\"Due to the slower lens aperture the camera has to increase sensitivity to ISO 1000 to capture the indoor shot below. Detail is clearly suffering and noise is getting more intrusive but overall this is still a very usable shot, even at larger image sizes.\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/lg-g6-camera-review/7\nIt may be convenient to take a shot with the wide angle lens, but it absolutely harms the quality of the image.
