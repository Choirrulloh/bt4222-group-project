Its basically the second best gaming performer right now outperformed by the SD845. but although battery life is not bad, apparently SD845 is better in every way. This year i'd actually consider the SD845. What device do you currently own? Because that way i might advise you wait for the S10 where they will actually improve efficiently a lot with the new 7nm chips.\n\nEdit: Don't get me wrong, i love the S9 even though i owned the S7 previously. The features it includes such as the Dolby Atmos supported stereo speakers, headphone jack and the great experience Touchwiz offers in my opinion. Touchwiz just looks better than stock android which otherwise is boring in my opinion and other manufacturers are still refining their experience. And if you don't like touchwiz? Get a launcher or even change your theme to your liking. Hopefully Samsung will increase the amount of software updates due to Project Treble support too.\n\nIt's just that depending on your device and its state, i'd wait for the S10 which i reckon will be the 'holy grail' (unless they somehow screw it up). By then performance wouldn't be a issue whatsoever and battery life should increase and hopefully capacity too.\n\nAny more questions feel free to ask.
