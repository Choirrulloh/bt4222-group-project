The lag you're experiencing is not normal and, as I said, there are some procedures that could help before throwing the phone away.\n- Make sure you have the latest system version in settings - about phone - system updates.\n- Check your battery stats and your running apps and see if there is something unusual there.\n- Clear cached data in settings - storage and restart the phone.\n- Unmount the SD card and use the phone for a couple of days without it.\n- If nothing works, backup all your data and perform a factory reset.", "time": "02-19-2017 09:10 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5683533", "text": "I love this model until it lags.\nAnyway I'll try unmount card.\nThanks Javier.", "time": "02-19-2017 09:38 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5683679", "text": "Just to confirm what Javier had asked about -- the card was formatted as Portable Storage, right?\nYou mentioned 20 GB of video files -- are these files downloaded from somewhere on the web, or did you take the videos with your camera app?

Is it the quantity/size of installed apps, or is it saved media (photos, videos, music)? If it's media, then I would strongly recommend making use of cloud solutions like Google Photos and Google Play Music. Keeping media in the cloud can significantly free up your storage, and will still allow you to temporarily download certain files for offline use.

So I would suggest to go for MXP as on a complete phone level comparison, MXP is still a better and economical choice. \nNeeraj", "time": "09-20-2016 03:06 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5494580", "text": "Moto X Play have better camera than Moto G4 Plus...but the difference is not too much", "time": "10-15-2016 05:52 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "No sound in car via Bluetooth", "thread": [{"postID": "post5475968", "text": "Issue is resolved - finally after restarting the phone for what seems like the six-hundredth time we got the sound back.\nMy fathers phone is a Moto X Play and it is connected to a 2015 Chevy Equinox via Bluetooth, it was working fine but now there is no sound in the car, on the handset itself or on the other end of the call.\nThe phone dials and connects fine but there is nothing but dead air.\nI've even paired my own phone (Samsung Note5) to the car and it works perfectly - full sound all around.\nAny ideas?", "time": "10-08-2016 08:57 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5476138", "text": "Sometimes if you \"forget\" the device, then pair it again, it resets the thing and hopefully it works again.

YOU COULD JUMP TO THE END AND MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED TO CONSIDER EVERYTHING, BUT I RATHER POST ALL THE DETAILS INSTEAD OF PROVIDING THEM PIECEMEAL DURING DISCUSSION. \nI am at my wits end. Looking for help to understand and fix the issues with my Moto X-Play, SD Cards, and Marshmallow, maybe even Windows adds to the complexity here. This is the story - the earlier parts may not be 100% accurate:\nDecember: Bought Moto X-Play 16GB (my carrier doesn't offer a 32 or 64 GB model, I wished they did) and shortly thereafter in a 128 GB Samsung EVO+ . This is a class 10 card, as recommended by Motorola. I pop it into the device and get the message: This card is slow blablabla .... I am thinking WTF???!!!! .... this is a class 10 card, what more do you want? Further research indicates that with a w/r speed of 80/20, this card might not be top of the line class 10. I chose to use it nevertheless and decide to just use it for certain non-critical apps and for the storage of photos and stuff. I install ES File Explorer. I am seeing the SD card, I am able to install some apps there and put some media files on it.\nEnd of January: I am updating to Marshmallow and leaving the country for 3.5 months (I am mentioning this because you might wonder why it took me so long to deal with this ....).\nAt some point, I am running out of space for photos. I notice that I can't access the SD card. It shows in Settings/Storage & USB, but I can't drill down. I can also see it in ES File Explorer, but again, can't access the sd card's file structure. I am trying different File Explorers (Solid Explorer), to no avail. I end up manually deleting the photos after back-up, but this issue keeps occurring:\n1: I can't move the photos from the internal storage to the SD card, despite the SD card showing in Storage &USB\n2. I can't set the photo application to saving the photos directly to the SD card\nMay: Upon my return, I am talking to Motorola about this. During the chat they get me to adopt the SD card as internal storage. At first, nothing changes: I am not seeing the SD card capacity added to internal storage. I think it took restarting the device for the full capacity (16 + 128 GB) to show both in Settings/Storage and Solid Explorer (I dumped ES, terrible with all the ads).\nJune: However, I do notice that the device is somewhat sluggish now. I am traveling quite a bit and the phone is my main means of connectivity, I want to improve the situation and decide to buy a better SD card (Sandisk Extreme + 64 GB, [95/90]).\na) I unmount the 128 GB Samsung SD card.\nb) I install the 64 GB Sandisk as internal memory, which seems to work\nc) I try reformatting the 128 GB SD card for further usage on my Windows 7 desk top: the drive is visible in Windows Explorer only intermittently. It cannot be accessed in any way (\"Insert disk into drive\"). I try the same thing with my Windows 10 laptop (upgraded from Windows 8): the drive is not visible at all. I am trying two different adapters. Just for the sake of curiosity, I try the same thing with the 64 GB card: same result \u2013 invisible to Windows. An old 16 GB card works fine with the adapters and is visible and accessible in Windows Explorer.\nThat same night, a part of the tray that holds the SD and SIM cards pops off. I bring my device to the carrier for repair. I tell them about the SD card issues. \nJuly 8: My carrier admits to having lost my phone. They give me a new one (and want to charge me $150 for a new phone .... WTF?????!!!!! The device is under manufacturer's warranty AND I have an extended warranty plan AND you lost it!)\nI am setting the new phone up, with the 64 GB card in it. The device lets me know that the card is slow. WTF??????!!!! So, I am talking to Motorola wanting to know why. \na) I can't format neither the 128 nor the 64 GB card. Did Moto X-play render them useless? I am told I should be able to reformat them. They have no explanation why they do not appear in Windows Explorer \"It depends on the pc\". (I tried two already). \nb) my device now thinks that a highspeed class 10 UHS-1 rated card is still too slow. I didn't get that message the first time I installed it (into the old device). If that is really true, then what type of card should I be using? I don\u2019t get an answer to that.\nWe reset the device twice: \n1.\tWithout card in it through Settings/Backup & reset/Factory data reset. In Settings/Storage & USB, the cards shows as unsupported.\n2.\tWith card through Recovery Option after powering the device off. The card still shows as unsupported.\nMotorola sends me back to the carrier to have them send the device in for repairs. (I am thinking I might be caught in a novel of Kafka).\nThe guy at the carrier\u2019s kiosk goes into Settings/Storage & USB card. Despite the \u2018unsupported\u2019 status, he chooses the sd card and is able to format it as internal storage. All looks good. (I didn\u2019t look at the values of storage used at the time). \nI go back home and decide to start all fresh, instead of restoring the back-up of my old device from Google drive. After having installed most of the apps that I used to have my previous device, the new one is showing 26.80GB used. WTF????!!!!! These are less apps than I had before on 16 GB internal storage and NO APPLICATION DATA, NO MEDIA FiLES. \nI check under Settings/Storage & USB:\nDevice Storage: 26.80 GB\nAndroid OS: 5.11 GB (this looks normal)\nInternal storage: 3.01 GB used of 10.89 (this looks normal)\nApps: 2.59 GB\nCached data: 22.63 MB\nSandDisk SD card: 18.67 used of 58.53 (that doesn\u2019t look normal)\nso here is what the device sees there: \nApps: 1.21 GB\nImages: 6.60 MB\nVideos: 4.00 KB\nAudio: 20.00 KB\nOther: 3.43 MB\nCached Data: 43.03 MB\nthis means there is de facto less than 1.5 GB in data on that SD card, but the device sees 17 GB more. I am not even talking about the 5.5 GB that seem to be missing from the card's label value of 64 GB. \nSo \u2026 what to do? \na)\tAbout the 64 GB SD card - How can I get rid of the ghostdata?\nb)\tShould I configure as internal storage and if not, how can I get photos to directly save to portable SD card?\nc)\tAbout the 128 GB SD card? Return to retailer? It\u2019s still under warranty.\nd)\tGet a new SD card with even better specs?\nAll leads appreciated.", "time": "07-09-2016 10:56 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5298814", "text": "So where are you at now with your situation?

If not though then you will have a 30 second wait without signal. \nThis doesn't really matter when turning on the phone but what I have found is if I loose signal in a building or when driving then it will take much longer to reacquire the signal than other phones. This is because it wastes so much time looking for 4g first. \nFor now I've switched off 4g and set to 3g only but seems a daft solution.

I have tried several different cables, and several different usb ports on my computer.\n**edit\nI think it's resolved.

No. Is it something that bothers me so much that I cannot stand the phone? Hell no.

First thing you notice is that it looks stunningly beautiful. The stock android provided is not very good. You cannot totally mute (sound & vibration both) from the dropdown menu bar. You have to go to settings to do it. Screen lock when pattern is opted, you can go on trying. It doesn\u2019t say to send the new pattern to your e mail. Ascending ringtone is not there. Clearing open apps has to be done manually one by one. Data cannot be managed from the dropdown menu. The moment wifi is unavailable; the mobile sim data takes its place. Again to close it you have to go to settings. The audio tunes for ringtone are dumb. But thanks to moto migrate I could get all my data in to the x play. The battery, because of which I bought the phone, is really very very good. After 100% charge I had to start using x play at 4 am. That day I was out till 11:30 pm. I used it properly as I did my redmi 1s, calls, whatsapp, net, games. In the night the battery still had enough juice approx 15%, to last for another 4 hours as the battery indicator said. This thing has won my heart. Now I don\u2019t have to carry power pack everywhere, which was a pain in the back. The camera is too good. The only thing you need to keep in mind is to take pics in normal light. The normal light pics are better than one plus one (which I compared). For gaming I didn't get lots of time to play except 8 ball pool, zombies & some simple games. That was fine. The front facing speaker is what a relief, relief of not setting one of your fingers on the back to direct the sound in the front. The display is very good. Call quality is crisp and clear and loud. As for now I think I made a good decision.

I have looked at several hardware info apps and the gulf between the number of sensors installed on these phones is quite big - granted, the majority of the ones on the Nexus 5 are going to be used rarely in everyday usage scenarios (e.g. barometer, gravity sensor etc.). The gyroscope is the biggest omission here but also notable is the lack of a dedicated step counter, though whether that impacts apps like Google Fit I am yet to find out - will report back later today on that.\nThe build quality is about the same. Moto X Play has rattly (i.e. loose fitting) buttons and yet the Nexus 5 has a much inferior haptic feedback (the vibration engine is noisier and doesn't generate as pleasing vibrations - hey, stop it with your dirty mind!).\nThe battery and camera are miles better than the Nexus 5, I can already tell.

But all others phones in that time had big cons and seemed a bad cost n benefit. But, except for the gyro, I don't miss almost anything on the MotoX Play. If you go by the specs, its better wait for the next Nexus, which will be revealed soon... But what can I tell is, even having a 2014 processor, not power efficient using 28nm, a poor world wide radio and not the best cortex design, with just little 2gb ram and 32bit Android, its a solid user experience. I'm also a S6 user, and I can't see any every-day difference on performance.\nWould be great to have back a barometer, a 64bit design for Android M or an even better world wide 4G coverage? Of course, and this come for a price that an average user would almost never get benefit of it...\nGreat cost n benefit for Motorola.

It's ACCEPTABLE, but nowhere near even a 2 year old Apple or Samsung device in picture quality or software, I'm sorry. \nScreen: it's possible I just got a dud. It's not terrible, I'm just not impressed. Perhaps my \"Made in Brazil\" XT-1563 is not up the standard of the other ones reviewed here. Different materials?\nOther things that don't affect my user experience yet, but leave me scratching my head:\n- no wifi ac\n- 32 bit android\nThis phone is just ok.

That is literally my only complaint about the build quality.\n2) It's great. Nice and bright. Colours look nice and saturated. Contrast is high. It's nice and sharp too. Compared to the Nexus 5 display, it's definitely a slight improvement. It's not an AMOLED, but it's one of the best FHD IPS LCDs out there.\n3) Not as fast as the Nexus 5 and the Snapdragon 800, but it's not horrible experience either. Animations are a bit choppier than you would expect from a modern flagship. The majority of 3D games run fine, just again, not quite as well as the Nexus 5.

By the way I had some Motorola app updates (including Moto app, Gallery app, Camera app and more) that I could install but Google Play Store didn't automatically install these updates for me. I came across them accidentally when searching for Motorola apps in the Play Store. Updated them all. Gallery and Camera apps get some new features and the rest offer bug fixes, so worth installing.\nMore performance tips for ya guys/gals:\n1) If you're using Adguard and want the permanent notification gone, there's a way to do that. First, go the settings menu in the app, navigate to general and find the notification setting in the list. Simple as that!\n2) If you want to improve the experience even further using Adguard you can go to settings, navigate to advanced and tick the box that says 'Filter DNS requests'. This has improved performance further and has seemingly decreased the battery impact of Adguard slightly.\n3) If you want to use an alternative to Adguard you can download Firefox and use any one of the adblocking add ons. Probably Adblock is the best bet as that has been specifically optimised for Android. This has the benefit of not requiring the permanent VPN icon.\n4) Another alternative is Adblock Browser, currently in beta. A simple Google search will lead you to the download link. This is based upon the Firefox browser so the experience is largely the same as going the Firefox + add on route.\n5) To improve launcher animations (notably the app drawer expand/contract animation) you can install Nova Launcher from the Play Store. This seems to be better optimised than the Google Now launcher. Animations in the launcher become noticeably smoother. I think this last point is really important as it shows that software optimisation can really help improve performance on this device, so there is hope that future updates to various apps will boost animation smoothness and general responsiveness.\nSent from my XT1562 using Tapatalk", "time": "08-31-2015 03:42 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4651557", "text": "Thanks for the heads up on the Motorola app updates.

Sure, the G is pushing far fewer pixels, but it's also packing a much less powerful CPU and the same amount of RAM, and yet every time the G feels like the faster phone. That's a shame, because in most other areas the Play is a joy to use. When you consider all the engineering effort made by Google in recent years to eliminate lag in Android, it's slightly surreal to be going back to 2012-13 levels of stutteriness in a current handset.\"\nThat is indeed a damn shame. The build quality issues I've been reading about coupled with the above has unfortunately placed this firmly on my don't buy list.

But even at that price I don't think expecting less stutter, no iffy buttons, no gaps collecting dust is truly too much to ask for. Combine all this with lenovo totally replacing the original software team bringing all future software updates into uncertain territory, and there's no way I can possibly feel like this phone is a confident purchase.\nI don't know what's going on in Android OEM land these days, they all seem to be dedicated to shooting themselves in the foot in some significant way or another and not a single one this year to date has had the wherewithal to just sit down and say \"hey we just made an awesome phone, so let's not ruin all the positives by putting [insert big mistake here] in it\" \nIs that one simple bit of common sense seriously too much to ask for?", "time": "09-01-2015 07:47 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4655045", "text": "@Cakefish - Thanks for checking it out - nothing untoward in your results that I can see.

People who want higher res and bigger screens can cast screen or hotspot to a computer.\nExternal micro-SD slot.
