One thing I can think of that is different is that I'm on my 5GHz WiFi network now, though I'm definitely not ready to point fingers.\n\nI'm going to go through and disable the following, one by one, and see how my device sleeps overnight with each gone:\n\nActivity Recognition (RW specific)\nAssist\nLocation Reporting\nHelp Improve Motorola Products + Moto Care\n\nAnd if I still have odd wakelocks, GPS after that.", "time": "1st December 2013, 01:21 PM", "postID": "post48026106", "replies": []}]}, {"text": "thank you for your review. could you comment on the bass audio output of this phone?

Other apps syncing/polling? I mean, I don't have a whole lot but Facebook/Google+ sync, Gmail, Weather bug updates hourly... all of that adds up to about 1% or so per hour in ideal circumstances, so 3 days is about all I'll ever get - and that has always been consistent, I've never owned a phone I could get much under 1% per hour if I have normal polling/syncing stuff running.\n\nNot doubting, just interested.", "time": "1st December 2013, 12:11 AM", "postID": "post48010858", "replies": []}, {"text": "The processor arrangement doesn't have anything to do with GPS.
