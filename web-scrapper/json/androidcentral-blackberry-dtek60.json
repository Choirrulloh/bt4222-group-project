It'll come with a 2560x1440 screen instead.And of course, BlackBerry's software will replace TCL's, so you can ignore the middle part.Phone can be used upside down, there are earpieces and microphone top and bottom. Probably applies to the DTEK50 as well since they are pretty much the same design.Performance was described as \"balanced\". There are some benchmarks in pictures.Some warmth has been felt (around 43.3 C) near the camera after running 15 minutes of NBA 2K17. So I'm expecting people and \"expert reviewers\" running around yelling \"ZOMG IT OVERHEATS\" like the Priv.Storage is eMMC, NOT UFS 2.0 like most flagships of 2016, so it's a bit slower. Reviewer says it's acceptable in subjective overall performance.Camera samples near the bottom in the article. But should note that this is with TCL's software, BlackBerry's version may have a different tuning. So far night performance actually looks decent.Chinese version comes with both JBL headphones (reviewer didn't like them too much though) and a Quick Charge 2.0 charger. Don't think DTEK60 will come with the headphones, but based on B&H's listing earlier, early orders will come with BlackBerry's QC 2.0 charger as a gift.7", "time": "10-16-2016 11:46 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5514397", "text": "To be honest, most earphones that come with phones are not great.
