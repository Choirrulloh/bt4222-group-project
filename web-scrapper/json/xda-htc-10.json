Heck, I even sold my grey HTC 10 just after a month!\n\r\nJust last month, I stumbled through Lazada Malaysia and got surprised that they were selling the HTC 10 (unlocked) for USD300!!!

To cut this short, I bought my second HTC 10 (silver this time around)\n\r\nI still have my other phone (Huawei P10) and will definitely sell this due to the crappy UI. \n\r\nAnyway, here's my ranking of my favorite HTC flagship:\r\nHTC One (M7) - 10/10 -- this is THE perfect 10! fast camera, great in lowlight, wide angle rear AND selfie camera, boomsound. I think this phone was 3 years ahead of its time so reviewers don't get why HTC decided to put these features.\n\r\nHTC 10 - 9/10 -- everything you want on a phone is here. My only gripe is the boomsound. I can't feel the **oomph** you hear on the M7 and M8. Also, IP67 could have been a nice addition (so potential consumers won't complain it doesn't have one!)\n\r\nHTC One M8 - 9/10 -- the dual camera (which again, HTC was ahead of the time AND reviewers were scratching their heads coz of this \"gimmicky\" bokeh images) But since Apple says it's an important feature, reviewers are going ga-ga over the bokeh now. Sheesh.\r\n-- Boomsound! gahhh!!! Nobody can beat the awesome boomsound! The bass is punchy, the speakers are very loud. Just wow!\n\r\nHTC One A9 -- 7/10 --yes, I bought this phone since it looks like an iPhone. There's this side of me who wants to try an iPhone just for the sake of having one and good thing HTC built this. LOL. Camera is just good at best. The ultrapixel selfie camera is great. Speaker is average (no boomsound here). The battery went from OK to MEH after the nougat update.\n\r\nHTC One M9+ -- 7/10 -- so much disappointment mainly because of the main camera. Not sure what HTC was thinking in putting a toshiba sensor on their phone. My first phone to have a fingerprint sensor and yes, the fingerprint recognition is faster the the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S6 (same year it was released).\n\r\nI didn't mention anything about the sound quality when plugged in through the headset jack.

Same goes for the screen. Some are disappointed, Others claim the screen is just as good as the s7 edge but just not as vibrant which may or may not be as pleasing to the eyes as the vibrancy of the s7 edge will........ others are very happy with the display!
