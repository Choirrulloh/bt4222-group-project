You can Google that page \"APN SETTING FOR AT&T and the ONE PLUS 3 PHONE\" keep a copy of the IMEIA # for future reference just in case and good \ud83c\udf40 luck\nPS The person who provided this information on the web seemed to think that this Data base issue which is the reason you aren't able to simply get LTE without this chicanery is all sbout AT&T not liking the fact that this is a unlocked phone not sold by them so this is their way of discouraging their customers from going outside and I am in agreement with that thinking. \ud83d\ude08", "time": "08-22-2016 04:44 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5306855", "text": "I get LTE with either APN with ATT. \nI would do a hard reboot.

(If early days of DOS and programming in BASIC on the Commodore 64 didn't do it!) \nThere are lots of great instructions out there on how to use ADB, and what the commands do. So when something goes wrong, and you're looking for help, you can ask specific questions, and clarify using more specifics when asked about what you did. \nOn the flip side, sometimes it's nice to just push the button and have it do the work for you. Personally, I have ADB installed system-wide in Windows 10, drivers installed, and did my 3.5.3 sideload by typing ADB commands in. BUT I also have the OnePlus 3 toolkit installed (with a DOS shell, not a clicky GUI like this) so I can tap a couple of keys and do backups and such without having to think about it.\nDifferent tools for different people.

You may want to use Google Photos to backup all of your photos right now: https://support.google.com/photos/an...DAndroid&hl=en.

If so, then they'll sync automatically to the new phone once you log into it with the same Google account. It's trickier if those contacts were saved only to the Verizon account or to the local Phone account, because those accounts don't sync to Google. The Verizon account syncs to the Verizon Cloud, and as I mentioned, you might have problems accessing it once you leave Verizon. The local Phone account doesn't sync anywhere.

But I was already hours into the setup process from the FDR the night before.\nI installed 4.0.3 and wiped the system cache, then continued with my installation and tweaking process. At some point later in the day it became apparent that my hotspot would turn itself off after just a few minutes. Also, my gestures (which were enabled) did not work. While a reboot cleared the gesture issue, the hotspot issue remains.\nEarlier (on 4.0.1 I believe), I had an instance where the hotspot would turn itself off after a few minutes of streaming WatchESPN to my iPad. After re-enabling the hotspot and having the same thing occur several times in a row, I gave up on WatchESPN. All other hotspot activity (which connects my wifi iPad... for checking email, watching Youtube, etc.) functioned normally with no interruptions. So I figured that was a fluke.\nNow, after the update to 4.0.3, I am getting continuous hotspot interruptions every few minutes. I've scanned through the various settings wondering if there's a timeout somewhere that I overlooked (such as the one that turns off the hotspot after 5 minutes if no device is connected), but haven't found any other control over the hotspot connection. And the one that exists cannot be modified, to the best of my knowledge.

What a cluster____....Needless to say, I then called Oneplus customer service and rehashed the whole ordeal. I was hoping someone could help me locate the device I ordered and paid. I was told to call UPS, that they were doing the delivery. I called UPS Customer Service for a tracking search. UPS came back and said that the label had been created on June 16th, but they were waiting on Oneplus to provide the merchandise to ship. UPS said the delivery date of the label states for delivery on Monday, June 20th. I called back 1+ Cust Service and explain that \"THEY\" are the one's we all are waiting on... So now Oneplus has created a Case/Ticket number and their inquiry team suppose to contact me in 24-48 hrs.........Are you freaking kidding me??!!!!! Oneplus had no issue accepting my money immediately on June 14th, now I am having to investigate, research and track down my merchandise and it is June 23rd and I am told to wait 24 to 48 \"more\" hours for an email???? This company can SUCK IT!!!

That's the only reason that I can imagine that they had to create a ticket to track down what happened.\nI also have a problem with cards being charged before devices ship. It's one thing if you're doing a Kickstarter since you're providing startup money with no guarantee of product, but it's another when you're charging someone for a product. Put a temporary authorization on the card then charge when they ship.\nAs an aside, OP's site says the 3 'ships immediately,' and when I continued through the checkout process, it says that an order sent to my (US) address can get here July 1 with expedited shipping, or the 4th without, which suggests that they can have a device ready to ship within a business day or two.", "time": "06-24-2016 11:18 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5238179", "text": "Yes, I agree 100% It seems there is a break down in communication in all three directions: 1+, the Logistics Co and the consumer.

But depending on which one the focus is on, they update differently.\nWhen the focus is on Waze, Maps does not update anything, but you still get the next turn pop-up alert as if the app was running but not on the screen. Otherwise, the Maps next turn and distance info at the top of the screen does not update at all, and of course, the moving map does not update. In the above example, the focus is on Waze (Maps next turn distance is off by 1.3 miles)\nHowever, when the focus is on Maps, Waze operates normally with the exception that the moving map does not operate. Otherwise, all the upcoming turn info and distances, etc. continue to function and update normally.\nOne thing I noticed is that unless I'm watching the screen for moving map updates (can't use next turn distance because that works in Waze when Maps is the focus), it's not readily apparent which app has focus. And if I change focus to Maps, it's very easy for Maps to interpret the tap as the desire to add another navigation point.\nI have more play work to do to satisfy my curiosity using both nav apps in split view. But the above is what I observed in a 20-30 minute drive today.\nOne other thing I noticed is that while I normally run in portrait mode when running a single nav app, for split view when running dual nav apps, I prefer landscape.

I also found out the option to take a screen shot from a long press of the power button (which brought up several options including taking a screen shot under 3.2.8) is not there in 4.0.1. However, I can still take a screen shot by pressing volume down and the power button at the same time. The 3 finger swipe is obviously the preferred method in this scenario. Maybe I just need to play with it more and see if it's a vertical 3 finger swipe or a horizontal swipe when in landscape mode, or if it works in split screen portrait mode.\nEdit: after playing with split view, I had no trouble making a 3 finger screen shot regardless what orientation I had the phone.

If I were faced with both, I'd take the 3T.\nAgain, phones like the 3T are great! I own an Honor 8 so I definitely get the whole bang for your buck thing.

How up to date are updates with this phone? Not a deal breaker, although I do like bragging I have the newest updates.\nThe company is in China? Would repairs be a problem? Or returns if for some reason it's a dud? And can I buy a Square Trade policy on it?\nI understand that the Dash charger is fast, but can I also use a regular slower charger? Or do I have to buy extra Dash chargers? I like to keep spares scattered around my car and work.\nLastly, I like being able to buy accessories for my phones, like pretty cases. I'm hoping there are some decent colorful cases for this. Also, this one may be silly, but I am used to having a wrist strap on my phones, so that if I'm on a bus or something I'm less likely to drop it. Does this phone have a hole for one? Or is there a case that has an opening? On the Nexus, I have a Seidio case with an exoskeleton, and slip the loop of the strap over one of the \"legs\".

Long live Pebble!\nOK, advertisement aside, with the new PTS, the new Nougat upgrade, the new phone (OP3), I am having a problem and cannot recall when it began. Basically, I use Timely as my alarm clock. I remember with the GS4 and PS, I would faithfully get a gentle buzz on my wrist when the Timely alarm was going off. I never got a 30 minute alert on the PS of an upcoming alarm, or not that I can recall.\nAt some point that changed. I now get an alert on my PTS that I have an alarm set to go off in 30 minutes (I'd like to turn that off if I can figure out what app is generating the alert) but I am not getting an alert on my PTS when the alarm itself is going off on my phone... not that I need it since the phone wakes me up. But I'd like to restore that function should I someday accidentally kill alarm sounds. \nNow I normally wake up before the alarm goes off, so it's rarely a problem and I seldom remember about missing the wrist buzz. But I let it go today to check (remembered because I got the 30 minute pre-alarm buzz) and the PTS did not buzz when the alarm actually went off.\nHas anyone seen these issues and found a fix?\n1) kill the pre-alert?\n2) have the PTS buzz when the alarm goes off on the phone.\nI can dig out my recently retired PS, pair it to my phone and see if the change in Pebble hardware induced the change I'm seeing in the PTS.

But I'm undecided if I want to go that route or learn some new skills (which has its own perils).\nI know what a clean install is from a pc perspective and am quite familiar with that process. But I have no clue how to do the same thing to my phone. \nI have too much going on right now to deal with cleaning up a botched upgrade.

From start to finish took between 10 and 15 minutes including optimizing 155 apps.\nInterestingly, a couple of stock icons were missing (clock and contacts).

I did not have to input any of my APN settings which is interesting, based on the experience of others where their settings were wiped.\nAfter the installation and reboot, I simply had to choose my launcher (Nova), then went into settings and tweaked a few things (split screen on the recents button (long press), etc. I'll be a few days tweaking, most likely.

Go into settings and navigate to and select \"About phone\"\n2. Scroll down to \"Build number\"\n3. Keep tapping \"Build number\" until you see the following message \"You are now a developer!\"\n4. Go back to the main settings menu. Navigate to and select \"Developer options\" right above \"About phone\". Make sure developer options are turned on. Caution... if you are not sure about a specific setting, leave it alone.\n5. Find and select \"Aggressive Wi-Fi to Cellular handover\". This will allow your phone to switch to your data when the WiFi signal is weak. Turn this option on if you want that. \n6. Scroll a little further down and you will find \"Cellular data always active\". Turn this on if you want to keep your mobile data active, even if WiFi is active. Again, use developer options very carefully. Make sure you research a setting very well before you play with it. I have actually used developer options to turn off the animations on my phone. I'm one of those users that doesn't care about animations and my phone looking cool in the process of doing something; I care more about my phone just working and not annoying me with needless animations. \nIf the Developer options regarding your data and wifi to data handoff do not work, than make sure you have the write APN settings for Vodafone\nLink 1: Vodafone UK APN Settings - APN info and Step by Step configuration. I couldn't find the date this was posted. You could always contact customer service. \nLink2: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Vodafone+U...v33-4__&ia=web. This is my search page. \nIf the APN settings are not an issue maybe it is reception? Or it could be an issue of what Vodafone data bands are used in your area. In the USA my OnePlus 3 does not receive all of the 4g bands that AT&T/T-Mobile uses. It will pick up the major bands. Also, my OnePlus 3 is able to make voice calls, send/receive text messages using the Verizon Wireless network. OnePlus 3/3T is not able to use the USA CDMA data bands. \nWelcome to Android... I hope you like it. I like android os because it is very customizable.

The colors were way off 2. they used a very old form of Pentile pixel configuration on a 5.5\" 1080p AMOLED display, which results in the screendoor effect and has some fairly noticable problems when trying to do things like rendering text. This issue is heavily mitigated by using a higher resolution, such as 1440p - although this configuration would be more acceptable on a smaller display, such as the sub 5\" category for the same reason as 1440p on a 5.5\" is the defacto minimum for that type of configuration. \nSo, they fixed the color issue with a software update that pushed it well past the minimum expectations for 2016 phones and into the good category - it actually fell in just behind the Nexus 6P, which was one of the best non-Samsung devices using a Samsung AMOLED display at the time. \nTL-DR - because OP doesn't properly understand display technology, they had two major blunders on the display front that would make it noticeably inferior to even the OnePlus One, but especially devices with great displays, such as the last few years of iPhones, Samsungs, the 2015 Nexus phones, etc. They fixed one of the blunders, but the other is hardware and not fixable.

The iPhone is the standout for long term support and my main reason for iOS interest. Even the Pixel drops OS support after 2 years. But I just couldn't make the iOS move. I see enough of that on my iPad mini2.\nSo to me, the value buy became the OP3 with a near pure Android experience and a reasonable price that would hopefully allow me to upgrade in a couple of years and, after buying 2 phones, still be below the 2016 flagship price point.

With an analog watch, I can simply glance at it and my brain recognizes the time from the hand position without having to read it... if that makes any sense.\nIn the same vein, using contact widgets, I have to read the contact to remember which one I wish to call whereas with the long press of a number on the dial pad, I simply have to remember which button to long press. If that makes any sense to you guys. \nWhile there's virtually no time difference in one method vs the other, one takes more brain power than the other.", "time": "11-05-2016 06:41 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5547259", "text": "Yes, I group all of my Direct Dial widgets in a \"Speed Dial\" folder on my primary homescreen.

The number of keypresses may even be less, because with the Dialer, you usually have to tap the Dialer app on the homescreen, then select the keypad (since most dialers default to the contact list), and then long-press the digit -- that's two taps and a long-press.

Interestingly, opening the camera was about the same speed between the 2 devices, which was almost instant. I didn't have time to compare how long it took to take a picture, and perhaps that is where I might find a difference.\nI really would have liked Huawei to have updated the 6P for 2016 as the 2016 Nexus with the latest Soc, better (faster in operation camera, waterproofing, etc.).

That being said, I'm on a learning curve on two fronts, moving from a Samsung environment (the GS4) to the OP3, and more importantly, moving from Android 5.0.1 to Android 6.0.1.\nA few questions:\n1) I had my alert slider set to the mid position (priority) overnight and enabled alarms and repeat callers as well as calls from starred contacts and messages from starred contacts. However, my alarm (set via Timely) did not go off this morning and I assume it has something to do with the alert slider. Any clues what I should tweak to make my alarm work? Or maybe this is a Doze issue?\n2) I am not much of a fan of the default dialer. I like to set speed dialers via the dial pad, not from a favorites list. Have I overlooked a setting or do I need to install a 3rd party dialer? If a 3rd party dialer, any good suggestions? I've used a number of them in the past on the GS4 but always went back to the stock dialer after a time because many of the default actions called ithe stock dialer back up, so I figured I might as well just stick with the stock dialer.\n3) I use a Pebble Steel watch. I seem to lose BT connectivity occasionally. I have to wonder if that's something to do with Doze. Where can I modify Doze settings? I haven't found anything about Doze in the phone settings. Yet.\nOtherwise, I am well on my way to getting my OP3 setup. I decided to continue using Nova Prime vs the OP launcher. I thought I'd save my settings from the old phone, but that turned out to be a bad idea since I have yet to install many of the apps I had on the old phone, so I reset NP, then copied over the main NP settings from Nova settings. That works for me.\nI noticed an anomaly with Messenger and Tesla Unread (for my unread message count balloon). Even with all messages read, it still showed one unread message in the balloon. So I switched to Textra and all looks good.\nInitially, I had issues with the FPS on my OP3. But it turns out that I was not setting my FPS up correctly. I was trying to use my finger tip instead of my finger print (the whirl). In addition, my finger tips are pretty dry and cracked and were very poor choices to use to setup my FPS. While I could set it up eventually, it was unreliable. When I used the whirl area for FPS setup, my FPS has been absolutely reliable and extremely fast.\nI've had no rebooting issues yet when using Waze or Google Maps. I hope my luck holds.\nThus far, I've not found any bugs that affect my usage. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the OP3. Maybe I'll get brave and try a community build after I'm fully setup and functional ... and comfortable. \nI'm currently set up using sRGB for my display (never did get the sRGB slider to show after installing 3.2.7 and doing a FDR with sRGB enabled). Believe it or not, I haven't really noticed that much difference between default and sRGB. But perhaps that may have something to do with my brightness settings (more or less mid-range). Anyway, I'm still very early in my setup process and finding my happy place in the OP3 world.\nLast, while 64GB is likely plenty of storage for me, I'm used to having spare capacity with my 64GB SD card in my 32GB GS4. So I feel a little naked without that (SD card kept my pics and media data). I'd feel a bit more comfy if the OP3 has 128GB storage. But hey, I figure for the price, I can buy a new OP5 in a couple of years and be up-to-date and have that increased storage and still be ahead of the game vs buying a 2016 flagship from Apple, Samsung, LG, or Google.\nI looked at a V20 the other day when I went into the store to get my OP3 set up with a new nano sim. I have to say, the v20 is impressive. But IMO, the OP3 surpasses it in value. If LG would make a Google Play edition (with similar OS updating as a Nexus), I'd love to have that removable battery, IR blaster, and 5.7 inch screen.. as long as it doesn't bootloop.

So I switched the alert slider to the silent position while the screen was asleep, and promptly saw the circling dots commence indicating a reboot was in progress.

You can get them extremely easily in India.\nThe price point is superb for the performance and features.\nThe performance is just top of the charts. And it stays relatively cool through World Of Tanks Blitz, whereas my previous phone, the Xiaomi Mi3 felt like it might start melting any moment after a couple of minutes.\nThe biggest draw is the Dash Charge. Example: I woke up late, and hadn't put the phone to charge the previous night. Battery at 48%. Not gonna be enough for the day. Got ready in about 20 minutes after plugging the phone. Went to it, and it had charged to 94%. The charger slows down at 80% and reverts to slower charge, because that's how the physics of Li-Ion batteries work. So yeah, you won't last really long on a single charge, but the charger ensures that you can top up in a flash.\nThe 6 GB of RAM is a little excessive. The phone can't really make use of it anyway, and no matter what you read online or what people say, you will never get the complete benefit of it. \nThe lack of expandable storage hurts if your phone is the only computing device on hand like me and you use it for heavy downloads, but that's just me.\nThe ergonomics are excellent, and though it feels like you might cut your hand on the edges, you won't. Buy a good bumper case if your heart breaks at the sight of the slightest damage to your device. The metal finish can dented and bumped easily even if you drop it just one foot.\nThe display is adequate, though it could've been brighter. It suffers in sunlight a little. The supplied screen guard feels a little off, because it doesn't cover the edges and you're left with a little gap in the screen; I didn't really get why they did that....\nThe camera is okay, but the software isn't like Xiaomi or Samsung when it comes to processing, so photos don't really have an oomph in them. But they're solid and a little tweaking in an editor will help them. Detail resolved is excellent.\nThe software is okay, but it doesn't really break boundaries in capability. It's close to stock android. But I've been used to Xiaomi's MIUI so it must be that speaking.\nWhat else? Wi-Fi performance seems off sometimes, but no one else has complained. The software can be modded without voiding your warranty, which is nice.\nIf there's anything else you wanna know, reply here.", "time": "10-06-2016 11:09 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5469687", "text": "Nice summary!

I have no issue with the s7 edge(just so you know) , just trying to put into context how good this phone is if you want responsiveness and a lightning quick charge.\nAlso, updates are thick and fast. Maybe not to the next android, but their own changes and updates have real world feel. Anyway, have a look at this from phone buff.

If you have friends or colleagues with Android phones I suggest you ask them what they like about them and see if you can try them out. That's always helped me out immensely. For example I'd never owned a Motorola phone and weren't at all on my radar. Then a friend was showing me his 2013 Moto X and it completely sold me based on Moto Display and the near-stock Android UI. I bought a used one later that week.\nThat being said, I've owned iPhones (5s, and my wife has the 6s) and Androids and currently own the OP3. I also have an iPad, MS Surface and a Mac Mini that I don't really use anymore. For the money, the OP3 is a terrific phone. My observations having owned both iOS and Android phones is that iOS apps tend to be more polished (although Android seems to be catching up) but the biggest thing for MY usage patterns is I prefer the notifications on Android SO much more than iOS. That feature more than anything else really steers me towards Android. I also find iCloud photos to be a nebulous cluster**** except for the shared albums which is really handy.\nFinally, you WILL get better after sales support with an iPhone. I actually had to return my first OP3 due to a defect and it turned out ok but there's no doubt I'd have preferred to have been able to walk into a store and exchange it.\nLike I said - difficult question to answer but given you are already a Google services consumer the jump to Android probably won't be too painful for you.

They both revolve around an app system which allows you to do pretty much everything and anything on your phone. The biggest difference is presentation, and software updates. iOS puts everything on your phone front and center on the home screens. To find the app you want, you swipe across home screens. A few choice apps by Apple's design are in the dock for easy access.\nAndroid tucks most apps away in the app drawer, but you can add any app you want to a home screen (and anywhere you want, not necessarily in a row). You can customize your dock however you want it. You can add widgets that give you both quick glance info and launch the associated app (I think iOS has this now in 10, but I don't know how they work as I've only used up to iOS 9). Android is really about customizing how you view and access your information, while iOS presents you with a general \"best case\" use scenario as determined by Apple.\nSoftware updates are the other big difference. Unless you pick up a Nexus or Pixel phone from Google, you'll be at the mercy of your manufacturer for the frequency and timeliness of software updates. This means that more than likely you will not be running the most recent version of Android. In contrast, all iPhones get updates straight from Apple, so there's no mystery as to when you'll get it.

My thinking is that if I'm going to pay Apple-esque prices, then I expect Apple-esque support (including being supported for more than 2 years OS/3 years security updates). So the Pixel is going to have to wow me at this point. All the other Android flagships leave me uninterested either due to hardware or support issues (lengthy OS updates).\nSo I've lately been considering my options to stay with Android and not jump to iOS. And the $400 phones have caught my attention. I pretty much like what I see of the OP3, but wish it were sold in local retail stores like BestBuy, etc. And with the personnel loss (developers), now Oxygen and Hydrogen are merging. I'm not sure what that means down the road. I know OnePlus has announced that Nougat will come to the OP3 this year... so here's hoping that works out. I assume OS updates are simple, OTA updates?\nI also like the Moto Z Play. But it won't be released unlocked in the USA until 10/20. And Motorola has had some massive layoffs very recently... which make me wonder about the viability of their products too. Also, Moto hasn't had a stellar history of keeping their promise about updating their older phones.\nThe Xiaomi MI5+ sounds very interesting. But I have no idea if it will be sold in the USA.\nThe ZTE Axon7 sounds very interesting too... but I've read it has some sort of connectivity issues. And probably a funky UI which doesn't excite me either.\nSigh. So many phones. So many compromises. But right now I have to say I consider the OP3 #1 and the Moto Z Play #2 on my short list of $400 Android 2016 phones for consideration.\nI want a decent camera that responds quickly when I need it, timely OS and security updates, no lag, decent battery life, and a good screen I can actually see outdoors in bright light. I'd love water resistance too, but have survived without it thus far. I would love a removable battery and an IR blaster, but I think only LG offers that now... and their history of boot loops across multiple devices deters me... not to mention the same problem as Samsung in regards to timely OS and security updates... although I hear Samsung is doing well putting out monthly security updates.

But let's be honest, they cheaped out and got the 1080p display...why not just admit it? Especially when the mxpe came out last year at the same price as the op3 this year, and had QHD. Personally, I don't even think it is a big deal, but why is the CEO defending it saying that the cost difference between 1080p and QHD isn't much...then if it isn't much...then go with QHD, or admit that you cheaped out on the display. \nWith regards to sRGB accuracy, not really a big deal, Carl is right that it is a niche requirement...but the review that he is complaining about is also coming from a niche website (one in which people are really looking for extreme technical data). The average Joe isn't going to go to that specific website to read the review...it is a bit too technical for the common user. https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/com...review/d4hrn6c\nHere is Carl's comment in it's entirety:\n\"I'm sick and tired of sentiment like this. It may not seem so, but for a product company -- it's insulting.It started with the OnePlus One, people trying to find explanations and faults that could have led to its reasonable price. People were complaining about screen variance (visible and common for LCDs, search for \"iPhone yellow blue screen\" images), vibration motor, and cheaper NAND, etc. Looking for any explanation, and quick to jump on bandwagons and to conclusions.With our relationships in the supply chain, we know the BOM (bill of materials) of all other flagships. Out of all the devices that the OnePlus 3 gets compared to, it is one of, if not the most expensive to make. Do you think the price delta between a 2K AMOLED and a 1080p AMOLED is huge? It's a product decision, and spec by spec is not how to judge a product. The OnePlus 3 uses latest generation AMOLED made to our specifications by Samsung. The vast majority of our users, and reviewers love Optic AMOLED. It is NOT tuned to sRGB, and was never meant to be. sRGB tuning is a niche requirement and is not the right choice for the vast majority of smartphone users. Why do you think it's hidden under developer settings on the 6P? For those who need it, we've taken note, and have added it to the next OTA.On the other hand, I get it. People simplify and use mental shortcuts to make sense of the world around them. Price = quality. We probably haven't done good enough of a job explaining our model, and we need to work on this going forward. I understand that sometimes, when our products don't have the highest absolute specs, it might look like corners are cut. This happens when people don't understand the product reasoning that went behind a choice. When we see this, we'll be increasingly vigilant about educating people. Over time, we hope that more people can understand our product philosophy of placing experience above specs. Product management is an art and not throwing together the highest specs. If that's what you're looking for, OnePlus is the wrong brand for you. This is also why I'm not the least worried about new device x or y that may have better specs, because I know it will not fare as well as the OnePlus 3 on the most important spec of them all: NPS.Before finishing this rant, I want to make things really clear. There are no corners cut on the product, and there will never be. OnePlus cuts corners on business model (direct to consumer), org structure (nimble and fast team), and marketing (organic word of mouth focused).Edit Jun 22: Rant was directed at the above comment regarding getting \"panels on discount\".\"", "time": "06-23-2016 09:59 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5238281", "text": "This part is totally nonsense.

I think it's a good strategy and it'll pay off, but the flip side is you're going to get every decision you make 2nd and 3rd guessed online by passionate consumers.\nOn one hand, I'm sure that a QHD screen isn't that much more expensive than a 1080p, but on a $400 device, where you maybe make 10% of that back, every $1 you spend reduces your profit by 2.5%. A lower-res pentile screen might be a bit cheaper, but it also drains the battery less, which makes the 3000mAH battery they chose work better. That, in turn, allows for a thinner, smaller phone, which ultimately has lower material costs, particularly when you've got to mill your case out of a block of aluminum.\nMore importantly, people understandably care about how their display looks - it's the part of a phone you notice more than anything else when using it, in fact - and we've been trained for years to care about size, resolution (and therefore, PPI), brightness, and color accuracy. Very little attention has been paid to size, and while some reviews have said \"it's not the brightest display in the world,\" none have really been critical and people online haven't said much.\nSome people have talked about resolution, but a lot of attention was paid to AnandTech's review, which had phrases like \"most inaccurate display on the chart.\" That is a valid concern, because you want colors to look correct. You want to know when you take a photo, put a filter on it and post it on Instagram, that your friends will see the colors you saw.

It was more than interesting that Samsung reportedly stopped development on the 810 after testing found the processor wanting, and simply not as good as it's in house Exynos, but that they went back to the 820 with the S7. I own both the S7E and the OP 3 and both phones sail - the 820 is more than just a step up in performance it's a much better package and lends to a much better user experience just on it's own. \nI also have to disagree some with your blanket statement that the Nexus QC is better than Dash. Dash is extremely fast and what it does do is take the management off the phone. I did not have a Nexus as I said but I did have the BlackBerry Priv running QC 2.0. Plugged into a QC 2.0 certified charger the phone would often get extremely hot especially if it was in the car running GMaps and PocketCasts at the same time, while charging The phone would obviously throttle at times and get to the point where it would just lock up, especially if a call came in in the midst of it. Removing that thermal challenge is going to be a benefit to the phone without a doubt. We will probably agree to disagree on this one.\nThe N5x wins audio because it has a front facing speaker that many describe as \"tinny\" (see the review captioned above). The bottom facing speaker on the OP3 is actually fairly good for a bottom facing speaker. Let me quickly add as well to watch the pocket now review and their comments about the headphone jack on the OP3.\nFinally I know you think this is subjective, but eventually dark mode will find it's way back into stock Android. The OP3 has it in it's software. I also like the notifications toggle. Also subjective. \nAs I said earlier I think the OP3 is a package that works better than the sum of it's parts, I feel (again based on anecdotal evidence) that the N5x might be a package that does not live up to the sum of it's parts.

The Note 7 was on that list I would have bought one if they had not been out of stock in my area. Instead I used the display ones at best buy, samsung, and T-mobile. The Samsung was the unlocked non carrier bloatware version. Best buy was verizon demo, and the T-mobile was t-mobile demo. All 3 were the same. As time has shown me (I've had 4 samsung devices- all flashships), Samsung still cannot get a fluid fast and smooth experience on Android.\nIt often glitches on Flipboard, and the UI. Sure it's speedy and yes it's fast but it annoys me having to spend $700 on a S phone or $900+ on a Note 7 and have to deal with the lag/glitches/weird hiccups. The OnePlus 3 on the other hand is so much smoother.\nBrowsing sites like Android Central is laggy on the Note 7, almost as if the poor phone can't keep up with the usage and all the features that come with it.\nOP Buy a OnePlus 3. Yes it's not as good as the Note 7 on paper, but for everyday use there's really not much a difference. I've had the Note 3 and Note 4, both were purchased to make my job easier which made it worth it, kind of.\nAlso it's built a little better than a Note 7.

I have a pre-order on the Axon, but I'm really doubting myself on it. My biggest thing against the OP3 is lack of microSD.

For example: setting a wallpaper or lock screen cannot be done from the gallery, it must be done from the Settings-> Wallpaper/Lockscreen. If you go through the gallery, it goes to crop but doesn't change the lock screen or wallpaper.\nAlso no camera short cut and the way to launch the camera from a locked screen is sluggish and slow.\nThe fact the Axon 7 doesn't have back lit dedicated touch buttons really bugs me. At night or in the dark, it's almost impossible to tell where the back button is, and where the home button is. The fact they're so close to each other means I often press home when I meant to go back. This is specially annoying in games.\nCamera post processing is better on the OnePlus 3. The Op3 has a more snap it and forget it camera than the Axon 7. It took 2-3 redos on the Axon 7 to get the right shot. The Axon 7 if you tinker with it has a better chance to take better pictures.\nAs far as performance goes, both are pretty much neck and neck. No stutters or lag with either phone. Both work well for multitasking and are excellent for gaming. So far the 6gb of ram on the OP3 may have shown an advantage one in the entire time, and who really knows if it was an advantage.\nFingerprint sensors both work very quickly, and unlock the phones quick. The Op3 is just a hair tad bit faster and more reliable for me, however that is not an issue of the sensor but me not being used to a rear mounted fingerprint sensor.\nBattery life... this is honestly the hardest part for me to judge because I changed my usage pattern. It seems the Axon 7 and the Op3 may have comparable battery life. If anything the Axon 7 may have a small advantage. I will have more info in the coming days.\nI would make a point to pick which one is more aesthetically pleasing. Weigh in the camera /os vs speakers and display and make your decision. For me the OnePlus 3 won due to the soft gold touch, better build quality (buttons are solid an don't wobble like the Axon 7's) backlit buttons and physical home touch button, and better snap and go camera.\nIt was very close and quite frankly I think I'd be happy with either phone.

The feel of the metal is pretty much exactly the same. It's a great feel, if only a little slippery. It's definitely lighter than the 6p, but has the right amount of heft for its size. \nOne note as I'm typing this, due to its thinness and tapered back that makes the sides of the phone thinner, it is a bit harder to hold onto while typing. (Just put on the thin case I ordered with it and it helps a bit) That being said, the phone feels great in hand. It's a lot more comfortable to hold than the 6p. \nThe software is smooth as silk. As expected, especially right out the box. I've loaded up all my usual apps and logged into everything, but obviously not as many things taking up space yet, so I'll hold complete judgement on that. \nIt does have a few more tweaks over stock Android, which is definitely nice. Can't go wrong with more options like gestures from screen off, swipe down on home screen for notifications, etc. \nNow the screen....\nTo me, it's great. I'm not a screen expert, but it looks damn good. Don't worry about it being ONLY fhd. I personally think it tops the 6p in every way except for when you're looking for pixels an inch away from your face... Well duh! \nBattery life and camera will have to update later. Positive so far. Photos look to be at LEAST on par with the 6p. Which is good, because I've had a great experience with that camera, both front and rear. \nOne of my favorites so far...THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER IS SO FREAKING QUICK!!! It's literally instantaneous. Which means yes, it is quicker than the 6p. MUCH quicker. And very accurate so far. I personally don't mind having it on the front or rear of phone. Both positions work fine for me, so that's personal preference. \nOne of my least favorites so far (knit picking here)...ram management. Yes it is true, they did compromise keeping more apps in memory for battery optimization. But so far it's only been noticeable if I tried pushing it. Compared to the 6p, they both keep chugging along just fine through normal use. \nSpeaker quality goes to the 6p, without a doubt. It's simply a more pleasing experience listening to the front facing speakers than just one bottom facing speaker on the op3. \nThat being said, that one speaker is still very good. \nThis phone, like I said in my first post, has given me the same great feeling as I have for the 6p. It's a whole package. It does everything it's set out to do and does it well. The 6p is still a top contender, but to me, so is the op3. There aren't as many shortcomings this time around. \nI'll update this when I think of more stuff, and feel free to ask any questions if anyone is trying to decide still.

The 5x just has too much lag and stutters too much with basic things - things that my Nexus 5 (and even my Nexus 4) didn't seem to have problems with. The 6p is obviously a better performer than the 5x, but it's too big for me to want to keep. The OP3 may be too big as well, but here's how I decided that a non-Nexus would be OK for me:Performance: The 5x just doens't perform well. The 6p is better, but the 810 isn't exactly new at this point, and it still has some serious thermal throttling issues. This is my overarching concern.Screen: According to AnandTech, the 5x has a more accurate screen than the 6p, and the OP3 is considerably worse; however, when I see a photo on a friend's iPhone, I don't really care that the screen is much lower resolution. Color balance might tip it for me, though (though there, the 6p is better than the OP3 but not perfect.)Build quality: 5x has essentially no real build quality other than 'it's plastic and doesn't fall apart.' By all reports, the 6p and OP3 both are well-made blocks of aluminum and glass.Camera: The 5x/6p might have a technically better camera, but both are pretty good and will take pretty decent low-light photos. I've got a real camera with interchangable lenses if I really care about minute quality differences.OS/Updates: I've only used stock Android on a Nexus for the past 5 years, but OP3 keeps it pretty close. OnePlus has been making the right noises about updates, but I don't know if they'll follow through, but what features are really on Android N that you're super excited about? Multiwindow is nice, but then you're going to be limited by the 6p's 810 and 3GB of RAM somewhat; I personally don't care about VR. Google has spent years ripping features out of the OS and putting them into apps that get updated via the Play Store - things like the Now launcher - and I really suspect that as much as a part of the nerd in me wants to be on Android N first, I won't really miss it for a few months.", "time": "06-22-2016 12:11 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5235354", "text": "The 5X software should have been corrected with updates a couple months ago - mine never had the issues, but I've only had it since April I think.

Build quality I'd agree OP3 is most likely much better than the 5X. The OP3 isn't going to be a notably worse experience on these sorts of things, any of the differences are not going to be obvious to most users. What may be noticable is the proprietary charging thing that OP3 did instead of following the USB - C spec with PD - only the OP3 cables/block will work for fast charging and this makes it only slightly better than the HTC 10 on that front.

The One Plus 3 has a MUCH MORE premium feel to it than the 6P and the odd thing about it is I really can't pin point explicitly why. The metal feels more premium. I think that has to do with the cheap paint job they did with the 6P on my brother's graphite model but it feels rough while the One Plus 3 feels smooth and expensive. The 6p also has flat sharp edges while the One plus has a curved glass front which makes it look more expensive also. The One plus 3 feels as if its more tightly screwed together. It reminds me heavily of the iphone 6s build. \nOn to the display. This is the part that surprised me the most. I thought I was in for a disappointing downgrade due to 1080p but to my pleasant surprise, the One Plus 3 screen just seems to 'pop' more. I think it has to do with the fact that there is a gap between the display and the glass on the 6P while it appears the One Plus 3's display is laminated to the glass. I'm not sure if this is the case but it APPEARS that way. That along with how the glass curves around the edges gives a 'floaty' appearance to the display that makes it 'pop' compared to the 6P. The 6P's display just looks flat in comparison. Also, the 6P's yellow tint is woefully apparent next to the One Plus 3. VERY small text did appear just ever so slightly sharper on the 6P. I did a max brightness test with adaptive brightness off for both devices and the One Plus appears to have a marginal lead in max brightness. \nPerformance wise I really can't notice the difference between the two unless I did trivial side by side speed tests in which case the One Plus 3 did beat out the 6P. Almost every app launched quicker but not in a way that really matters.

Some of you may know me from my OnePlus 3 Peer Reviews! I hope you liked them if you did read them . Recently I ordered an Orzly FlexiCase and I approached Orzly asking if they would be willing to give me some more accessories for review for you guys! Recently, a package of OnePlus 3 cases, screen protectors etc arrived and here I am to give you my truthful review! (For the screen protector, I also have another brand of one from CaseBase to give you guys an even better comparison) Links to all the products will be in the title of the product name! (It will be red anyway.. All links are to Amazon. Replace the prefix with your countries amazon site.. ie change .co.uk to .com)\n1. Tempered Glass Screen Protector\nWell, let me start by saying this.. I hate plastic screen protectors. If I have to be honest, this is the first ever tempered glass screen protector I have used, and I am impressed. As you may have seen in my first impressions for my Peer Review, I didn't like the pre-installed screen protector and it wasn't aligned correctly which really bothered me. It also made the screen feel cheap and it collected every single fingerprint.\nThis screen protector however feels exactly like the actual screen of the OnePlus 3 and it has oleophobic coating on it as well, helping stop all the finger prints. This screen protector was the easiest one I ever installed and the instructions on how to install it were very clear and straight forward. Some pictures? Sure!\n(These are some pictures of the packaging and what is included in the package)\nThe glass itself is 2.5d, just like the actual glass on the phone making it a lot more comfortable to use in the hand. It also works perfectly with cases, and I have used the Orzly Grip-Pro case, Flexi-Case and wallet case with the screen protector installed. As you can see in the upcoming image, it looks great!\nAs I said at the start of the review, I also installed a CaseBase screen protector on to my OnePlus 3 before I put on the Orzly protector. First thing I liked about the CaseBase protector, they provide you with two of them, which I think is a very good idea. However, the presentation is in no way as good as the Orzly One. They put the cleaning clothes, tempered glass etc all in one packet where as the Orzly glass had everything in its own separate compartments which in my opinion shows that everything was thought through. The actual CaseBase glass is just as good as the Orzly Screen protector. It is also 2.5d, however I found that it didn't go around the edges as much as the Orzly one did. It also was a small bit more of a fingerprint magnet, but it still worked ok, it just wasn't my preference. \n(Here are some pictures of the CaseBase screen protector)\n(In that packaging for the screen protector, there are two Tempered Glass screens)\n2.Orzly Grip-Pro Case\nThis case has to be one of the best cases I have used to date. It does as the name suggests, it is really grippy. The back of the case has these type of ridges that just stick to your hand. I had my hand nearly vertical before it even started to slide. It is a two-part case meaning you have to separate the case to put it on. There is a soft, rubber inner shell to protect the phone and then there is the hard, grippy shell. The case looks like a bulky case, but it doesn't feel it surprisingly. I really am not a fan of bulky cases so when I first saw this case I wasn't very impressed, but now it is my go-to case.. it just doesn't feel bulky. For those of you wondering, yes this case does protect the camera bump. It actually goes over the bump by a couple of MM which means you shouldn't have to worry about your brand new phones camera glass cracking . The front of the case has a really good lip around the device, and if you place it down on any surface (with the exception of sand and rocks) nothing would be able to touch the screen of the device. I have (with a lot of fear and worry) drop tested the OnePlus 3 in the Grip-Pro case to see the durability, and it survived without a scratch. Only once did the hard outer shell of the Grip-Pro case pop off!\nThe buttons are a big part of any case, and yes, the buttons on this case are covered by rubber. However, there are little plus and minus marks etc to indicate where the buttons are and there are diagonal lines on either side of the buttons to indicate where they are, however I would still recommend learning where the buttons are positioned before you use this case.\nThis case comes in a range of colours such as the grey in the pictures, red, pink, blue and silver!\n(Some pictures of the grip case)\nOverall, I really do like this case. The ports are exactly where they should be, its grippy, its not as bulky as I thought, the build is similar if not better to that of an Otterbox case.. what isn't there to love?\n3. Orzly FlexiCase\nIf you may remember from the start of this post, this is the case which I purchased for myself when it was on pre-order meaning I have been using it for around 2 weeks. The quality of this case is what you would expect for a gel TPU case, but what surprised me so much was the fact that the ports were just so exact for a device that I purchased on pre order. You often see stories of people getting pre-ordered accessories for their newly released phones and the ports aren't exact or there is a port hole missing etc.\nI was using this case in pretty rough Irish country side conditions. I went onto the beach during a storm with the case, and my god the amount of scratches it saved me from getting on the back of the OnePlus 3 was amazing. It saved my phone from getting it's screen smashed after falling out of my pants pocket while cycling down a hill. It really is one of the best, cheap TPU cases out there. This case also does protect the camera which is a really good thing!\nThe buttons are again, covered, but they do stick out from the rest of the case making them easy to find when its a dark room etc. These cases also come in a range of colours which are Clear (The one I personally purchased), green, black, pink and purple!\n(Here are some pictures of the FlexiCase)\n4. Orzly Wallet Case\nI personally am not a fan of wallet cases, but I know that some of you OnePlus 3 owners/potential buyers are so lets review one!\nFirstly, let me start off by saying that this case also comes in a range of colours which are Black, Blue and Red. At the moment I have the blue case.\nIt is a leather case, and it feels really good in your hand. There is a magnet strap to open and close the case and an opening for the power button to turn it on/off if the case is still closed. There are also openings for the volume buttons when the case is open.\nThe case is very bulky for my liking, but then again most wallet cases are. On the inside of the case there are two slots for credit cards, money, business cards etc... hence the name wallet case! The case does protect the camera for those of you wondering, which is always a good thing!\n(Here are some pictures of the wallet case)\n5. Orzly Fusion Bumper Case\nI received this case a few days ago, and I must say I am impressed. I've purchased multiple orzly fusion bumper cases for different devices ranging from the Nexus 6p to the Nextbit Robin and now, the OnePlus 3. I can really see the evolution in the quality of the cases. The Nexus 6p was very plasticy with shiny sides. The Robin was a harder plastic with matte sides allowing better grip. The OnePlus 3 is all hard plastic, with rubber on the insides and it definitely is the best one so far. The rubber allows there to be a lot more protection available to the device which is a good sign! The case does add quite a bit of grip. I love the fact that in the four corners of the device are little stands which allow the phone to stay raised on the back, which you are able to see in the pictures I have attached! There is quite a good bit of a lip around the screen which helps keep it off a surface if the phone is face down and if will allow you to protect it from drops a lot better!\nOverall I really love this case. Ports are exact, it's grippy, not bulky and it's cheap for the amount of protection it adds. I 100% recommend this case!\nAnd thats all I have for you guys at the moment! I have to say kudos to Orzly for getting this cases out so soon after the launch of the OnePlus 3, and also thanks to them for allowing me to review them for you guys! I really enjoyed testing them out! Hopefully I have helped you guys who are debating if you should get an accessory or not and maybe even have gotten a few of you to purchase one! I 100% recommend the accessories!!\nIf you have any questions please feel free to PM me or comment below! \nDarragh", "time": "08-11-2016 01:29 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5323646", "text": "I'm using the purple Orzly Flexicase and I love it.", "time": "08-13-2016 08:41 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5329851", "text": "Awesome!

I held them back-to-back, nothing happened, tried it at least 10 times, also tried it side-by-side, nothing. I was able to get my apps through a back up I had with Google. Any suggestions?\nI was unable to get my phone contacts through Google, and can't figure out why, since the apps came through fine. I was hoping I'd be able to use NFC and get them that way, but no luck.\nI set up the fingerprint scanner, but can't seem to get it to work, have to use a pin to unlock. What's up with that?\nMy last \"difficulty\" is that the OP3 uses a nano SIM card, my old one has a slightly larger one. Consumer Cellular supplies the for free, should be here in 3-5 days. My question is: Is it possible that I wasn't able to get my phone contacts because there is no SIM card in my phone yet?\nI still feel if the NFC would work, I'd get my phone contacts!\nOther than these minor glitches, I love the phone! It's not too big (I'm a little old lady) and it's really thin. Colors are great, the camera works great, it's easy to customize so far. \nHopefully, someone can give me some assistance.

Hopefully we can get everything resolved quickly! \nHave you tried moving the phones around when you have them back to back? Sometimes the NFC modules are in different locations on each phone. Otherwise, if they were both on, and all other variables accounted for, there may be a defect in either device. \nAs far as contacts not syncing, make sure they are backed up with Google on the galaxy device, then make sure that sync is turned on for contacts in the settings for the one plus.\nThe fingerprint unlock not working is kind of odd. Haven't heard of issues of it not working after setting it up. Nor have I had issues. \nAs for the no sim being the reason you can't get your contacts, that would really only be possible if you had your contacts backed up with your sim only, and not Google.

I like the button placement.\nNear stock interface with customizations I always wanted in stock( I love dark mode!)\nScreen - I think its a fantastic screen, never cared that it wasn't 2k. I have a S7 and Nexus 6P as well. This stands up to them quite well. S7 is definitely brighter however.\nSpeed - incredibly fluid, running lots of apps, exchange, syncplicity, evernote, gmail.\nBattery - I am happy with little over 4hr of SOT with my usage pattern with decent cell signal. \nCamera is overall quite respectable. Not quite as good as the S7, but close enough for me. \nI love the button options and doubletap to wake(Missed that from the LG G4!)Negatives\nBody is too slippery to have without a case.( I use the stock OP3 and Tudia TPU case)\nReboots to happen still once in a while even with the latest update with nav/maps being used at times when plugged in.\nCamera dynamic range could be better.\nAlert slider needs to be integrated with native alert profiles. \nNative launcher needs to have a higher icon density option. \nNeeds more color options for accent colors(nitpicking here but I hate the color options)\nI have some occasional odd behavior when leaving wifi after an extended period and data will not be enabled(no LTE or H, but full bars).

I tried searching for a list of mainstream apps that use this, but couldn't find one. But the fact that this is a Google article and it recommends using Normal priority for email, and High priority for apps like instant messaging - Maybe we should not to expect Gmail to be delivered immediately (if Google followed their own advice)? This article  explains how the Doze maintenance windows (where apps are allowed to check for new messages) get less and less frequent over time, and could explain why people who are trying to check for messages on a regular interval are seeing \"inconsistent results\".\nAnyway - I'll look forward to more feedback and I'll do my own testing when I get my new device.

As Martonik said yesterday, there is a very serious point to considering whether or not the flagships are better enough to warrant an extra $300. As you know, I'm not really a fan of Samsung to understate it and I've always thought that $700+ on a device is a little ridiculous - but I'd also concede the point that they and Apple are the only ones raking in the cash in this industry. For me, I would have a hard time justifying $300 more than a $400 device to get a better screen and a bunch of other stuff that's either so close as to not make much of a difference or stuff that's not high on my list of priorities. If the S7E and the OP3 existed in a vacuum at current prices... it'd be a very tough call for me. I like the software on the OP3 more, I like what Samsung's doing recently for updates, obviously Samsung's screen is better, neither one of them are my cup of tea for how they laid out the devices and they're both firing on all cylinders on making a quality built device, though I'd prefer metal over glass for the build materials. \nMost of the people who have used the device say that the screen looks great and in some cases they're saying it's better than some others that I know to have fantastic displays. That means there is a solid chance that I could get over the differences and prefer the OP3 to the S7E. \nAlso looking for a followup display analysis with sRGB mode on the OP3 to see if it's well calibrated to that color gamut. That could change the OP3's ranking a lot.\nThe front page of this review says a very important point: \"Overall, the OnePlus 3 is best described as driven by pragmatic choices.\" That's a hard bullet to swallow with the current level of competition at the flagship level. But I supported Moto when they made a very pragmatic device in the Moto X 2013. I wouldn't have been able to say in all seriousness that it's the best at everything from 2013 - obviously that'd be false - but IMO it was the best overall package due to the high level of execution and how intelligent some of those choices were. That's obviously the card that OP is playing - and when thinking about it in that vein... it's hard to argue against that strategy other than the \"never settle\" advertising, which I railed against some days ago and don't need to go through again.

I nicely pointed out that I was pretty sure based on the phones specs it should work. I explained the IMEI issue and how I knew they might not want to do that, but they did. In the software on their iPads they were able to see the old IMEI and applied that to the device on their side. After a reboot it came right up using the correct APN (nextgen) and switched to LTE within a minute.\nIn hindsight I believe the APN was likely the issue initially. If when I had swapped the old sim in I had known to check and setup the APN I probably could have saved a lot of hassle. Now I know better for next time.\nI can confirm that the 1+3 doesn't support VoLTE, at least not here.

It feels way faster than the 15W charging I had with my Nexus.

I've read all the reviews but I still can't get a sense of how good battery life is going to be, A.Martonik was talking about SOT with \"heavy\", \"medium\" use but that could be different from me (my friend). \nMy friend and I are both ultra heavy users in terms of battery life.

A typical day of \u201cultra heavy\u201d usage would consist of something like 6 hours of youtube streaming and 2 hours of light gaming.

I find web browsing WiFi tests and video playback tests at a constant brightness/constant reload cycle are a good indicator of battery life as long as the testing body does not \u201ccheat\u201d, eg allow the phone\u2019s display to power off during testing to prolong the battery.

It had a weaker screen and processor than some competitors, didn't have boom sound, was my first phone without a removable battery - it was, on paper, not the best. But it brought a \"work smarter, not harder\" mentality to the industry that had frankly been missing from everything but the nexus line, which was doing a horrible job of selling that philosophy and wasn't available on Verizon anyways, so moot point. The X 2013 wasn't cheaper at first, it price dropped later - the X 2014 and MXPE both were cheaper than other flagships by no small amount. \nThis year the OP3 makes a STRONG argument that paying $700 or more for a phone isn't necessary when you get get damn near the same level of performance out of something that's $500 or less - or in this case, $399. Does it have the same level of polish on every front as the S7 E? No, but who cares? I really don't like Samsung anyways. Realistically, I wasn't going to buy the S7 E - because despite it having top end everything inside it, and this being the first year where execution on experience is up there with some of the competition - it's still just not me and the devices I like have never been top of the line everything - they've always been more focused. \nThe OnePlus 3 makes far fewer compromises than the Moto X 2013 did and does it at a lower price tag. \nGSMArena said in their review, \"Overall, the OnePlus 3 is best described by pragmatic choices\". I don't know if they said the same thing about Moto 3 years ago, they probably didn't because most reviewers hated it without ever trying to understand some of the choices (like the X8 computing system rather than the full S600 that almost every blog mislabled as an S4) - but they easily could have said that. Moto did some things that were intentional and they knew they were going to get criticism on some of those choices but they pushed on anyways because some of those choices were the right thing to do. 720P on a 4.7\" device was the right call - using a terribad display was not. For OP3 using a 1080P on a 5.5\" device isn't that controversial, it's probably the right call for the right reasons - but it's using a BAD display that's not ok. Word on the street is they're trying to fix that, so we'll see. Either way, both companies trying to push back on the industry being overall too ... shiny obsessed and making some very smart choices along those lines with some stumbling blocks along the way. \nIs the OP3 the new Moto X? I'm not sure, but that's the closest I can get to it right now - although I will say this. If they learn from the two biggest stumbling blocks of this year (Dash Charge and Diamond Pentile display calibrated poorly), the rest of what they're doing already looks good and their on a track to have a similar undying fanbase that Moto started garnering over the last few years. \nDon't try to sell me some nonsense about it being better at this and that than what Samsung does - let it stand for what it's doing right. Work smarter, not harder. If we miss that point, we're doing the OP3 a disservice. \nOnePlus - if you sell out to Lenovo, I'm coming for you.

It also happens to be a really affordable phone. Those two things were certainly true of the first Moto X models (and even the 2015, you could say), but the OnePlus 3 has a much different goal and achieves its \"great\" status in a different way.\nThe Moto X series aimed at doing more with less hardware, cutting back in some superfluous areas in order to make the overall experience better, and in the end taking a holistically different approach to making a phone than \"throw everything into a 'superphone' and put as many features here as possible\". The end result was a phone that was greater than the sum of its parts, that in many people's eyes was a better experience overall. The Moto X had features that other phones didn't, and it could offer them because it cut back in other areas.\nThe OnePlus 3 does things differently. Aside from the 1080p resolution on the display, you can't really say that it's missing specs that other flagships have ... in fact, it in some areas (RAM, storage, USB-C, etc.) has more specs than what high-end flagship phones have. What the OnePlus 3 doesn't have is some stand-out features or altogether new things that you can't get elsewhere. Where the OnePlus 3 pulls ahead is that it does basic smartphone things really well, and it does them for 25-50% less than the competition. It's a great phone, but it's not category-defining or leading the way in innovations int he smartphone world.\nAs I summarized in my review:\"It isn't going to wow you with oodles of new features or headline-grabbing, never-before-seen experiences \u2014 it's just a downright great smartphone, and that's precisely what most people are looking for.\"\nThat's the difference between the Moto X and the OnePlus 3.

For what it's worth, there is a post in the thread that states the OP ROM team is looking into this issue.\nThread:https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/p...issues.451149/", "time": "06-26-2016 10:26 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5240506", "text": "I talked about LTE issues here:http://forums.androidcentral.com/one...-issues-t.html", "time": "06-26-2016 01:25 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Last Word on Screen and Audio Quality", "thread": [{"postID": "post5239793", "text": "Here is a good discussion on the screen and audio quality.

Is it perfect? No. But it's damn close. There are people who are going to say, oh but the screen isn't 2k or that there is no SD card, etc. But to come out with this kind of phone and design for $399 is amazing. This is one of those rare android phones that is available in the US, that's actually symmetrical without an awkward design. Some phones here have wider chins on the bottom then the top just so that they can add antennas. However One Plus actually made this phone symmetrical which to me is surprising. If you are in hardware engineering, you will know it's not easy to keep function as well as design. A lot of people bemoan the fact that the company didn't add something (such as sd card slot) but you have to realize, maybe the engineers hit a limit on what they can do given their experience and money. This company doesn't have deep pockets like Samsung. So yes, it's easier to complain and say, why didn't they just stick something in the phone, but I bet the engineers had a tough time, even trying to make this phone as good as it is, for a lower price than its competitors. \nI also hope that a lot of people buy this and lot of manufacturers (Samsung, LG, HTC, Apple) get pressured so that they drop their prices even a little bit on their flagships. That's a win for us consumers but also a highly unlikely scenario given how few even know this phone exists. So before you bash this phone, just think about all the other phones in the US relative to their prices, and you can appreciate how much One Plus delivered.

It feels worse than my Nexus 5 did in some cases - this is probably thermal issues which plague the Snapdragon 808. It's almost intolerable. The 5X has a very good camera, but only when using HDR. In all other cases, it's average, and with the processor, HDR takes a while to work through. The screen is good, but not great. I got a 5X not because I wanted a good, cheap phone, but because I wanted stock Android and didn't want a device I couldn't hold with one hand (6p). If Google had introduced a '5p' I'd have gotten it instead. The plastic is... ok but the device looks utterly unremarkable, and feels more like hollow plastic than the 5 did.\nWhat I do like about the 5X: Google's support, wide user base, and first to get updates, decent camera quality, ok size (wish it was a bit thinner, and I still think 5\" is better than 5.2)What I'm realizing now: Google knows it lost the Android upgrade game. None of Google's OEM partners can deliver OS updates in a quick and timely manner, and even if they do, they only do it for a fraction of the time people get a device. There isn't much that I'm excited about in Android N - split screen multitasking, but honestly, the 5X is slow at switching between apps, so what are the chances that it'll be fast at running two apps at once?The appeal of the OnePlus 3: It's almost exactly halfway between the size of a 5x and 6p. Although the 5x is a bit big for my tastes, and the 1+3 is larger still, the 1+3 gives you a 5.5\" screen, and is probably almost the same in the hand as the 5x. The Snapdragon 820, by almost all accounts, makes amends for the sins of the 808/810, and OnePlus is at least making the right noises with understanding customers (and their desire for OS updates).\nCamera is good, maybe a half-step behind the 5x in some situations. I don't take that many photos on my smartphone. If I want a great photo, I bring along my mirrorless camera with it's APS-C sensor that's got like 8x the light capturing area of the 5x. My concerns with the OnePlus 3: Support seems iffy; every year OnePlus changes their story about what they're doing with their OS and updates; the phone might be too big or the weight might be too much.\nI'm not sure if I want to buy and test out or return - but I'm sorely tempted.", "time": "06-16-2016 03:03 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5230887", "text": "I'm on the verge of getting an N5X via Project Fi, so I've been watching N5X discussion closely.
