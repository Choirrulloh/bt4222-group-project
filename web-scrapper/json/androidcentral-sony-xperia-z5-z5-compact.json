I bought a replacement display, but after I installed it I can't get the device to come on. I can charge it and the red charging light comes on, but even after leaving it for a few hours I don't get anything. When it's charging, I do see something inside the phone light up bright white from time to time, but nothing on the display. If I let it charge and then try to power on the device, the screen will go from black to gray, but that's all I get. As far as I can tell I've got everything connected back properly, the only thing I'm not sure of is that part of the bridge over the ZIF connector for the display broke off; are there conductors in that? I'm referring to the black piece over top of the black cable in this picture. A piece in the middle chipped off, but the connector lock still seems to work fine.

Also keep in mind that a smartphone battery won't be pulling that full amount of amperage the entire time it's being charged -- it will use more current early on and as the battery gets charged back up it tapers off. But it's still better to have a higher amp rated power adapter, an older, lessor 1A charger will suffice but it's just going to take longer. If you're using a computer/laptop USB port, it can get more complicated. Older USB 2.x ports will typically be restricted to supplying only 500mA (1/2 an amp), unless it's a dedicated power port where it will be able to supply more. USB 3.0 can supply up to 900mA, but 3.1 and higher versions quite a bit more (5A) so you have to determine the port version.\nStick with a higher quality USB cable, cheaper ones often consist of lower quality and thinner gauge wires.

I have however in the last couple weeks started getting a couple minor problems. I've had to pull and reformat the SD card twice. The first time it appeared to be corrupted and the Media service was smashing the battery life (going flat in 4-5 hours). After the reformat that problem went away. With the battery lasting around 5 days (I don't use it a hell of a lot). This first problem made sense - card gets corrupt (somehow) indexing service chews heaps of power struggling to read it.\nBut then last night the SD card apparently unmounted itself. This time I turned the phone off, pulled the card and checked it in my PC's card reader and it appears fine. No errors, no corrupt files. I tried putting it back in the phone and it won't detect it anymore. It's currently sitting on my desk and the phone is working without the SD card (only had music on it anyway).\nAt the same time as this SD card problem the battery life was smashed again. However, this time the culprit appears to be Cell Standby, it's used 87% battery in roughly 12 hours (the next worst is wifi at 4% then screen and others at 1%). I'm seeing full signal strength, there are no outages logged against the Vodafone network here and I've been sending and receiving the occasional sms with no issues. Should add, I'm at home where I've lived the whole time I've had this phone and never seen problems with Cell Standby chewing power like this before.\nI've also got the usual suspects like always scanning for networks turned off and mobile data turned off. Wifi is on but it's my home network and it's solid.\nSo, any ideas why Cell Standby would suddenly decide to nuke the battery (first time in 3 years) and why it would coincide with the SD card failing to read in the phone (yet still being fine on the PC)? I'm wondering if this is software related or whether the hardware is finally starting to wear out and have problems. Any thoughts on how I could test? Is there any reason why the loss of the SD Card would cause Cell Standby to chew power?\nSidenote: I can easily replace the phone, I'd been holding off waiting to see what the Xperia X was like.

Yes, the current Marshmallow update is out for the Z5. However, depending on your region will depend on if it is OTA or not. But i think most Z5 phones have it by know\n2. Rooting is the same thing as jailbreaking in iOS. It allows you to install custom roms, flash new firmware, install any app you want (even those not approved by google), you have much more control over the hardware, such as you can overclock your processor and many other things. It pretty much unlocks the OS so that you get to have full control of the OS.\n2a. Im not 100% sure about this, i think you can, but the UI on Sony phones is pretty close to stock android as you can get out of all other OEMs. I personally love Sony's implementation of Android and its a pleasure to use.\n3. One great thing about us (previous) windows phone users is that Microsoft provide and fully support their services on both iOS and Android. So setting up a Android device using mainly Microsoft services is actually very easy and (in some cases) it is an even better experience than what you get on windows phone. The outlook email client is great on Android (better than the mail app on WP), the onedrive app also allows for the automatic backup off all your photos to the cloud, MS band works well with Android. You get the full MS Office apps that are just as good as what you find on WP. All these services can be fully integrated on your new Android device.\nHope this helps you out. Enjoy your new Android phone. You will notice a huge difference with WP in terms of apps and the level of customization you can do with Android.

What was your reason to switch? For me it was the small number of apps and the unstable Windows10 system on my Lumia 920.\nI'm not so happy. Neither with android nor with Sony. I don't like the Photos it takes, I don't like the interface and I'm very disappointed with the app ecosystem. There are much more apps, but I think they are more expensive then they are at windows phone and the usability is often worse (I loved MyTube, BaconIt, Nextgen Reader and some more and didn't find equal replacements at the playstore).To answer your questions:\n1) I received Marshmallow and many others did. For me and many other members it runs much more fluid now. If you are able to receive MM is connected to the version of your phone (branding and country).\n2) Rooting Sony devices will wipe your so called DRM Keys. You will lose some functions such as some Kamera Features (which might make photos worse or better), some audio enhancements and very few other things.\n2a) I don't really now. You need something specially made for Z5 because you need the drivers for Kamera etc.\n3) A big yes! Even I don't really like all the E-Mail apps I tested so far (round 10 apps) because I liked the usability of windows stock mail better, I kept the google standard E-Mail app (not gmail, not Inbox). It handels my mails perfectly, even better than my WindowsPhone did. This is even more true for the stock contacts app. You'll lose the Facebook contact pictures, which is a real shame, but you'll win the ability to use contacts groups (if you're using Office 365 or a paid Exchange account).

Are mods and roms between the two models different?\nI'm only asking since I can get the E5803 for $20-$30 cheaper on Amazon and is eligible for Prime shipping, while the E5823 is more expensive and doesn't have Prime shipping.

OF COOOOURSE that's not what happened 'my sony companion' or whatever the hell it's called that pops up when you connect usb says it can't do **** all because my screen is locked. it won't actually let me connect my phone. so i took to google AGAIN. some Xperia tech help guy on a random thread said to try using MyXperia to reset the password, i don't have MyXperia connected on my phone apparently, which needs to be done manually on the phone before i can access it on my laptop... Do you see my problem? hahaha, so then he also said try gmail's android device manager, so that's gone through found my phone etc etc, so it says lock. i click lock 'set new password' so that's what i did thinking i was resetting my password, only to find that the password i just entered is completely obsolete because i can't swipe off the screen to input said password!!! it's just a locked screen (i'm guessing it's the kinda thing you do when you lose your phone so no one gets in...) so what the f*ck was the point of the password if it wont let me use it!?!?!? then it actually let me go back to my original lock screen and enter a password, so i tried the one i put in on device manager thinking YES I'VE CRACKED IT! have i ****! it still says incorrect password!!!!!!!!

This is rather surprising. Obviously nexus 6p is much louder than both.\n3) It is sealed so you add microsd card and sim to slots behind a flap on the side. This is much less annoying than the flaps on the sony z3 compact. Microusb on the bottom no longer needs a flap to cover, although they warn you about not trying to plug in if there is obvious water in or near the port.\n4) I expected it to get hot during initial setup but it does seem to get hot when playing music or installing a few apps from the play store. More than I would have expected.\n5) The fingerprint sensor is nice and well located, but oddly it does not work with lastpass to authenticate, something that even the galaxy note 4 was able to do back in the day. Kind of a bummer\n6) I had no issues getting it setup on tmobile, although it will not have voice calling and I can't verify band 12 support (but this model has it-whether tmobile will support it is unclear). In seattle testing on speedtest got me about 30 megabit download and upload--nice strong signal.\n7) Camera is decent, although it gives you a warning if you try to shoot 4k video it will shut down if it overheats. This is not a warning that gives me confidence about the much maligned snapdragon 810 cpu.\n8) You might need a case just so you don't notice the heat so much.

She currently has the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact, which I got for her Christmas 2014.\nI got her this phone because the only other smaller sized flagship smartphone that was out was the iPhone 6 (and she didn't want the iPhone). Every other top-shelf smartphone was (and still is) huge and unwieldy, and her small hands don't prefer that. So, based on all my research, I got her the Z3 Compact and she loved it.\nThe Z3 Compact's petite and colorful design, great battery life, and solid camera are all likable qualities about the phone. Overall, she likes it but the phone has not been perfect, by any means.\nThe magnetic charging port broke on her after using it for only a few weeks. Constantly having to open and close the flap on the side of the phone to charge it is annoying. And for some reason, the phone's location services and GPS do not work correctly.\nDespite rebooting the phone, the phone was still giving her issues. So, we exchanged her phone for a new Xperia Z3 Compact directly from Sony (covered under the warranty). Yet, the phone's GPS still did not work properly.\nAnd more recently, weird and random things have persistently been occurring. For example, her alarms only vibrate rather than project sound, even though she sets all her alarms on loud. The alarm's vibration still manage to wake up her up on time, but this should not be happening, either way.\nSo now, I want to upgrade her phone but I am not sure exactly what to get her. I want to get her the Xperia Z5 Compact because it's still the smallest flagship smartphone out there. She still doesn't want an iPhone lol.\nThe Z5 Compact seems to have rectified most of the flaws of the Z3 Compact (i.e. micro USB port is no longer covered with a silly flap and the phone remains \"waterproof\"). Nonetheless, I don't want to risk getting her another Xperia phone because it may yet again prove to be a somewhat broken smartphone experience.\nAt this point, I'm not sure what new phone to get her. Other than the Z5 Compact (maybe), there aren't any other smartphones that are as pocketable as the Xperia phones. So now, I'm just looking at other phones that come moderately close. I may consider getting her a Samsung Galaxy S6 (or S6 Edge), but I am also considering getting her the Nexus 5X.\nThe Nexus 5X is a reasonably priced phone that, while not as petite as the Z3 or Z5 Compact, is still fairly manageable to use with small hands. From my research, I've learned that it has a decent battery life (no where near as good as the Xperia phones, but most smartphones in general aren't as good with battery life), a pretty good camera, and quick software updates.\nEven though my girlfriend is not a tech nerd like me and doesn't really care about the stock Android experience (she just wants a phone that simply works), the quick updates may help just in case some issues do arise with the Nexus 5X.\nAs you can see, I've done a lot of thinking and researching about this whole situation. If anybody can give me some input as to what phone I should get her and why, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I'm not actually sure why you even considered this phone if you were so concerned with resolution. You're crying to a group of people who likely chose this phone for its size and power. We know the resolution is not up there with the big boys. The plain fact is we don't care. If your argument is that they should use a 1080p screen then here's some reasons why not:\n1. Higher resolution screens require more processing power to render the images. This will suck up more battery. Smaller phones have less room. \n2. Sony already makes or has a source for a 4.6\" screen with 720p (z3c uses the same screen). Since noone else makes a 4.6\" screen with 1080p chances are they will either have to pay a lot more for it or have to spend more capital on tooling and design work. Its unlikely they sell enough of these to make such a venture worthwhile. But even if they did, its still hard to ignore reason #1. \n3. Higher pixel density tends to drive up cost. Then parts become smaller the manufacturing tolerances become tighter. This generally costs more from everything from the raw materials to the tooling and processes. With the current trend of larger phones going on, there is a lot of availability of parts in those screen sizes (economies of scale), but with limited sales, what you might end up with is a smaller phone with 1080p that costs as much or more as the Z3.

In the welcome screen you will see the different modules available for you including the \"Support Zone\" option. Click on \"Start\" below it.\n3. On the next page Click on \"Start\" under \"Phone Software Update\"\nAt this point if you get an error stating that \"Unable to install update components\" or \"Server is busy\" , then please proceed to step 12\n4. The program will say that there is no phone connected. Click on the option below that reads: \"Repair my phone\" the program will issue you a warning about the content that you will lose during the update\n5. Choose the option to continue.\n6. The program will issue a final message warning you of possible data lost during the update. Click on the checkmark and then on \"Next\".\n7. After that, the program will download the necessary information (5 to 6 minutes) and it will present you with a list of phones.\n8. Choose your phones model from the list then click on \"Next\" then you will see a new section telling you how to connect the phone. (don't connect it yet)\nAt this point the phone must be off and disconnected from the PC.\n9. Connect the cable to the PC not to the phone, then while pressing and holding the indicated button (in the steps on screen an specific button will be shown for you to press on the phone) connect the cable to the phone and keep holding the indicated button until the program says \"the update of your phone has started...\" (in some cases a message of \"Installing drivers\" will appear before the message of \"the update of your phone has started...\" is shown.)\n10. If you failed to follow the steps correctly the phone will turn on and it will request that you \"Proceed with the following steps, slide down the notification bar\", If this happens disconnect the phone from the cable, turn it off and repeat from step 9).\n11. If the phone is connected properly, PC Companion will proceed with the update ( It will tell you to let go of the back key) then wait for the update to finish and follow instructions on screen to disconnect the unit.\nSince doing that, I haven't experienced any issues. HOWEVER, as I've mentioned in my posts above, rebooting the phone to it's original factory settings temporarily fixed the stuttering, and using the mobile companion app as I have above, rebooted the phone as well, so it might be a temp fix. Also, I didn't install all the apps I normally installed, ONLY Facebook and Youtube. So it might also be an app that was causing the issue.

But really, you shouldn't be doing it.*XperiaBlog*points out*that the handset maker is now taking additional measures to discourage the practice, and has updated its website to help customers avoid making a costly mistake while at the pool.\nIn describing what its phones are capable of, Sony says: \"Remember not to use the device underwater.\" To receive an IP68 rating, a phone must be able to withstand liquid under pressure for \"long periods.\" It has to remain leak-proof down to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. Sony's phones can do this -- they've passed the test.\nSony explains: \"The IP rating of your device was achieved in laboratory conditions in standby mode, so you should not use the device underwater, such as taking pictures. It also says: \"Do not use the device to take photos while performing any type of activity underwater, including diving or snorkeling.\"\nIt's important to note that Sony issued these warnings*for the Xperia Z3+, but they now also cover the company's latest flagship:*the Xperia Z5. Because Sony isn't required to operate an Xperia handset while it's being subjected to water and dust tests, the phone maker is reinforcing the fact that its devices were never intended to be subjected to a shallow dive.\nWhat should you do if you own a top-end Xperia? Well, you're clear to use it in \"wet surroundings.\" You can probably use it briefly while underwater, but that's completely on you.

Bought in spite of all the reviews of overheating. Phone was exactly as bad, if not worse, than \"advertised\". It slow-roasted itself to the point the screen stopped accepting input. In the trash. Samsung S6 Active. I believe this is an AT&T only phone and is the reason why I will never ever ever EVER buy another Samsung phone (Just really dislike their version of Android) NOR be an AT&T customer again. Very short story, I just moved overseas and when I put in my AT&T unlock code, the phone bricked itself. AT&T was also VERY slow to provide updates. Only non-carrier fully unlocked phones for me from now on.\nWhich brings me to the Z5. I bought my girlfriend a Z3 last year and it has been rock solid. The best phone she has ever had (She really didn't want to get another Android phone). 0 Android lag after time and the perfect size. I hadn't kept up with Sony phones in the past 4 months so only knew about the issues with the Z3+. Walked in to the Sony store here (not sold anywhere else) and saw the Z5c and after a few questions went ahead and bought it. To me, it is a solid, great looking phone (although I have it in a nice cover) and is the perfect size.\nAs my name implies, I've been a Windows Phone user (had a Lumia 800 and 920 before the 930). Unfortunately, the lack of apps really hinders me using the phone as a tool. Had I been able to get my hands on a 950, I still would have had to make a tough decision..Go with the OS I really like and sacrifice having a fully functioning tool or go with an Android phone. No 950 here so no tough decision :-) \nTell you what, this phone stands a good chance of making me forget about a Windows Phone (at least while Microsoft figures out a solution or strategy to get apps on the platform AND put out a quality high-end phone). So far, it has been perfect and has met or exceeded all expectations. I was skeptical on the fingerprint sensor but it works flawlessly for me. I have all of my Microsoft services so it integrates well with how I use my other devices. Really pleased.\nHere is the bad news for Sony Xperia fans.... just look at the number of threads in this and the other Xperia phone sections.

The screen on the Z5C looks better to me but I guess that's going to vary person by person. The N5X has the better spec'd screen but I prefer the Z5C screen over it. \nSpeed:\nMy N5X lags a little in certain areas. I have not noticed any lag on the Z5C.

As I previously stated, I ditched the Sony launcher in favor of the Google Now launcher. \nFeel in hand:\nOne handed use on the N5X is doable but depending on your hand size may not be possible. The N5X feels fine in hand. I've read many of the so called expert reviews where it's called cheap. I did not get that feeling when holding it. Does it feel 'slip out of your hand premium'? No, but I have no complaints with the feel in hand with the N5X. I am only on day one with the Z5C but for one handed use it rocks! It does feel more premium in hand -v- the N5X but again that is going to vary person by person.\nThe N5X is a fantastic device but it's larger than I wanted.

Can anyone confirm whether this is true?\nI also just dropped it on a rock and there was no serious damage, just a scuff on the frame.\nSony definitely stepped up the build quality on the Z5C, and this is one of the things I'm happiest about with the upgrade.", "time": "11-24-2015 01:32 AM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"title": "My impressions of the Z5C vs Z3C (stuff not generally talked about in reviews)", "thread": [{"postID": "post4834480", "text": "Overall I've been a pretty happy Z3C user. My two main beefs with the Z3C we're some build quality issues (screen on two devices would pop/flex) and I've never been crazy about the photos. They were just ok. \nSo here's my take on the Z5C:\nFirst, the fingerprint sensor changes a lot in terms of how I interact with the device and how quickly I can access the device. I really like it. However, as reported elsewhere the scanner is not always completely reliable if my finger has recently been wet, cold, etc. I'm still exploring how to optimize my fingerprint readings, and it may also be a case that my fingerprints are a bit worn down and so fingerprint scanners in general may not work very well for me (this is the first one I've tried using). But overall it's an excellent addition and I love the location of it on the side. (UPDATE: I think I just made a breakthrough and how to setup the fingerprint scanner to get more consistent/accurate reads. If you're not getting realiable consistency try pressing a little harder during the setup process. This made a major difference for me.)\nSecond, the speed of the 810 processor is phenomenal and makes the phone feel so much quicker. This is something I did not anticipate liking as much as I do, and it has been a real pleasant surprise. If you're a Z3C owner and on the fence about upgrading definitely do not use the Z5C unless you're ready to move up to it as I think you'd have a hard time going back to the relatively slower Z3C.\nThird, the build quality has dramatically improved on the Z5C. It feels much more solid and sturdy; a firmer hold in the hand. Z3C was much more slippery, bigger risk to drop. In addition to the screen pop issues I had, my Z3Cs always had more flex and creaking than I liked. Really glad Sony did away with the second flap/compartment on the Z5C, which I'm sure helped reduce device flex. Z5C's frosted back glass means no more fingerprints on the back, and there seem to be less on the front too. The new SD card/SIM compartment closure feels more solid. Making the USB waterproof was also a great move. I thought I might miss magnetic charging, but I'm not.\nFourth, the audio quality, in terms of both phone call quality and speaker music, is much improved. I can hear people much more clearly on this device than the Z3C. I also play music from the speakers when I jog, and the sound quality is much crisper. I want to also say that using my headphones (aptX Sennheiser Momentum wireless) that sound quality is also slightly improved, perhaps due to a better DAC? I'm not 100% sure about this and was already pretty happy with the Z3C headphone performance.\nFifth, battery life seems to be about the same, which is a relief. I had heard some people were experiencing worse performance, but I have no problems getting through the day with 30 to 40% still left after heavy use.\nSixth, the display seems to be improved. Slightly sharper and more vibrant. I didn't expect this and I'm not quite sure why this is the case because the resolution/spec has not changed much.\nSeventh, the location of the volume button has not been a problem. Some early reviews complained about this, particularly on the bigger model, but I find its placement on the Z5C just fine.\nEight, I'm not a gamer or 4K video shooter, but I have not experienced the phone overheating or getting too hot, which was something that was a concern.\nNinth, I have not experienced any of the software stuttering that the Verge and others have reported. I'm wondering if some of the complaints here were on an earlier firmware.\nTenth, using the screen in the tub when the screen is wet, or with a wet finger, also works a lot better. I think Sony rolled out this improvement in the Z4/Z3+. Much appreciated.\nI have not had a chance to thoroughly test the camera yet or do a side-by-side with the Z3C, and based on what I'm hearing about a camera software upgrade in the works I think I'll reserve judgment here until after that update/Marshmallow rolls out.\nSo overall, well done Sony! \nAnd if they can enhance the camera startup speed (UPDATE: new 2.0 camera software rolled out today dramatically improves launch speed; the UI is also improved) and further improve image quality then all the better. But for me, even without any camera improvements factored in this was a no brainer upgrade from the Z3C.", "time": "11-15-2015 11:56 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4835096", "text": "Thanks for the write up.

Although everything there works fine, I am constantly unhappy or frustrated with the following:\n-\tBoring UI\n-\tiTunes is just the biggest pain in the world\n-\tBattery life is quite poor (currently using an iPhone 5s)\n-\tOnly ok\u2019ish camera\nI am totally against > 5\u201d smartphones, so following Sony\u2019s reputation the Z5C was the natural choice: great camera, great battery life, and an acceptable size.\nImmediately after unpacking and turning on the phone, it started running hot. And I do mean hot, not just warm. Even before I even started loading apps or anything. \nI used it for a whole day, and it was becoming hot even when just writing an email or taking a look at the latest Facebook updates. I hadn\u2019t even placed my Sim card in the Z5C and decided that I just can\u2019t use a phone that gets that hot. I put it back in the box and decided to return it during the following week.\nDue to work I did not have time to immediately return it and every evening I was seeing the box on my desk, tempting me to give it another chance. So I set it up again, and decided to be \u201cstrong\u201d and use it for a few days to really get a better feel of it. I got acquainted to it for a couple of days at home and then had to go on a business trip, so I thought it\u2019s the best way to fully test the device in \u201creal world\u201d situations.\nI tried to go past the fact that the phone turned hot just when I grabbed it to send a couple of Whatsapp messages. But it was getting so hot and making my hands moist, making the fingerprint scanner not recognize my prints anymore. Countless times I had to unlock the phone by entering the code.\nI was also suffering from a few other annoyances, the biggest being that the phone was not able at all to select by itself a roaming network. Despite it being set to \u201cautomatic\u201d, I did have to manually load the list of networks and select one myself. If I would lose the network while going through an area without coverage, then I would have to go back to the list and select manually a network again. I travel abroad quite a lot for work, so this is just unacceptable. This never, ever happened with the iPhone.\nMy Exchange professional account also wouldn\u2019t sync by push on a roaming network, which never happened with my iPhone, so I knew it was an issue with the Z5C.\nOne can criticize how iOS is a locked OS, and I\u2019m one of those people, but on the other hand Android is just too much! What\u2019s the point of having a \u201cgallery\u201d app, and a \u201cphotos\u201d app (or was it album?). Anyway, after taking a photo, or saving a photo that I received by email or Whatsapp, I never knew where to find it again in the phone. Just save all the pictures at the same place for cyring out loud!\nThen let\u2019s talk about the camera. Yeah, sure, it\u2019s got 4 times more megapixels than my iPhone. Unfortunately in no way does it take better pictures. I got a lot of out of focus shots despite shooting a very contrasted landscape for example. Maybe Sony should not aim at having the fastest autofocus ever and rather on having a precise autofocus? Also the colors of the photos that I took were far from being accurate, and the pictures had lots of artifacts in them. \nFinally I\u2019m going to talk about the battery. What does this phone have? About 1000 mAh more than an iPhone 5s? Eventually, I used it less than I use my iPhone, because the overheating issues make it very uncomfortable having the phone in your hands for a long time. And despite this, the phone was running very low on battery at the end of the afternoon, forcing me to use my power pack to recharge it\u2026 exactly like my iPhone.\nTo sum up, I do love the Z5C\u2019s form factor and design, and I really wanted to love using this phone. Unfortunately, the overheating issue was a major show stopper, together with all the other annoyances that I mentioned above. \nNow I have to find a way to get rid of it because the shop where I bought it does not offer refund or even an exchange policy. Right now I\u2019m 600 euros poorer and back on my iPhone 5s\u2026 wondering what to do next as it\u2019s out of the question to buy an iPhone 6 for 749 euros (and don\u2019t even start me on the 6s\u2026.)", "time": "10-14-2015 07:28 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4748700", "text": "Have you contacted Sony about an exchange?", "time": "10-14-2015 08:32 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4748853", "text": "You got a faulty unit (sorry to hear that).
