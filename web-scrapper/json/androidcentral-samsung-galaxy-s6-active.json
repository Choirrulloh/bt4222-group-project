[{"title": "Galaxy S6 Active help. Broken Screen, data recovery, screen connector info", "thread": [{"postID": "post6035976", "text": "Goal: I need a way to unlock the screen or force an adb connection, possibly without a screen. Phone is not rooted. Lock is pattern type.\nBackground: Recently damaged my S6 Active G890A. LCD was cracked, outside glass cracked, was getting no images, pulsing blue light in corner. Took it to get repaired and they said the phone wouldn't boot (tried two screens to make sure). Got it home and decided to fiddle with it some more (sans screen assembly) since I have pictures of my kids that didn't get backed up yet. I can get it to turn on, receive calls (rings only, can't answer obviously), can find it with Samsung/Google find my phone services, charging light comes on from time to time and will wireless charge, etc. Can see it in ADB/Kies from time to time but can't access due locked screen and no RSA.\nQuestions: \nIs it possible to use a screen from a Galaxy S Express (SGH-i437) that I happen to have lying around as a replacement for my S6-Active? Do they have the same number of pins/configuration? I tried to connect it but the cases and short cable make it difficult to get it close enough to see if they work together. I thought I could get a cable extension but I would need to make sure that it fits the phone (G890) and the screen (SGH-i437). \nSecond part of this would be do the G890 and G920 have the same screen connector?\nHopefully that's clear enough to get some answers and make progress.

Previously, the top notification automatically expanded to show the full notification.\n2) Removal of \"Brightness\" control from quick setting pull down menu. Like notifications, it used to be there if you opened the quick settings by swiping down from the top of the screen. Now you have to swipe down, and then open the full settings with a second swipe down. \n3) Settings gear - As other posts have noted, this is a complete change. Instead of a horizontal layout with a few main categories, the layout is now vertical with lots of categories. This is more of a shock difference than inconvenience, as you might be able to get to some sections with less clicks/swipes etc. \n4) Powering off - It used to be that you'd hold the power button, select \"turn off\", and then reconfirm. Now, you have to take those steps plus enter your unlock key (at least I did with a pattern) - unsure if password users have to do the same. (Well, at least the first time I did... now it seems to have gone away).\n5) A bit picky, but some of the new icons are very white... some non-stock apps even got changed from a colored background to White... \n6) Camera Settings - Looks like they took away a couple of modes (if you used anything other than \"auto\". I go to a fair amount of concerts, and the \"Sports\" mode was great for pictures. However, that is now gone...\n7) Camera Controls - The Volume Rocker used to control your zoom in/zoom out. Now it changes you to video mode, leaving the screen/pinch control as the only zoom option I can find. \nI've got no issue with changes due to functional improvements, but making the user take more steps to achieve the same results, and removing previous functionalities and controls is not customer-friendly.

When I first got my phone I searched and searched but real top grain leather cases were not available. I wound up buying two fake leather cases on Amazon for less than $10 (one by Abacus24-7 and the other by Nagebee), they weren't to bad but felt cheaply made and finally wound up settling on one by i-Blason that was $20 that seemed to fit the bill. But yet again it wasn't real leather and although it seemed nice I still had the craving for a nice leather case. So anyways yesterday after doing a search on Ebay I found a handmade one by a seller named \"shop-leather\" out of Israel. Its probably gonna take a couple weeks to ship but judging from the pics it looks like its going to be a winner. I'd post a link to it, but the site won't let me as I haven't posted enough messages on here to post a link yet, so in the meantime I'll try posting a pic and see if that works.....\nUPDATE: Received my case 8/13 and all I can say is I like the heck out of it, a good looking nice soft leather wallet style case for only $39 that will protect the screen when closed and looks sharp when opened, what more could you ask for? Everyone who has seen it loves it also!\nUPDATE 2: The case is already beginning to show signs of wear after only about a months use, it seems to be made out of very thin leather, still a nice case though. I also just noticed HandAndHide on Etsy is now selling a leather wallet style case also and he uses top full grain thick leather like an old cowboy or biker wallet. I bought one of his cases for my HTC a couple years ago and it didnt do nothing but get better with age. I even one day dropped my HTC One about 30ft off the top of the cooling tower at work in the refinery onto the pebble surface below and it survived without a scratch, my guardian angel might have been looking out for e that day though or I was extremely lucky as hell!! I think I might see another one of his cases for my phone it the future depending on how the Ebay one holds up, they aint cheap though, damn near $100 (vs $39 for the Ebay one) but still worth it in my opinion!\nUPDATE 3 - \nFinally received the case from Etsy and all I can say is that its bad to the bone! Thick full grain leather, as a matter of fact the leather is about as thick as the leather on a pair of shoes! It was so thick it was kinda difficult to fold over and snap the case I coated it with mink oil and it made all the difference in the world. I don't use folding leather cases to hold credit cards ect like a wallet, I use them because in my personal view they protect the screen better than any other type case and that's the reason I buy a case anyhow is to protect the screen as its the most fragile breakable part of the phone!", "time": "08-01-2015 11:19 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4587324", "text": "I just bought my active and the guy at att store said there was a case that made it so I could use an SD card, I've found them for s6 but not the active.

Since the Google Fit support pages do not provide me a way to submit a ticket, nor is their online help any help at all, I am asking here. I pondered putting this in the Android Apps forum but hoping this may be better answered here as it may be phone related.\nThe quick story: yesterday, I walked a lot. I went to a local city park, I went to the gym, and then back to the city park. I hit over 15k steps according to my FitBit, and over 16k according to Google Fit. I assume the GF number is the phones internal pedometer and not specific to the app, but I could be wrong on that.\nMy issue: None of my almost 4 hours of walking got detected by Google Fit's auto-activity detection, and I mean none. The only time it thinks I walked yesterday was when I walked my son to his bus stop at 6:40am. I always keep the setting on and I verified it was still on last night.\nI am attaching two screenshots taken after 9pm last night, one of my FitBit app and one of my Google Fit app. You'll see the high step count in the GF screenshot, but the paltry 0.6 miles and only 16 minutes of walking which, going into the timeline, was all done in the morning. I am not worried that the step count doesn't match, they are separate trackers so that's understandable.\nI saw somewhere else on these forums, but couldn't find, where someone said they had to shake their device to get the internal pedometer to start working? Not positive I recall the issue correctly that was being talked about on that thread. But, my question is, is this an internal pedometer or motion sensor issue in my phone, could it be an app issue, or has anyone seen something similar to this?

Since then, I've absolutely loved this device as it offers a ton of features and suited my daily needs. However, there have been some bumps along the road that resulted in repairs by the Samsung Service Center and a warranty exchange by ATT. Here's the rundown:\nOriginal device: Screen cracked after my son bit the edge. No crack visible, but disabled the display. Screen replaced at the repair center\nOriginal device: Water entered device during a visit to a water park. No submersion, but alot of splashing as I was taking pictures. LCD was deemed faulty and replaced at the repair center at no cost.\nOriginal device: Experienced battery drain and heat issues. No physical damage to the device. ATT Warranty replacement.\n2nd device: Water entered device after being submerged in 2 feet of water for approximately 3 minutes. Device shows no signs of physical damage and SIM card tray was inserted properly at the time of submersion. (Here is where I am now)\nIn short, I have a warranty replaced device that appears to be water damaged. I'm no phone tech, but I can see condensation inside both front and rear camera lenses and the device does not charge or power on. It is apparent that this particular device was not capable of resisting water for the advertised time and depth. The device must have taken on water like a sinking ship the instant it was submerged. \nPerhaps this warranty replaced device was a screen repair that was not properly sealed? Maybe it wasn't. Maybe it is just one of those S6 Actives that isn't truly IP68 certified as it was marketed as. So here I sit with a dead phone which I am still paying for on ATT Next. Over the next few days, I'll be thinking about how to address my situation and maybe even help those who experience the same problem only to get the \"Water Damage not covered\" thrown in their face.\nAfter seeing Phil's post about the S7 Active and Consumer Reports, I realized that some S7 Active owners are experiencing their devices taking on water. I find it completely unacceptable that these specialty devices, designed to withstand the elements, have issues doing so. \nI'll end this post by saying that I am a consumer and phone enthusiast. If you're reading this, chances are that you take a greater than average level of interest in the Active line as well. Most of us aren't doing the drop/durability/underwater tests with our phones, but we're using them in a manner in which we believe the device is capable of handling. We believe this because the \"IP68\" certified that appears on the marketing material leads us to think that.", "time": "07-14-2016 08:46 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5264808", "text": "", "time": "07-14-2016 08:57 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5265458", "text": "Update: I generated a service repair request on Samsung's website.

We know our Galaxy S6 Active owners are excited about the new Marshmallow update. I am excited about it too, as I wait for it to be released for my device. I understand the wait may be frustrating but we are working diligently to get the update to you.\nWe are putting the 6.0 update and your device through extensive testing to ensure full compatibility. Once we are sure that the Marshmallow update will successfully operate on your phone with no issues, we will release it to you. As of now, I don\u2019t have a firm date for when this will happen. Rest assured, when available, you will receive an over the air notification on your device with step-by-step instructions to update your software.\nFor more updates and discussion about Marshmallow availability, please visit https://forums.att.com/t5/Android/Ma...4817255#M69781\nThank you so much for your patience!\nTim, Community Specialist\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI have been running a beta build since early May and have not run into any issues what so ever.

I too had an incident in which the durability of this device came into question. The damage on mine, was a bit different as my 3 year old bit the corner of the device causing a hairline crack. I didn't even see the crack but i knew it was damaged because the screen no longer turned on. I sent it in to Samsung repair that day and they too quoted me something like $317 to fix it. I flew off the handle (not over the phone) but I couldn't believe how a child could damage a \"rugged\" device sporting the latest gorilla glass. I made my argument to Samsung level 1 and level 2 support, then to the repair center manager, even consumer relations at a point. \nSure, LCD damage isn't covered under warranty, but its not like you took a hammer to the device. Daily drops or other accidents happen more often than not. \nMy advice is to try to work something out with Samsung Support and the repair center. \n1. Keep your cool at all times\n2. Keep notes on when you call and who you talk to, ask for a reference or ticket number \n3. Ask for help on resolving the issue (+$240 isn't an acceptable solution as it is too expensive.)\n4. Don't demand anything or to speak to a manager/supervisor. Level 1 and in some cases Level 2 support don't make decisions about cost or replacements but they can put you in touch with the people who do. Speak to them as you would want to be spoken to, no matter how frustrating it gets.\nThe bottom line is that the S6 Active is advertised as a rugged device capable of keeping up with those who have an active lifestyle. To me this means withstanding exposure to the elements, more bumps, drops, or whatever else that isn't considered abuse. \nAlso, make sure you know what their warranty states before you call. I would also point out the fact that Samsung Protection Plus is offered on every other S6, Note, and S7 flagship device, and inquire as to why its not available on the S6 Active. One would think its the toughest device and wouldn't need protection plus, but that's not the case. Suggest maybe you would have purchased protection plus had it been available for your device. Even if you purchase protection plus at $129 and replace the device under that, you're still paying less than the $240+. \nThe key is to be persistent and polite while dealing with support on the phone. Samsung and the repair center make pretty good money on protection plans and repairs. They can afford to cut people a deal. You just have to try.

I have 2 weeks to decide if I am keeping it. Owning Nexus phones before, it is nice knowing that I will receive Android software updates as soon as Google releases them. I did some non-scientific side by side speed tests. Opening apps cold, it was pretty side by side. There were a few times where the 6P opened an app faster than the Active, but on average apps on the Active opened a little faster. Once more than 3 apps were open, the 6p was faster, not having to re-flow many apps. \nI tried entering directions in Google maps. The Active decided to have a brain fart after I put the address in and it just froze for about 5 seconds before putting the pin on the map. Also once navigating, the 6p had no issues multi-tasking and battery drain was minimal. When navigating on the Active, it was running hot and slowing down other apps. I've noticed this with Google maps on the Active. Waze is a bit better, so I usually use that\nCamera app on Active is much better, in particular the video recording is better. I haven't figured out if the 6p even supports 60FPS. It only has options for HD video and 4K. Processing of HDR pictures is slow. It doesn't seem to cut down on how fast you can take pictures, but it does affect the time that you can review the picture. Picture quality if good, video is a bit shaky on the 6p. I also found that the video is slower to focus, especially at short distances. The rest of the 6p app is bare bones.\nScreen isn't as bright on the 6p at max Brightness vs the Active. I don't think the auto will do the extra boost in the sun, but yesterday was cloudy so I didn't get to try it. If it does, I'll really miss that feature from the Active.\nIts silly, but I already miss the Active key.\nFingerprint reader on the 6p is nice, accurate and quick. I never tried the one on the regular S6, so I can't compare.\nVolume on the 6p works well. Always annoyed at the nanny dialog on the Active when I boost it past 75% volume. Especially annoying when connected to my car's bluetooth. I usually shut my phone down every day because of my job. I know the dialog doesn't come up after the first time while the phone is running.\nNo more dialog boxes that pop up on the lower half of the screen! I don't know why Samsung still uses them, they are so annoying. I am always getting messages about slow speed detected even if the speed is fine. Also messages for when connecting to WiFi, etc. \nMuch fewer nanny messages. I never understood why I have to acknowledge a dialog after selecting airplane mode. I know why I selected Airplane mode, you don't need to warn me and make me press ok to activate it. Same goes for shutting down! If I took the time to hold down the power button, then select power off, that should be enough for you to understand I want to shut down. I don't need another dialog warning me that you are shutting on than then having to press a button. Basically 3 buttons presses to shut down on the Active.\nMuch more free space on the 6p. I think is started with only about 4.5 GB used by the system. The Active was closer to 8GB used out of the box. While I like a number of Samsung's enhancements including the camera app, screen adjustments, options layout, etc, I don't like apps like Uber that I can't uninstall. I would say Samsung's features would be worth about 1GB extra to me.\nIf there was a phone size/screen size/battery size ratio measurement for phones, the Active hits the sweet spot for me. Especially since it really dosen't need a case. The 6p is a bit too big, but I can probably get used to it.\nI miss QC2.0, although the 6p charges fast at home, I don't have a compatible charger for my car (yet). But either way, its more stuff to buy.\nLets see if the Active gets an update in the next couple weeks while I can still return the 6P. It would be nice to compare after the update.", "time": "10-29-2015 07:49 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4785570", "text": "@greetings, thanks for the writeup.\nSo far my Active has been great after my factory reset after the first month of ownership. I agree with your software hangups with Samsung, but the hardware and form factor are just great with the Active. At the moment, my only hangup is with the RAM management. It has now creeped into my head to a point were I don't want to multitask out of my game or video in fear that the app will need to reload and I will lose progress. Normal day to day apps like Feedly, mail, texting are fine as reloads are quick. But if I'm in my game, I really think twice about responding to email or text until I'm at a good stopping point -- pretty annoying in 2015 for a flagship phone.\nHow's battery on the 6p?\nDid you signup for project Fi? Would you consider switching from AT&T?\nThings to consider:\n- Now that I've dropped my Active 3-4 times, I'd probably get a case for the 6p since it probably wouldn't do well in a drop. That'll add bulk to an already big phone.\n- Marshmallow is nice, but there isn't anything I'm craving in that build (unless it fixes RAM management on the S6 Active)\n- I booted my OnePlus One the other day and was just amazed at how awesome the screen is on the Active. If the 6p can't compete, you may be regretting the switch.\n- Will it be a switch for you? will you be selling the s6 Active? If not, you could always just switch back and forth depending on how you feel that day.\n- Battery/charging/wireless charging is important to me, I have invested in QC2.0 accessories and wireless charging pads. It would be hard for me to switch that all out as I have tons of stuff besides my phone that charges using the standard USB cables. You'd have to repurchase spare USB-C cables and chargers.\nAnyway, I'm still pretty satisfied with the S6 Active. But that's Android for you, there will be a new flagship released every 3-4 months to get you itching to switch.", "time": "10-29-2015 08:46 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4785837", "text": "@thetruthkc\nHaven't run the 6p long enough to say that the battery life is good, but I'll let you know. It seemed acceptable yesterday. Nice thing is I tried streaming audio in my car from TuneIn radio, ran navigation on Google maps, and kept the screen on. Despite all that, the charge went up while I had it plugged into a 2.1 Amp USB car charger. The Active would go down while running all that unless I had it plugged into a QC2.0 port. I found the Active usually has good battery life, but there are times where it uses way more battery than it should. I don't expect the 6p will do that. Marshmallow requires apps to report more battery usage info. Plus since it started with very no bloat so I don't have to worry about apps have no control over. Granted I miss a few of those apps (camera).\nI hear there are some thin cases for the 6P, i'm gonna chance it though. I got the Nexus protect plan, so if I beat it up enough I can exchange it.\nMarshmallow is nice so far. Yea, nothing stunningly different, but with Doze, better memory and battery management, it should run a lot better over time. \n6P screen is AMOLED, just not as bright as the Active. Only really noticed it when I had them side by side. Both were way better than my girlfriend's Iphone 6+ \nNot sure about selling the Active. I might while it still gets good value (pre S7). Although I might just give it to a family member that needs a new phone. Being able to switch also sounds good. SIM size is the same, so switching would be easy.\nYea a bit annoying with no QC2.0 or wireless charging. I don't always use wireless charging since it is slow, but I do use it from time to time. New cables are annoying too. I do like how positive a click the USB-C connector makes with the phone. Much more secure that before.\nThe 3-4 month flagship is a bit too much, although no more 810 phones please, next round of flagships should be the 820. Main reason I think about switching back to Apple is getting out of the Android flagship cycle. I actually might switch back with the iPhone 7. It is just nice to only have to get excited once a year . Although at this point the only Android phones I track are the Nexus line and Samsung flagships. Seriously if Samsung could just get off the carrier lock-in boat and start selling direct, I would be very happy. Also they need to work on their memory management. Great hardware, but stupid software decisions are holding me back from being squarely in Samsung's camp. How great would it be if they sold an Active that was unlocked and worked on all carriers? I still see carriers continuing to \"distinguish\" themselves by locking in the more rugged variant exclusives. Its a shame, because everyone should have access to more durable phones if they want them. Now that carrier contracts are basically dead, carrier locked phones should die too.

I've been having issues with my Kenwood DDX9207S head unit where it sometimes doesn't initialize AA properly, is more often than not very laggy, etc. Sometimes it runs smoothly, as I would expect for a phone of this class with these specs, but it's getting pretty frustrating. I've tried clearing Android Auto's data/cache and uninstalling and reinstalling it, but nothing seems to help. I'm not sure if it's an AA issue, phone issue, or possibly the head unit (very doubtful, but the screen sometimes stays stuck on AA after disconnecting the phone). I can sometimes resolve the issue simply by unplugging and replugging the phone in, sometimes I have to kill all app processes, and sometimes I have to flat out reboot the phone.\nEDIT:\nDid some testing last night and this morning during my commute (I sit in a lot of traffic, don't worry) and found a possible culprit: Settings. I looked at the memory usage for apps, and without fail, everything was using very little memory except Settings, which was eating 100-300mbs. Killing the process instantly made AA responsive again, but within 5-10 minutes, I was seeing lag again, and Settings was building up memory usage. I'm going to perform a factory reset on the phone today to see if that alleviates the issue.\nEDIT II:\nAfter factory resetting the phone, I'm not seeing issues, SO FAR, with AA. The settings thing wasn't the right target. I still get high RAM numbers with it regardless, and I see the same thing on my Tab S2, so that's obviously not what was causing the issue. The difference *might* be that I disabled a lot of AT&T bloatware before, and in doing so might have messed something up. I'm leaving everything enabled right now, so we'll see how this goes. I only have one car ride under my belt so far, so it's not a very scientific comparison.\nEDIT III: \nRan into the exact same issues earlier this afternoon. Plugged the phone in, got the \"Accept\" screen on my head unit, and then blank. I looked at my phone and realized that AA didn't actually launch, so I unplugged it and plugged it back in. It launched that time, but the lag was there. I can take up to 10 seconds for AA to register a touch, and Maps freezes up constantly for 10 seconds or so before trying to catch up (it usually doesn't catch all the way up before it freezes again). This makes AA more or less unusable for me. I can't find anyone else out there that has had these issues with AA and this phone, so I'm unsure of what the issue actually is. The only difference between last night and today is that last night I was listening to podcasts through Pocket Casts, and today I used Audible. I'll do a bit more testing with/without Audible to see if that's the culprit; I know AA support is relatively new on Audible (though it was in the beta for a while). Again, I haven't seen anyone complain of poor AA performance while using Audible, so I don't know if that's the issue.

After about 10 minutes at the park while taking some photos, the screen blacked out momentarily and the device reset. About 15 minutes later, a fog and beads of water were visible inside the front facing camera lens. The screen remained non responsive for several hours and improved only after I placed it in a dehumidified basement. The screen functions fine now, however, the physical back button has stopped functioning properly. I have filed a ticket with Samsung customer support.\nMy hope is that this issue can be resolved and my device can be repaired or replaced to perfect working order. I also hope to shed some light on Samsung's advertisement of this device in terms of meeting IP68 standards and Samsung's warranty coverage.\nSamsung.com states:\n\"Dustproof and water-resistant,\u2020 the Galaxy S6 active has a rugged design that\u2019s engineered for outdoor activities. Run in the rain, camp in the desert, dig in your garden\u2014all with your phone by your side.\"\n\u2020This device passed military specification (MIL-STD-810G) testing against a subset of 20 specific environmental conditions, including temperature, dust and sand, shock/vibration, and low pressure/high altitude. Device may not perform as shown in all extreme conditions. Water-resistant and dustproof based on IP68 rating, which tests submersion up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. \nOk, Samsung officially states that this device passed military specification (MIL-STD-810G). For water related testing, I did some further research on what this MIL-STD-810G includes. Test Method 512.5 Immersion: This method determines if a device can withstand being submerged or partially submerged in water, or just splashed a lot, and be able to function after or even during the process. This test will determine if a device warrants an IP rating with a second number as high as a 7. There is one procedure applicable to electronic devices:\nProcedure I (immersion) covers putting any part of the device underwater. The test starts by weighing the device. Then every panel, door or cover that might be opened during use is opened and closed three times each. To test the affects of a temperature differential on the seals, the device can be warmed up to 10 to 27 degrees C above that of the water. Then the device is placed into the water so that its top side is one meter below the surface for 30 minutes. Partial immersion is used in cases where the device is designed to float, but other than the depth, the test is largely the same.Note that the specification does not cover the highest IP rating for liquids \u2013 8, which involves depths of more than one meter and longer durations, and would have to be verified independently of this MIL-STD.\nSince the S6 Active carries an IP68 rating, there should be no doubt that it passes tests for IP67 standards.\nMy argument here is that Samsung is telling us that the device passed military spec testing, and is water-resistant and dustproof based on IP68 rating.\nWhat does IP68 really mean? In short, IP is referred to as ingress protection or international protecting rating. The first digit is for solids, such as dirt, dust and other particles. The second number is for liquids. So, IP68 means - 6 = dust tight 8 = The equipment is suitable for continuous immersion in water under conditions which shall be specified by the manufacturer. Normally, this will mean that the equipment is hermetically sealed. However, with certain types of equipment, it can mean that water can enter but only in such a manner that it produces no harmful effects.\nFor the warranty on the S6 Active, Samsung.com states: \n\"This Limited Warranty does not cover: (a) defects or damage resulting from accident, misuse, abnormal use, abnormal conditions, improper storage, exposure to liquid, moisture, dampness, sand or dirt, neglect, or unusual physical, electrical or electromechanical stress; (b) scratches, dents and cosmetic damage, unless caused by SAMSUNG; (c) defects or damage resulting from excessive force or use of a metallic object when pressing on a touch screen...\"\nSo Samsung is saying, Our product can do this (endure specified liquid conditions based on IP68), but if it malfunctions within IP68 conditions, it is not covered under our warranty.\nI'll be back with an update after contacting Samsung phone support.", "time": "09-08-2015 08:51 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4670342", "text": "FYI, I have 3g microcell problems with the s6 active and when I called tech support they said the only \"known issue\" with the active is the water ingress issue.

Here is what I got back.\"I am sorry to hear that you are having troubles registering the Glass InvisibleShield for the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active. That shield is exclusive only to AT&T because they are the only company that makes that phone. They have recently discontinued making the Glass InvisibleShield for the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active for a few reasons. First, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active has a rugged design that\u2019s engineered for outdoor activities. It can withstand inclement weather conditions and absorbs most impacts. The Glass InvisibleShield is made out of a tempered glass and can not meet those expectations.\nHowever, we do make the HDX InvisibleShield for the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active. The Extreme impact protection makes your screen three times more shatterproof so your phone is in good hands, even if it falls out of your hands. Also, it\u2019s scientifically formulated with smart molecules to heal from scratches and dings over and over.\nWe would be more than happy to register the HDX InvisibleShield on your account. If your InvisibleShield ever shows signs of scratches or wear, we\u2019ll replace it, no questions asked, for the life of your device.\"\nWTF does \"The Glass InvisibleShield is made out of a tempered glass and can not meet those expectations\" mean?\nAlso it looks like they are trying to say the HDX is more shatterproof and they make those now.

I wouldn't say that the device itself is junk because I enjoy the camera quality, battery life and screen quality. However, after experiencing issues with durability and water resistance I can definitely feel his pain. It took a bit of effort to force Samsung into honoring its claims of water resistance and durability.\nI fault the manufacturer, and NOT ATT, for not acknowledging and updating their policy when it comes to durability and water resistance on this specific device. It appears that physical and water damage applies to all of their phones, including the ones that have a \"rugged design\", \"water resistant up to 1m for 30\", and \"meets IP68 military standards\". The S6 Active is marketed as a device that is capable of enduring a bit more physical handling (obviously not abuse) and at the very least, surviving drops into water. Heck, they even included an \"Underwater Mode\" in their camera software that tells you how to take shots underwater. \nIf you've got an issue after this device being dunked into the water, make Samsung stand by their claim. If the screen breaks or cracks due to a small drop, make an argument and don't take no for an answer. No one said the screen is indestructable, but what the heck is a \"rugged\" device supposed to be? \nImagine buying a Jeep and the manufacturer warranty states you'll void it if you go off roading.", "time": "01-04-2016 11:07 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4930664", "text": "Excellent first post TracerAK!

I could make a case for durability, but we've all learned that it contains the same Gorilla Glass as the other devices and still vulnerable as any other device to cracks and shatters. The underwater/IP68 probably isn't a deal breaker for most of us unless we spend most of our time in or around water.\nUp until recently, I considered this a Flagship device meaning that it holds top priority for updates, features and support. However, what we've seen leads me to believe that the Active was meant for a niche crowd that aren't concerned with 1. latest updates or 2. Samsung Pay. It has taken a back seat to the S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, and Note 5. \nWould you make an even trade for any one of those devices to be able to have timely updates and Samsung Pay? Would you take the hit on battery life if you went to an S6 or an Edge? \nI wonder if Samsung would entertain the discussion of trading the Active for one of those devices and signing up for Samsung Pay?", "time": "11-06-2015 02:32 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4809186", "text": "I believe you are not the only one that complain about updates and Samsung pay compatibility.\nFirstly, one should remember why we choose the active at the first place.

Also, I get all the premium feature on s6 only except fingerprint scan, which is traded with water proof on active.\nSecondly, no root is nobody's fault. We can't blame on devs. If we can pull a bounty for at least 5000, I believe someone would help us. Also, what would 5.1.1 give us different than now. Ram management?

I was quoted at $237.00 for a replacement. Although their site clearly states that it is $199.00 for out of warranty/damaged lcd repair for the S6, I only payed $70 for the replacement. Here's what I did:\n1.Take photos of the device, find your receipt, and make notes of what happened when your device stopped working (In other words, get your ducks in a row before you call for support.)\n2. Follow their repair instructions for mailing in the device. Keep track of the package and when it is delivered to the repair center. In my case, they take several days to actually check the device in after receiving it. \n3. You'll get a call back when they've looked at the device and made their assessment. They'll demand payment within a business day or two or they will mail it back to you unrepaired. (The voicemail i received didn't go into the details of their assessment and almost seemed threatening. \"If you don't pay up, we're not going to fix this and we'll send it back to you broken.\")\n4. Here's where I made my case. I purchased this device based on its advertised features of being rugged and waterproof and capable of keeping up with someone who has an active lifestyle. As my pictures indicate, I did not abuse the device or do anything outside of normal operation to compromise its ability to function. I really didn't understand how a minor drop could render the device inoperable especially if there are little to no signs of damage. \nI made my case to Level I and Level II support, and eventually spoke to a manager at the repair center who adjusted the final bill to $70. Be persistent, ask for an explanation and push for a reasonable resolution. Sure, the device would not have stopped working if you didn't drop it, but is it not reasonable to expect this type of device to survive drops?\nI reluctantly paid, but $70 is better than $237. And I'm not sharing this to encourage you to \"get over\" on Samsung. It really is about demanding them to stand by their advertised product and treat it appropriately. No, they didn't advertise the s6 active as drop-proof, however, they market it as being a rugged device that meets IP68 standards (some military battery of tests regarding waterproofing and dust proofing).

Most mention that the cracking started near the physical buttons which appears to be flanked by relatively narrow strips of glass. Do you guys with experience with the phone think that this phone is at least as durable as a regular phone (such as the S6)?

I have the S6 Active and agree that this lack of updates is very frustrating. I even can put up with the slight lag that I have seen on the phone --amazing given the cpu and 3gb of ram! Also, I have and have used package disabler as well \u2013frankly, I can manually disable most of the packages myself, so it was not so great, still I did get it and use it! Not the same as rooting. Less flexible. \n2. In my case, there is another factor. I also had a voice problem with my Galaxy S6 Active: I would call ground phones and they could not hear me \u2013or would state that my voice sounded like I was under water. Replaced the phone and am checking to see if the problem repeats. \n3. However, I am still quite upset that the S5 Active has 5.1.1 and we S6 Acitve owners still do not! It puzzles me \u2013what is AT&T thinking? \n4. While I also noted that press has stated that Active S6 is on the list to get 6.0/Marshmallow, I would not count on that happening before mid-first quarter 2016. It does not help that AT&T makes no mention of this \u2013or provides zero milestones for Galaxy S6 Active owners! ;-( \n5. Frustrated! Between the lack of updates, the locked bootloader (ok, I do like rooting!), and the voice call problems I\u2019ve experienced, I am one problem away from dumping AT&T and switching to Project Fi. Not something I do lightly since I have had AT&T for at least 11 years. \n6. I\u2019ve already secured my Project Fi invite (takes about a week); and if I have any more voice call issues, I will spring for a Nexus 5X, sell my S6 on ebay, and cancel AT&T.\n7. As much as I liked their service, it\u2019s getting problematic. No phone updates for the S6 Active plus strange voice call issues, -- I did not buy the S6 active to have difficulties in calls!

I would say that he is probably completely correct! However, he does not have a real security lock enabled. Swipe is not a security measure. So It can't be compared to password, face recognition, pattern, etc. \nBased on my testing tonight, if you have any real security measure -like pattern or password, etc., even with the active key enabled, When you press the \u201cactive key\u201d while the lock screen is showing, you FIRST will have to enter the password, or pattern, or visual, etc. \nAnyway, that's how it works on my Active -using either pattern or password. I suspect that\u2019s the normal Samsung implementation. \nOddly enough, even with a pattern lock screen set, I have two options showing on my lock screen -use the phone or use the camera. \n-\tWhen I swipe the phone I am \"allowed\" to make an \"emergency phone call\" only. \n-\tWhen I swipe the camera I am allowed to take pictures. \nIn both cases I don't have to enter the password! That makes it more convenient than the active key \u2013if you have a locked screen! For example, my Active key is normally set to camera (quick press) and phone (long press), and if the screen is locked I see that I would have to enter the pattern first to use either! ;-( \nActually, I don\u2019t really have that problem since I have my Gear S watch on my hand --and it is associated with the phone -so the phone is automatically unlocked when in contact with the phone. When I I press the active key for phone or photo I get to those apps normally without issue. \n(In order to test the lock screen, I actually turned off my watch -so the lock screen was simulating most common users conditions).\nIn short, the Active key really does not add much to the lock screen \u2013you still have to do your unlock measure. Try placing apps on the unlock screen \u2013since I see that I can use photo and (emergency) phone when locked \u2013even without unlocking. . .\nHope this helps!

After owning it for the past 2 months I've had a love/hate opinion of them. I do love that I don't mistakenly hit any of the buttons during gaming or from within apps. But there are times (in car dock, on Qi charger, or holding/using with one hand) that it takes quite some force to push the buttons. While on the Qi charger, to press one of the physical front buttons, it will knock it off the charger. The biggest annoyance is when using the phone with one hand it takes a bit of adjustment of the phone to reach and physically push the buttons - mostly for the back button for me, which I use a lot since it is difficult to reach the upper left hand corner for the 'soft back'.\nAnyway, I went in search of a software app to give me software buttons.

Much stronger reception and download speed with the Note 5 along with cell reception being better, not that it was terrible with the Active, but the Note 5 is better. \nThe display.. The Note is clearer and brighter and again the Active wasn't bad in anyway. \nBattery life.. Right now after applying the great tweaks for the Active, I'm getting roughly the same for the Note 5 now, so I can only say if the Active Note does get made and keeps the same size battery it's going to be one killer phone in this regard. The battery management improvement is pretty great. \nNo lag with the Note 5, and I didn't have any with my Active. \nThe camera with the full pro settings and tweaks they did on the Note 5 is much better all around on dry land... \nLarger internal memory.. 64 gigs on the Note 5 vs 32 on the Active. \nFingerprint scanner.. \nLouder speaker...and then the Active is as well but the Note is that much Louder \nS-pen. \nNow the negatives. \nNo waterproofing No dust proofing No Activity buttons The glass back as opposed to the ruggedized case (IMHO) No IR blaster No MHL out on this\nFor myself I prefer holding the Active and carrying the Active. It's just a pure joy to not have to worry about it. The Note 5 naked is a slippery beast. \nThat being said both are really is a fantastic phones and I don't think a person can go wrong with either one. My son is just loving the Active I had and that makes me really happy with giving it to him. When my wife gets ready to upgrade I'll get her one too since she's not a tech head like myself. If they get a Active Note out, I won't hesitate on getting one, but for now I will hang on to this one for a while and just be careful with it. \nThere is always going to be trade offs choosing a smartphone, but in all honesty unless you need the extra storage and S-pen the Active is a awesome phone to own and doesn't cost as much.\nPosted from my Galaxy Note 5", "time": "08-28-2015 10:57 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4646760", "text": "MDM, I read your post over twice and decided to settle on using the last sentence as my guide!

Best screen ever, best camera ever. I've never dropped one of my previous phones (all have had cases). But within a week of owning this one, I dropped it while taking a photo... no damage except for a small scrape on this bad boy. I love that I don't have to have a case on this guy. Water resistance is awesome, My friend had an S5 that he washed under the sink after a 'dirty' meal and water resistance became a 'must have' for me. Battery life has been sufficient for me as it gets me through the day of pretty heavy use with near 5hr SOT and about 30% battery life remaining. Quick charging is awesome for when I just need a quick 'top off'. I find myself using my phone a lot more now that I don't worry about battery life. It is a pleasure just staring at that screen.\nNow, the negatives. I replaced TouchWiz launch from day one and changed the theme to the free material one from the Samsung Theme store, however, CyanogenMod for the OnePlus just gave me sooo much more configurable options. The details from the tweaks are amazing. I miss double-tap to wake and some of the off screen gestures. There's just something about the Samsung OS that just keeps me from loving it. The physical buttons do take some getting used to. \nNow the possible game breaker for me. I noticed that when multi-tasking, unless I am switching between two very recent apps, that the OS recycles my apps much too quickly. They are on the multitasking window, but when I want to launch it, it has to start from the beginning. This is most noticeable on games since they take quite some time to load from scratch. So multitasking on the S6 (I think in all variants) is pretty poor. The worst thing is, with the Active variant, we'll probably be considered the last to get pushed updates since we are limited in population (and only on AT&T). This memory leak is documented across the internet and there may be hope in 5.1.1, but I don't have much faith that the Active will get that for quite some time. Anyone else notice this? I don't have a memory cleaner app, I've downloaded and tried to disable 'bloatware' with package disabler, but really, switching between open apps is much slower on this phone than on my previous phones. \nI love the phone, dislike the software, but wouldn't trade it in for any other flagship or upcoming flagship.", "time": "09-01-2015 04:02 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4654107", "text": "After all the help and advice I received here from you folks, I just ordered a new case, a package of tempered glass screen protectors and a Fast Charge Car cord for...\n...wait for it...\n...a Note 5! \nI spent about an hour at Best Buy yesterday afternoon with the Manager of their Cell Phone Dept and he owned a regular S6 and a new Note 5.

They never actually took my old SIM and it was just in my old phone not being used. Even though the GS4 was off and technically wasn't allowed to use the network, I took the SIM out of my old phone. Maybe the network was tricked into thinking my phone number was on the network twice, and that's why it made a group. I'm sure someone will chime in how little sense this makes.\n2. I put my AT&T sim into my GS6, and finally set up the stupid ATT contact book. I was wondering if for some reason deep down, my phone still was associating itself with my AT&T number, and that's why it saw this new number as being different, so made it a group.

So of my expectations (UI) might be based on that.\nUI Annoyances:\n* When the screen is unlocked (or wasn't locked to begin with) i hate that it requires an extra swipe to get to home-screen. Why oh why, cant they just go straight to home-screen after unlock? I find this really annoying.\n** I've figured out i can pin an app so like in my car, i can pin a music player for quick screen on, adjust, screen off access but then i have no other functions in the car. Basically im suggesting if unlocked, powering on, goes straight to last screen/app without needing to pin it.\n* Similar on lock screen, why can't i swipe a notification to go straight to that app?? What a waste to have that information there and no quick way to jump to it\n* I dislike/hate the waste of space that the wifi connected message takes up, especially since in small light blue, it tells you what your connected too in the quick toggles. I mean that information isn't that useful, but show it twice and waste all that space is just bad UI design.\n* Maybe I've just missed this one, but does the clock have an early dismiss feature before an alarm goes off? If not ill have to install a new clock app.\n* I cant figure out how to configure notification light colors for say GMAIL vs. MESSAGES. It seems like all notifications are blue, except charging/charged...\n* Similarly how can i set a different color for notification from specific people? And on the topic of specific people, i have figured out how to make certain apps priority, but i cant find how to make people? IE: I might want a phone call from a certain person ring during DND timeframe, but not all calls...\nSW/HW Problems:\n* It seems like with smart lock on for GPS, sometimes i wake up in the morning and i still have to put in my pin, that's quite annoying.\n* I get daily app crashes, usually for stuff i don't even use or care about, but its there. Like the preloaded amazon app crashes all the time -- i never use it (I've since disabled it) but really, preloaded apps shouldn't be crashing. BTW, whats a good list of all the preloaded SPAM that's safe to disable?\n* I cant get any 3rd party apps to utilize the notification light. I have a chess program i like, but i never realize its my turn to move (if i miss the sound) because the light never does anything to alert me.\n* I notice often, when i would subjectively not be using it that much, that when its in my pocket the screen feels very warm to hot.\n* Now the worst problem I've noticed though is fairly frequent stutters and slowdowns. Sometimes it takes a few seconds just to show me the home-screen or switch apps.... I haven't figured out what triggers these \"pauses\" it happens a few times a day, but not all the time... i don't know if its the launcher (TW) or the HW or android... but i find it very annoying that such pauses happen on such a modern/new flagship.\nNow in all fairness, the PROS:\n* The screen is amazing (you all know that). (I actually wish it could get dimmer late at night on auto, but ive learned to turn auto off and it gets dim enough for me at night).\n* The battery is FANTASTIC. Now ive turned off all the smart gestures but man am i impressed!!\n* When not stuttering/pausing, its very fluid. (This makes me think its SW stumbles, not HW stumbles causing the issue above).\n* I overall enjoy the experience and would recommend this phone to anyone on ATT, most of my gripes are just UI annoyances, if those were fixed (or options offered) it would be damn close to perfect.\nNOTE: I haven't actually put it under water even though i was at beach for first week of ownership - to many problems reported with USB port - i like the protection it says it offers, but im too nervous to actually purposefully try it.\nThanks all!", "time": "07-24-2015 08:42 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4571207", "text": "Google has one that you can dismiss from the notification shade.Been a while since I used Samsung, but on Vanilla and the G4 if you mark the star at the top of the contact in the contacts app, that will allow them to override the DND settings.Tasker should have a way around that.

Here's my take on a few of your points:\nLockscreen - \nThis is annoying, but I do appreciate the extra swipe, but only if my phone turns on in my pocket accidently... now i'm not pocket dialing or dragging/opening icons all over the place. As for the notifications, you can click on one to highlight, then swipe the blank area and it will jump to that app... ALTHOUGH I get major lag using this method. This is a major gripe for me as it tends to be slower then just swiping to unlock, pulling down notification drawer, and then tapping the notifcation.\nNotification LED - \nIt's been a while since I used it, but you can check out Lightflow for custom/advanced LED control. Test the free version first though - https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...flowlite&hl=en\nClock/Alarm - \nSkip the stock clock app and go with Timely from Google. It's free, has a wonderful UI, and works very well. It also features a sync ability so you can have multiple android devices go off (say if your phone dies/freezes, your tablet can still wake you up). And if you hit snooze/stop on one, it will do it on all devices.\nSmartlock - \nI believe the auto-locking is an android thing... I use Smartlock with my Pebble smartwatch acting as a secure bluetooth device. I recall that if you don't touch your phone for a few hours (4?) it will automatically re-lock your phone for security purposes. Unlock it once in the morning, and it goes back to being lock free...just still have to swipe past lockscreen.\nI really hope they push a solid 5.1.1+ update that clears up the lag.

I have used it as my daily driver for a week. I also have an S6, Nexus 6, Asus Zenfone 2 and iPhone 6+ for comparison. I must say this phone has really grown on me. I am not really in a position to need a rugged device but tried it out after many reviewers just raved about it. Initially I hesitated due to the lack of the fingerprint scanner which I have come to love on my iPhone and S6. iPhone is way more developed in apps that can take advantage of this but it is still a nice feature on the S6. The other issue that cause me to hesitate was that it only came in 32GB. After owning the S4 Google Play edition and one of the update literally rendered the sd card unusable to most apps in their ability to write to and delete from etc, I started to migrate away from SD cards. In fact only my Zenfone 2 can accept a micro SD card and the rest are 64GB, which I feel is the minimum I want. I have successfully moved my music to google play music and my pictures and video to one drive and I also carry a 64GB micro SD card in my Meenova on my keychain if I need to move long videos of my kids etc off my phone. So I felt I could try the 32GB in the Active. The benefits were rugged body and IP68 certification etc. The same camera, internals and performance of the S6 really appealed to me. \nThe first few days I tried to hammer the battery. My best was a 19 hour day with a 5:15 SOT with 33% remaining on the battery before passing out. That was about as much as I could throw at the S6 Active during a work day so it passed that test with flying colors. I like the size, feel and heft of the Active. The screen is probably among the best screens going and the calls are loud and crisp. Since my kids like to get loud as soon as I get on the phone, I love the volume booster while on a call! I did not buy it to take in the water or to throw it around, but it is nice knowing it could most likely survive if I did! \nOverall my experience has been superb! This is a device that in my mind if it had 64GB, would be nearly everything I would want if I designed my own device. Fast charging AND Qi and PMA wireless charging, IR baster for when the kids steal my remote, nice selfie camera which lets you say cheese or show your palm to take the picture!

This method deletes temporarily system files. Are these temporary files incorrectly, they can cause problems and errors. That's why it makes sense to perform a wipe cache partition to delete them on the Samsung Galaxy S6.\nDo not worry it will not erase any personal data etc. We show you how to perform a wipe cache partition on the Samsung Galaxy S6:\nTurn off your Samsung Galaxy S6 completely. Then you have to press the following keys to turn on the phone on again:\nPower On/ Off\nVolume +\nHome button\nIf the Samsung Galaxy S6 vibrates once, release the power on/ off button but keep the other two keys from the key combination pressed until a small menu appears on the screen.\nNow mark the entry \"Wipe cache partition\" with the volume down key. With the power on / off button the entry can be selected selected and the process gets started. This usually takes only a few seconds. Then the previously displayed menu appears again. Now select the first entry with \"Reboot system now\" and run the command again with a press of the power button. Your Samsung Galaxy S6 will now reboot.\nThat's it.

Coming from the g4 with it's leather back which I kept naked I really didn't want to hide the phone again... \nSo...I hadn't really paid much attention to the Active since the other siblings has gotten all the limelight, but seeing it in the store and doing a quick search on the phone showed me the potential this phone has. My salesperson tried to tell me that it was exactly the same as the regular s6 on it's battery size and after showing him and another salesperson the Google results were pretty happy about it. \nEveryone puts so much emphasis on the \"premium build\" thing these days they forget about functionality for day to day usage. I know I am guilty of doing this at times especially as gaga over the g4 leather... And when I had that phone I always had the nagging deep down fear of dropping it or getting grease from work on the leather or getting inundated from water on the job or in the rain. \nIt's kinda weird that I had a sort of a epiphany when I first picked this phone up... that this phone while beautiful on the inside and it's display , was stealthy and rugged on the outside and I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. \nThe battery size in this phone is amazing. The screen is amazing, the physical buttons are awesome. I work inside and out and hunt and fish and I don't have to worry about my phone or put it in a expensive waterproof case that is **** ugly. \nI had these thoughts go through my head as I was standing there holding the phone with the salesperson talking to me.... I know kinda weird I know.. \nAs pretty as the regular version are and even with the finger print scanner and larger memory options available... And with the beautiful leather and frigging awesome camera controls and larger screen the g4 has... I didn't hesitate and said I will take this one... \nThis is a awesome phone, and despite the fact that in many people's minds and from the various articles and forums post lamenting that it isn't a \"premium build\" there is no other phone like it today that truly offers as much as this one does. \nSure it's the ugly sister to those who put style above function but when they are crying about scratched backs and waterlogged phones we will still be using ours... \nI love this phone for it's ruggedness and it's capabilities... and at the end of the day while others are seeking a charger or switching out batteries...
