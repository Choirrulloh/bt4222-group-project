So, he used an OTG cable to connect his pendrive. But that too didn't work. So pulled the OTG cable out and locked the screen manually. After a while when he tried to unlock it, he couldn't. The screen was dead blank and did not respond. Even the backlight for the home button didn't glow. When he tried calling the number, it was not reachable. I surfed in the internet about this, and i read about Sleep Of Death(SoD). But to fix that problem they said to hold the power button for 10-15 seconds. I tried that too. Nothing happened. Zenfone 5 has an in-built battery, so i cannot pull the battery out to make sure the device is off. I don't even know if the phone is still on or off. He updated 'ASUS Call Screen', 'Skype' and 'Camera' from Google play officially, the previous day. What should we do?\nAny kind of help is appreciable.\nThank you so much in advance...!", "time": "03-10-2015 01:20 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "The Asus Zenfone", "thread": [{"postID": "post4178398", "text": "From CES 2014:First look at the ASUS Zenfone 4, 5 and 6 | Android Central\nSome info comparing the phone released last year to give reference tot he Zenfone 2.\nThe 2 looks like it might be a nice little device considering the low price point.", "time": "01-14-2015 09:00 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4205895", "text": "Asus Zenfone 5 value for money\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "01-30-2015 08:57 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "How do I disable talk to speech?", "thread": [{"postID": "post3803134", "text": "hello...im having problem right now, im using asus zenfone 5...and this pop up always came out, \"unfortunately, google talk to speech engine has stopped...i dont know whats wrong but i dont want this function very annoying i try to disable this function and searching it everywhere but still nothing, please help me", "time": "07-31-2014 11:50 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post3803181", "text": "Welcome to Android Central! Does a reboot help at all?\nIf not, make sure Google Text-to-Speech is fully updated. Go to the Google Play Store, and search for Google Text-to-Speech. If it says \"Update,\" then tap on it. If you've never updated it before, the Play Store usually won't prompt you for the first update--you have to find it yourself (an odd bug that Google has never fixed).\nIf you're fully updated and it's still happening, try going to Settings>Apps>All, select Google Text-to-speech Engine, and Clear Cache/Clear Data, then Force Stop. Now see if it happens again. If you never use Text-to-Speech, you can Disable this app as well.", "time": "07-31-2014 12:11 PM", "replies": []}]}]
