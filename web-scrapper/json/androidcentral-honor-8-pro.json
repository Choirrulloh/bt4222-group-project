Huawei honor is going to do what's best for sales in terms of their light presence here in the US and since the honor 8 did so well it just makes sense to me that the next US release will carry on the name of the honor 8 but will be the pro version. In a few months I think they will release their next upper end Honor phone. It won't be the Honor 9 I don't seem to think now like I used to but now I'm thinking it will be the honor 8 pro instead. Can anyone tell me the specs of this device like what Kirin processor it has and like the screen size please? If indeed they do release the honor 8 pro I think I'll be in line to get one as the regular honor 8 is hardly even short of today's flagship phones that you can buy for an incredible price. Depending on the honor 8 pro screen size will be whether I would get it or not. I personally like the 5.2 screen size of the regular honor 8. It's plenty big enough to watch movies on but still small enough to almost manage with one hand most of the time.
