An $1150 Chromebook I would expect to have very similar specs and to have performance that's on par. \nThere are two types of people that should be choosing Windows 10 (full version) over ChromeOS on laptops: Those who are seriously into PC gaming, yet still want to do so on a laptop for unknown reasons and those who need very specific applications that are only available on desktop. Examples of that include... pretty close to nothing. 7 years ago there was a big gap in the apps available, but Photoshop, Office, most everything that normal consumers are using are all available on ChromeOS now or through their own webapps, which obviously work in a browser. \nIn addition to security, Google also has a MUCH better privacy policy than Microsoft, who gives themselves permission to and actually does share user data with third parties in exchange for compensation. Google denies themselves that permission and actually sticks to their guns on it. \nThe more direct comparison, Windows 10 S vs Chromebook, Windows 10 S comes out looking like garbage because the Windows store sucks, it's apps are largely made up of total crap, spyware, etc while the largest app makers simply aren't supporting that system and it's still filled with many of the same security flaws as regular windows. In addition, somewhere around 4 times as many people choose Chrome over Edge and over 11 times as many people use Google to search rather than Bing. If you have to be restricted to one or the other, Chrome is the obvious better choice.\nFor me personally, it depends on what I need it for. Anything that I do that isn't gaming is going to be easy to do on ChromeOS, assuming I can get a Chromebook with sufficient power for graphics to watch movies occasionally. And for gaming, even the best gaming laptops suck compared to a comparably priced gaming PC, so my personal preference is a Windows PC and a Chromebook.", "time": "09-25-2017 12:31 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6060997", "text": "Here's my take... if you need to do something it cant do, then its just not for you... but you could still run linux on it and likely run that app.\nSo, for the money the hardware is spot on. That's all that needs to be said there.\nNext, the chrome OS - it is simply the best internet browsing experience of any machine when you combine the chrome OS and this hardware. Viruses are no issue when surfing. It is lightning fast. There is nothing better. These days, you can do almost anything on the cloud and with web apps.\nAndroid assitant - if you like it on your phone and the power and ease of use, imagine that on your laptop.\nAnd finally, Android Apps - greatest library of apps of all time and the bonus is you already have purchased them on your phone. With PC/Mac you might have to buy licenses all over again for certain apps. I for one accept our Google overlords LOL because of the vast integration across their entire platform. It's simply amazing what you can do when you know how to harness it and tie it all together.\nOh and I almost forgot. Say goodbye to devastatiing software crashes. Your fix is as quick as a few minutes by resetting the machine and logging in. Settings and everything is on the cloud. You can even set up a full backup that can be accomplished without looking around for backup and OEM DVDs to boot from. It's so simple and so fast to recover and set up from the start.", "time": "11-08-2017 09:55 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5992150", "text": "^^^This ought to be a blog post.", "time": "09-25-2017 12:55 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5992226", "text": "It's long enough", "time": "09-25-2017 01:41 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5992274", "text": "Needs moar wordz!", "time": "09-25-2017 02:16 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5992271", "text": "I think you mean a guest Editor's Desk article!\nOK. I'd have to see for myself how well desktop apps, esp. Adobe InDesign, work on Chrome OS before I took the plunge myself. Then again, I can't think of any Adobe apps I wouldn't rather use on a desktop attached to at least one honkin' big monitor.\nSo my TL;DR take away re. Chrome OS/Pixelbook boils down to security, privacy, web integration, anything's better than the Windows Store, and comfort in knowing that nobody's sticking you with a 25W power supply or suchlike crapola.
