I am so frustrated.\nI bought a new Galaxy S5 Active (not refurbished) about 5 weeks ago. Ever since then, I have had issues with my home Xfinity/Comcast WiFi network. When I bought the phone, I did a transfer of data from my old phone and had issues with upgrading to the new software version. I used the ATT&T Transfer app and it hung for hours and I had to manually stop it. Weird. So, I took the phone to a Samsung Tech at Best Buy, and they were able to force the upgrade. I wonder if I should have done a Factory Reset from day one??? So it had initial problems, transferring data and upgrading.\nI use an Xfinity Arris TG862G.\nAnyway, we have a home Xfinity WiFi network. I guess the router is at least 2 years old, maybe older. Not always, but most of the time, my phone shows up as a very weak connection. In fact, when this all started, I noticed having my old phone on the network, I assumed was taking up too much bandwidth because when I shut it down, my new phone suddenly connected great! Then after that software upgrade, it continued great for a few weeks. Now, it is always strong and solid with WiFi out of our home, and works well on all WiFi networks except our home Xfinity network. We have about 5 other Apple devices that all connect well, at about 50-60 db (RSSI level), but my phone maintains about a 20 - 35 db connection strength. All other phones on the network are fine. Once in a while it connects great and jumps up to 50+, but most of the time, it has issues connecting, horrible performance and continues to drop the connection. I installed some WiFi tools, signal boosters that help a little. In addition to the weak connection and internet hanging all the time, I am not getting Authentication Error like every 20 minutes or so, and I have to reconnect. It keeps happening, and only on the home network. \nWhy only my phone and my home WiFi router? Its an Arris unit. I have tried checking the Ghz setting but I think the modem/router is 2.4Ghz only. I have done Wireless router resets, unplugged it, restarted it, rest my Galaxy by removing batter and cards, manually connecting to the WiFi network, cleared cache, etc. I have NOT done a Factory Reset yet, and may do that tonight. Maybe I should have done that from day one?! But still, why only my home network? \nAnother weird thing is that when I use Samsung Smart Switch on my laptop to backup my phone, the Smart Switch app is unable to recognize my phone! So, I can't back it up! Ugh!\nI bought the phone from Gadget Wizards online, new, and they have great customer service. They said I can return it, but it seems weird why this is isolated to my phone and Xifinity WiFi.\nThoughts? Do a reset? Any setting I should check? WiFi hotspot setting?

I have a handful of questions about it and about smart phones running the Android O/S. I'm a semi-retired IT Geek and my system runs Linux (Ubuntu 16.10 with GNOME at present) so I'm not entirely clueless, but at the same time, when it comes to the Android O/S and smart phones as a class of technology, I'm still pretty green. I'm hoping all of you can help me fix that shortcoming! I'll keep the questions as brief as possible. BTW - the model number of my S5 is: SM-G900A.\n1) The phone still is using the same 2800 mAh Lithium Ion battery it came with. It really needs to be replaced, but... As an interim solution, I picked up a 50,000 mAh battery pack. It works fine, but it has both a 1 and a 2 Amp port. Looking at the charger that came with the phone, it states that its output is 1.1 Amps. My question is: Can I safely connect my phone to the 2 Amp port to charge it, or not?\n2) As I carry the phone around with me, either in a hip pocket or in my shirt pocket, when I bring it out to use it, it seems to have launched at least one and sometimes more than one app. The only thing I can figure out is that the AMOLED touch screen is so sensitive, riding around in my pocket is sufficient to activate it (which is funny in a way b/c there have been times when I try to make it do something and I practically have to beat on it before it does more than just smirk at me!). My question: WHAT can be done to DECREASE the sensitivity of the touch screen beyond using the phone's settings? Alternatively, is there some method by which you can suspend the phone's actions except for receiving calls/texts, etc?\n3) FINALLY (for now) , I connect my phone to my computer when I'm at home to a - charge it and b - upload files to and download files from it. Occasionally, I will go exploring inside the phone using my computer's file manager (Nautilus). What's odd is that there appear to be a large number of directories especially within the phone's memory, that are completely empty (or do they just appear to be empty?). That's my last question for now: Is there a way that I can have complete access to the data in my phone's memory as well as on the SD Card I have installed in it? Before you suggest that I root my phone, I tried that with a couple of previous phones and got mixed results at best. In one case, I 'bricked' the phone and that did not make me at all happy!\nThat's enough for now (I'm sure you all agree as well!). I do appreciate the help you can provide for me in learning the 'facts of life' about smart phones!", "time": "04-05-2017 07:30 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5745765", "text": "1. Yes it's OK to use the 2A port. Theoretically with a 2800mAh battery if you had a 2.8A charger that would still be OK (1A = 1000mA). And actually if you had a charging device that can supply up to 4A you'd still be OK as your S5 is only going to be pulling in what it needs. Also, while your battery is charging it will initially start to require a higher number of amperage and then it gradually fades as it gets charged up -- so (completely made up numbers here) if your battery is at 45% when you plug it in to get charged it might pull in 1950mA but by the time it's close to done, say 98% it might only be pulling in 100mA.\n2. No comment on what you're asking specifically. I use a phone holster with a belt clip. Some view them as silly or geeky-looking but I prefer it because I never have to worry about what pocket to use or leaving my phone on a table somewhere, it's always in the same place on my hip. Plus with my phone not being in any pocket there's less of a chance inadvertent contact with the screen will be an issue.\n3. Not quite sure which directories you're referring to, but running a Linux system (also a Linux user, Slackware since 2003) does allow you to access more things with less friction than say a Windows box. There's a basic file manager that Samsung includes, look for the 'My Files' app in your Apps menu, and be sure to go into its Settings menu and check off the boxes for 'Show hidden files' and 'Show file extension'. Using My Files go into some of those directories in question and see if they're still empty, or not.", "time": "04-05-2017 08:11 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5748054", "text": "Thank you VERY much for your reply to my questions! I'm sorry that it took me this long to return and acknowledge your response. \nI too use a holster for my S5. One that actually has a belt loop since I have had bad luck with the holster and phone getting detached from my belt and going MIA. Even so, using my holster (which fits very snugly around the phone by design), I have pulled the phone out to find applications open and I cannot account for how that happened. However, my index of suspicion is high that somehow pressure was applied to the touchscreen in such a manner that the phone thought I wanted the offending application to be opened.\nI think that the answer to this issue is to A) shorten the length of time the display is active without input and/or B) Discover how to lock the phone's display immediately before stowing it.\nTo answer your question about my third question: I wish to have unrestricted access to ALL of the files on my phone. Not because I have any desire to tinker with them unnecessarily, but on the general principle that it is MY phone and I insist on the right to have access to ALL of the information it contains - ALL the information. When it comes to the O/S, I'm sure that Google would take exception to my point of view, but FWIW Google can go straight to Hell and right along with the horse they rode in on! \"Don't Be Evil\" my a**! \nAnd closely related to my desire to have unfettered access to all the data contained on my phone is the crapware installed on it as a consequence of being associated with AT&T. I would gladly give a buffalo nickel (if I had one to give!) to be given directions on how to remove these applications from my phone. I have all of them turned off or otherwise disabled, I would just as soon not have them taking up any of the measly 16GB of memory my S5 has, Likewise with the crapware installed by Google, although I grudgingly acknowledge that some of them may be unavoidable unless I want to get root access and replace the O/S and everything else. As I said previously, I'm just not willing to go that route....not yet at any rate!\nI did appreciate the insight about the built in file manager. When I opened it, I found that the show hidden files feature was not enabled, so I enabled it, however I have not had the time yet to go surfing around in my phone yet through Nautilus.

Paul, you say you do this for a living and hopes are being lost that you are going to get back with us with any information. After all, it's been six months since you said you would look into it.\nTo those of you that have this problem. The news gets worse. At least for me it did. I made the mistake of not having insurance. Warranty is up as far as I know. Phone is over a year old. Mine started one day in the car....my wife was driving...it's okay. My phone was sitting between us. I looked down and saw that my phone had gone into a download mode. Said it was DOWNLOADING. I know what downloading is, but never saw this screen before. So I left it going as it instructed to not disconnect the phone...disconnect from what....the battery? Anyway, the car ride was about another 40 minutes and the phone was still on this screen....Big ugly android guy that was downloading something. Well, we stayed at my in-laws for a few hours and left. My phone was still in that mode. I decided to wait until I got home. I was so worried that, if I pulled the battery, the phone was going to be ruined. After the long ride home, I get inside the house and decide to just pull the battery and restart. Luckily the phone booted just fine. But, over these last few months, my phone continued to do this. Would be using the phone and suddenly it would go to that big ugly guy again and telling me it was downloading. 15 or 20 minutes later I would pull the battery and all was fine. After a while I would just pull the batter immediately after seeing that ugly droid. Then my phone in the last 4 or 5 weeks started restarting. I could be in the middle of typing a text message and it would just reboot. I started searching online for others with this problem and saw things about the \"CUSTOM\" word showing up. I checked on mine as it went through this process and, guess what, mine said it was CUSTOM. Brand new phone, never had anything done to other than download a few games from the Play Store. Then about a week and a half ago, my phone would only boot to a screen that told me that my phone will not boot because there had been something done to it that was not supposed to be done and to contact....either my carrier or Samsung....can't remember which. Now today, the phone threw me for a complete loop....literally. It boots to the Samsung screen, shuts off, turns itself back on, boots to the Samsung screen, shuts off, turns itself back on, boots to the Samsung screen, shuts off, turns itself...you get the picture. Now, my phone is the Note 4 with T-Mobile as my carrier. I'm thinking of chatting with T-Mobile or possibly Samsung, but I'm certain they will tell me that my phone had the rooting or custom system put on it or one of these things that people keep saying must have been what caused it. What caused it was a faulty phone that is almost 2 years old. Was brand new from T-Mobile and never had any customization done. So I would assume that some of you with this problem will eventually come into some, if not all, of the problems I have and will be out of a phone that cost you almost $800. Well, that's what I paid for it over a year ago. So if anyone....PAUL....really does do this for a living, or has come up with a solution, please enlighten us with this solution.\nThank you.", "time": "02-11-2016 10:02 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4994825", "text": "Reflash the stock ROM - see [Samsung] How to flash Stock ROM via ODIN.

Now that it has version 5.x you are screwed. I am in the same boat as you. Bought my phone from amazon 2 months ago. Didn't know a thing about rooting , roms, nothing,...was upgrading from a 2009 garmin phone. pulled my old mini sim from that phone, with at&t, trimmed it down to micro sim size and slapped it in the new phone, boom, no contract, new phone, same plan...good to go. 2 days later it starts downloading updates from at&t, I was like cool....maybe it will update itself all the way to marshmallow.....nope. stopped at 5.1.1 and I dislike the white blinding white back grounds when you go into settings. no way to fix it either, none that I can find. So far I've inverted colors to black, under the vision settings option. tried a bunch of free crap on the g, play app store but nothing changes the settings background. I'm stuck with it. One trick I did find to do about the bloat ware was to disable all of them, and set them to never update, ever. I had to factory reset the phone 4 times though before I learned how to do that. the key is to keep it off of wifi until you lsolate and lock down all those apps before you let it connect for the first time. It's like trying to pin down a virus. So, I'm only running ccleaner, firefox,google play services,googleplay store,Lookout,and translate as active apps on this phone so far. everything else is disabled. mobile data stays off. gps stays off, everything I can think of is shut off and not allowed to update itself. I managed to free up 9.67gb of available space on the core storage and I just added a 32 gb sd card. Before with all the bloatware updating and running there was only 6gigs free on the phone. This is the best I can do. Maybe someone else can chime in if they have a better solution.

I'm considering a spare battery that charges in my tank bag and just swap them out, but that just seems like a lot of rigamarole. Is there such a thing as a cable that locks in hard to reduce vibration? \nI guess that's it. Charging and vibration are the final pieces to the puzzle.

If you leave the cord attached all of the time, I'd just dab some clear silicone around all sides of it and call it a day. Silicone is obviously waterproof, so as long as you get complete coverage, you're golden. And once it dries it's definitely strong enough to hold the cord in there, short of you accidentally snagging it in some manner. (zip ties could potentially help remedy that though.)\nAnother option (albeit a slightly more extreme one) could be to remotely mount the battery elsewhere and run a wire to the phone. I'm not sure if you'd be able to solder to the normal contacts that are exposed in the battery slot (for whatever reason, I'm leaning towards guessing that the answer to that is No.), so you'd have to open it up and solder inside or get otherwise creative... I don't know if that's even a viable idea, but just thought I'd plant the seed...\nAs for vibration, if you mount the phone to any surface on the bike, you're going to get a hell of a lot of vibration regardless of rubber damping. You need to create some sort of seperation... and as I'm typing this, I just got a goofy-*** idea, but it just might work: How about a balloon? What if you got a small balloon, only blew a little bit of air into it, and put that behind the phone? It would flatten out and conform to whatever shape is behind it, but it would create a soft spot for the phone to lay against. Then use some Saran Wrap, folded lengthwise, to wrap around the phone and the bike frame / tank / whatever...?? That would be some straight up MacGuiver shiznit right there! lol\nGood luck!

Unless of course your with one of the carriers that do Not Lock the Bootloaders down (T-Mobile is the only one I can think of that doesn't lock all their phones down to hell) than you can get some good developers working on the device and ironing out the issues that where left behind after they were released. I honestly wish the companies making phones and the carriers would use the Beta Testing Community more because issues would be easier to find out as the people who use them use them in real life scenarios as opposed to a QC doing the said work and doing that on limited real world terms.

Working in a manner like it has never done before. it was very responsive and I noticed some of the settings menus were changed very slightly.then Google started to restore apps update as put back apps, you name it. that's when it started to function just like its old self if not a little bit different for the worse .Samsung's built in Knox security environment as well as the security enhancements for Android coupled with the fact that Google and chrome all backup and automatically restore settings from and to your devices as well as sharing all of them to all of your devices unless settings turn off completely on every device and on every app on every copy even desktop as well. so even though my expectations for the experience of 5.0 lollipop on my s5 active were greatly exceeded, it was disappointing an hour later to see my phone practically back the way it was before I updated it which was plain boring and basically a chunk of plastic that had to many buttons that didn't do much. as for the Google issue I'm going to sign a Google account to every single one of my devices that way it only syncs to itselfand then I'll just set the cloud to share with each other..this syncing business is out of control I tell ya, lol\nRob :-)", "time": "04-18-2015 02:38 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4378115", "text": "I installed this update last night....DON'T DO IT....

Combine these varying modifications of Android with the challenge that app developers have of making apps that are compatible with the many kinds of hardware and firmware, and you'll inevitably find some incompatibilities that arise.

Or, if not then maybe you just want to experiment. Nothing wrong with that, but there's some things you should know and consider first to avoid unnecessary grief.\nRooting grants full administrator permissions to the user, rather than limited user permissions. The good is that this allows you to do basically anything to any files on the device. It allows full control of everything on the device. The bad is that it also means you have full permission to muck up anything on the device. It also reduces the security of the phone somewhat.\nI used to root every phone I had. But I no longer root my daily driver phone that I cannot do without. As hardware and software has improved the need to root has declined. Now I do not recommend rooting unless you have a specific need or just want to experiment on a spare device.\nIf you decide you really do need and want to root, first do a LOT of reading. See if there's a subforum here for your phone. You should check out the XDA Developer forum for information too, but be sure to read first and post later there as it's not a very n00b-friendly site. And as always, for questions this forum and Google search are your friends.\nThere's some chance a mistake could 'brick' your phone (make it unusable). Make sure you understand why you're rooting, the exact procedures required and all the terminology. And it's absolutely critical to have a recovery plan and backups in case things go bad.\nDO NOT try to install a ROM that is intended for any phone except your exact model! If you have questions post back here before proceeding and someone will help.\nDon't forget to do backups!

I know its unlikely any of you have had both phones, but I figure some of you may have had the chance to try both.\n1. Battery life:\nBoth phones have identical hardware and batteries (with the exception of no fingerprint scanner or usb 3.0 on the active). Therefore both phones should have identical battery life. I have read reviews that suggest the battery life of the active is slightly worse. Can anyone confirm or disprove this?\n2. Charge time:\nS5 has usb 3.0, active has 2.0. I believe 3.0 utilizes higher current. Is the charge time of the active significantly slower or even perceptibly slower?\n3. Water resistance:\nI know the S5 and active should be submersible to some extent. I have read reviews about the active getting wet (not even submerged) and it causing damage. Has anyone experienced this first hand?\n4. Pocket dialing:\nI also read a review talking about how the active's physical buttons caused pocket dialing regularly. Have any of you experienced this? For those of you that have, is there a solution besides using a pass code/pattern?\n5. Temperature testing:\nI plan to use this phone when snowboarding and hiking regularly. The phone will likely see single digit temps. I have had problems with every phone I have ever owned turning off in cold temps. Has anyone actually tested the extreme temperature range this phone claims it operates within?\nThanks in advance", "time": "09-12-2014 06:14 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post3893511", "text": "I can't really say much to the battery difference.

There have certainly been those who had no problem with water and some have even taken pictures under water. I myself prefer not to tempt the gods. :-)\nI have never **** dialed with this phone but I would definitely agree that the power button gets hit several times a day putting in and out of things.

Battery life is great, I'm on the phone at least 15-20 times a day with clients, use GPS all the time (I never turn off location), take photos of before and after my work, and if I'm in the car, bluetooth is on for music. Phone goes on at 0600, off at 2300, I still have at least 50% left. I have gone 2 full days between charges if I forget to plug it in, but I've never had a dead battery.\n2. I plug mine in overnight, so I cannot answer this, I have no idea how long it takes to charge.\n3. My phone has been wet many times, I work outside in all weather conditions. None of the \"water damage\" stickers have changed color, and the phone runs perfectly.\n4. This was my one complaint. The power button is WAY to easy to push when you put the phone in your pocket, turning on the display, and leaving the phone open to booty-dialing, so choosing the pattern lock is almost mandatory. I solved this by getting a bumper case from the AT&T store. Sure, I overpaid at almost $16.00 for 0.40 cents of plastic and rubber, but I like it, and the charging port is still accessible. Best of all, the power button is much harder to push inadvertently. \n5. As I said, I'm outdoors all day, the phone works at 105F just like it works at 22F, it snowed almost 2 inches here the other day, and yes, I did use the Active during a period that was close to white-out (I couldn't see across the street), and while the touchscreen doesn't work all that well when wet (although it was visible), the phone stayed dry inside. \nI hope you end up with the phone that makes you happiest, in my particular case, the Active is the choice.

I was on the phone with my mother the other night and usually it's a 3 hour long session of her talking about this and that, which can become tiresome, and make me lose track of things I should or want to be doing. I put her on speakerphone, because smartphones have never been comfortable for long periods of time up to my ear. After about an hour I got the idea of leaving her on speakerphone, putting the phone down, and taking a shower. Now this is the point I'm trying to make, she never once actually knew I was in the shower and when I told her afterward, she told me that she never even heard the water running. That's how good the speakerphone seems to be on this phone. I remember with my S3, she could always hear the water running when I would wash the dishes, so it seems that it wouldn't be a problem with this phone, being that she couldn't hear the shower going.", "time": "08-28-2014 06:11 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post3862050", "text": "So what if that whole time she asked you a question?
