My carrier is Simple Mobile which is a MVNO of T-Mobile. One phone is for my use and the other for my son. My previous device was a HTC One M7.\nRight out of the box the battery performance was a bit disappointing. My M7 could last a whole day but the M9 lasts about 4-5 hours max on moderate usage which is mostly browsing, calls, text, whatsapp with Location off, BT off, even WIFI off at times.\nWithin three months the battery went from last 4-5 hours to only 2 hours. Basically, any time the battery indicator reaches 40% its an immediate death.\nThis gets progressively worse and worse. At this moment, eight months after initial purchase, the phone will die when it reaches 82% power. This translates into about 20 minutes of usages per full charge.\nI have contacted HTC by email twice since the phone is still supposedly under the original 1 year warranty, but no response from HTC. However when I go to one of those IMEI checker and typed mine in, it shows the warranty period is over, and was over BEFORE I even made the purchase.\nWhile I have been struggling with this, my son's phone - identical model, identical carrier, seems to run fine. He gets about six hours out of it, so the theory is my particular device may be defective. Then last week, out of the blue, he told me his phone shuts down suddenly at 30% for no reason, and on powering back up it shows 4% battery. So it seems his phone is having the early stage of the same issue, only it's not as bad as mine, YET.\nWhen the phone gets it's sudden death and when it does come back, half the time it will remove all the widgets I have on the screen.\nI have the stock phone, that came with Android version 7.0, security patch level 2-1-2017, software number 4.27.531.6.\nI have done a few things so far to get some clarity of the problem.\n(1) I have tried charging it with the phone on vs phone off, didn't make a difference.\n(2) I have rebooted to safe mode, and it appears the battery drain (which runs about 1+% a minute with no active usage) is the same.\n(3) I have tried the battery recaliberation steps by powering off then holding the volume up + down + power buttons for two minutes plus and that didn't seem to make any difference, although the instructions said to turn off \"fast boot\" which on my phone under Power settings > Battery I do not have such an option.\n(3) I have wiped the partition cache when the battery was fully charged at 100%, and after the partition charge the phone reboots to 73%. Not sure I understand what happened here, unless the actual process to wipe the partition cache drained 27% of the battery. I then recharged it to 100%, and the problem persists. Super quick drain, and shuts down once reached 80%, Basically, once it reaches 80% battery level, it shuts down, if you then plug in the charger, the battery says 0%.\nI contemplated ordering a new M9 battery, but looking at the youtube video on the process, I am not at all confident that I can do it without damaging the phone itself.\nI have to admit, I have not been careful to always use the OEM HTC charger and cable. I have been using HTC for a long time, and have the older charger from S1, M7, M8, various charging cables from an assortment of power banks, and didn't think twice about always charging with original cable and charger. Also, I typically leave the phone charging overnight when I go to bed. My car has a few USB ports and at times I would plug that into my car's USB port to charge if battery level is low. I have a few receptacles in the office with those USB sockets, and again I plug in to charge, not even sure what output amps and voltages of those are. I never had to charge while driving or in the office for older HTC phones as they last the whole day, the M9 I was charging in mid day and more and more. Looking at the charger I used the most it says the output is 5V 1.8A. I know my son uses the OEM charger most of the time.\nThe questions I have are:\n(A) Does this seem like a software issue or hardware issue? Could my charging it with non M9 chargers damaged something?\n(B) Is it a waste of time to continue to pursue with HTC a warranty claim to try and get my phone (and possibly my son's phone if it continues to degrade) serviced?\n(C) Should I try to swap out a new battery? By myself or by a local phone repair shop? I am fairly handy but the process involved prying teasing loose some glued on parts that just doesn't seem it was designed to be serviced.\nThanks in advance for any comment.", "time": "12-27-2017 08:16 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6128497", "text": "its not a fault . as its a battery hunger phone. mine is also same.", "time": "01-06-2018 06:20 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6168120", "text": "I've had this problem with my current & last HTC One M9. I disagree with the poster who states that \"it's not a fault just a power hungry phone\" if that were true it would not be degenerative over time. I've tried everything you suggested& more, I also stop at attempting battery replacement for the same reasons + those who have successfully done so say it doesn't fix the problem. While the phone was great while it lasted we're outside of its anticipated useful lifetime & HTC encourages us to replace our phones with the U11. This could be a deliberate software feature much like what apple did to their models older than iPhone5 with some code attached to an update. They are currently involved in a class action suit over this (apple)\nI'm ditching my HTC and getting an Honor 7x. Experts have told me that while the One M9 has some great features, it was never built to last this long. By continuing to use them it's in HTC's best interest to create or exploit some failure mode. I believe our troubles are just so. Why would a phone manufacturer want their phones to last a particularly long time? How is that good business? Customers who don't spend on the latest & greatest at least every couple years are a drag on the company. Customers who can't afford to aren't customers they want. The workmanship and materials that would be required for a phone lasting say 5-7 years would not add much to assembly cost but would definitely damage the bottom line.

I wanted to start using it so I didn't even pay attention to that damn tray and it's because I am a fking genius. I used micro SIM before and I had no idea. And I have hard time reading guidelines. \nSo I inserted that card without a tray and I was alarmed when it said there's no SIM card. So I wanted to take it out and back in but well, I couldn't. In guidelines I read about that tray so I panicked. I tried to find a way to take it out but I was afraid I will screw something up. But I had a moment of marvelous genius. \nIf someone put a nano card without a tray, this is what you need to do:\n1. Find a sheet of transparent, thick plastic, it is widely used as covers for documents etc. It looks like this Make sure it's hard, not soft, soft won't help you. There are two kinds of that plastic and you must get hard one. \n2. Cut two strips, they must be as wide as a nano card and 5-6 cm long (so you can grab them)\n3. Carefully place two strips under and over a stuck card, make sure you don't pry too hard to not to break something inside the slot\n4. Try to remove the card with strips of plastic, I succeeded after first try. It's because a card with two plastic strips under and over is thicker so you can take it out. \n5. Be very careful because it's my own, homemade idea, I was desperate but it helped. I felt like a ******* genius after that so I decided to share it with other (accidental or not) blockheads. So, people, read the guidelines. I just learned that.

Unfortunately, on the pixel the edge of the micro sim got behind a lip on the front edge of the phone, so I could not get the plastic behind there. kusumitha's method of just using one plastic didn't work, because it just pulled the sim card tighter behind the lip when pulled at 90 degrees.\nSo, the winning system was using a couple safety pins bent open, and VERY patiently working it out of the slot. It took about 20 minutes. I didn't use both safety pins at once. One was larger, and one was smaller. \nOk - off to get a nano sim.\nMark in Sandy Eggo", "time": "03-08-2017 06:10 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6154449", "text": "Help me please!!!

I bought it just before moving overseas and unfortunately it's developed a really nasty tendency to turn itself off. And not just off either \u2013 it's a brick until I get it on a charger. Completely unresponsive to hard reset, etc. Nothing. Doesn't matter what % the battery is on.\nNormally I'd just return it, but unfortunately it's not an option as I'm in the other Hemisphere for the foreseeable future with work. Would appreciate any insight at all. The self test passes with no problem, so I'm kind of stuck.\nSymptoms\n-The aforementioned bricking. When it receives charge, it boots as if it had been completely depleted. It never bricks while on charge.\n-When I do reboot it, if the battery is higher than 33%, it will ALWAYS display 33% until charge drops below. I've had it die at 90%, rebooted it, and it stayed on 33% for 4 hours.\n-It often (although not always) clears all widgets, but not app shortcuts.\n-It's always triggered by opening an app or unlocking the phone. The Camera is by far the worst for it, but everything is suspect, from the gallery to Facebook. If an app opens successfully, I can use it without issue. The camera is a dice roll on each photo however.\n-If I do reboot it and remove it from charge, the next few minutes are very high risk and likely to brick it again. If I remove while it'll still turning on it's very likely to turn off as it reaches the splash screen.\n-Could be completely unrelated \u2013 but when charging it often drops off charge for a split second.\nI'd much rather get it repaired than replace it, but I'm not sure where to start? I suspect the battery mostly (possibly not coping sudden demand from the CPU?) but I'd be lying if I said I had any firm idea. Additionally, It's worked fault free for up to a month at a time...\nWould appreciate your thoughts.

Maybe the phone either\na. does an icon redundancy check on start, sees that the icons already exist in the folder, and deletes the non-folder copies?

I unmounted the original, turned the phone off, then removed the card and put it in an adapter to use on my PC. I then backed up everything on my PC drive. So far so good.\nNext up, I put the new card in and started the phone and on boot completion I chose to format as internal. It did its thing, I followed the prompts, and soon it was ready and I hooked the phone up to my PC. It saw the phone's new storage and let me begin dumping my music and photos back onto the phone. I copied and pasted the DCIM and Music folders to it and everything went across the USB link smoothly.\nI rebooted the phone and even after a few hours, no media. File explorers saw the files. My PC saw the files. Gallery and Music did not. Neither did VLC until I selected the folders option. In folder mode, it saw everything. Having been through this on Android 5, I went to Media Storage, cleared data, and did the same for Music and Gallery, and then rebooted. I waited overnight and still no dice.\nI tried two media rescan apps from the store, still no change.\nSo, I deleted as much as I could from the SD card, uninstalling legions of apps, and finally cleared enough space to migrate the SD data back to the internal space and once done, formatted the SD card as external and for good measure I unmounted it, then repeated the clearing of the media storage data and the others, rebooting.\nStill no dice. Remember now, the music and photos are on the internal space so it shouldn't be an SD card or external vs internal formatting issue.\nThat being the case, I reformatted the card as internal, following the menu option to migrate the data back. I reinstalled all the apps I needed. The apps run nice and fast from this new SD card. But, Android 6 media storage is just not indexing the media. No pictures in Gallery. No music in Music. All files are there per both PC and the phone's own file managers.\nAnd yes, I looked for .nomedia entries in the affected places. Nothing. Before, Gallery showed stuff downloaded on Twitter and Facebook. Music would see music in the Download folder and I had playlists aplenty. All the media was being seen.\nAs I said, I had this happen on the Android 5 load the phone came with once. For some reason it would occasionally lose media storage data on a reboot. I did extensive searching and this dumping of the media storage data was the eventual fix. However, it should index overnight. If it is taking more than eight hours, something is off. The problem went away with the Android 6 upgrade but here I am again.\nI have once more cleared the data on Media Storage, Gallery, and Music and rebooted and the phone is sitting untouched. I'm afraid it isn't going away this time.\nAny ideas?\nEDIT: Pictures taken by the camera show in Gallery, but none of the older ones.

It was NOT there before. I didn't see it when hooked to the PC despite setting it to show hidden files. Suddenly, the phone's native file explorer was showing it. I deleted it, rescanned, and presto. Music and photos were in Music and Gallery.\nAndroid devs REALLY REALLY REALLY need to upgrade the Media Storage app and revamp it so that you can actually select it as an app, see what it has indexed, tell it to reindex if needed, and show you which folders are reporting a .nomedia file and so forth.

Fire hazard and terrible phone", "thread": [{"postID": "post5467717", "text": "I just wanted to know everyone's thoughts/experiences with the m9 so far.\nSo over the last few years I have had a fair few phones from iPhones to Samsung galaxy's. I have now ordered a oneplus 3 to see me through to the end of my contract as this phone is just dangerous. When I fist opened the box I was delighted with the phone and as you do thought it was the best thing ever, but this was short lived and has now turned into the worst 12 months of phone ownership ever. So I thought I would share my experiences with others below.\nFirst issue was charging. A few months ago my USB port decided it was only going to work intermittently. So plug unplug four of 5 times to get the charging icon. With this came a new issue, it began to think that it was docked and went into car mode when on charge. This then began happening when not on charge just randomly throughout the day ranging from once or twice a day to every 3 minutes. Battery drain is terrible and often end up changing by lunchtime just to see out the end of work. \nThen the thing started to overheat, and I mean seriously overheat. I know these get warm usually but this thing is now a fire hazard. It started when I put my phone on charge one night came to it in the morning to pick it up and it literally felt like it was burning my skin, I had to leave it on a cold surface for 15 mins before being able to pick it up. This is now regular when using the HTC charger so I started recording battery temps at one point it was 69\u00b0C. I now only charge my phone when I can see it never overnight as batteries and high temps aren't a great pairing. \nAlso to mention the screen seems to develop lines when in my pocket for extended periods of time. This has happened to me a few times now on flights but returns to normal after a few hours. A bit of googling seems this is quite common. \nContacted HTC numerous times via email and tried ringing but never got through or got a reply.

So I have lot's of music on my itunes, so I went onto google, downloaded HTC Sync Manager, plugged in my phone, and was ready to sync some of my jams onto my phone, only to notice that my phone would be recognized for about a split second, and then it would disconnect. I have windows 8.1, and i've tried looking into the matter using this forum, but couldn't find anything that seemed to work. Also, the 'would you like to do with the device you connected' message pop up in the top right corner of my screen 3 times. \n2. I noticed that I don't have an equalizer for my music :/. Alright maybe google has an answer and I found http://htc-one.wonderhowto.com/how-to/boost-your-htc-ones-audio-quality-with-snapdragon-audio-0155924/ I thought i'd give it a shot. So I went to download it and when I clicked on the link using my phone, it read at the bottom \"No SD\". I found this a little odd because when I went into storage in settings, I could clearly see that I have a SanDisk 128GB with on 528mb used, and then the factory Storage, which has a remainder of 22GB. So I tried taking out the SD and downloading the file thinking that maybe it would force it to download to the factory storage but that didn't seem to do it. Same thing happened with ES File Explorer, it could not find my SD. \nAnyways thanks guys  Hopefully a solution can be found \n- Gavin", "time": "11-19-2016 12:06 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5571324", "text": "Welcome to Android Central!

Firstly, the phone overheats like crazy - but only sometimes. It did this before I even installed any apps so I know that if it is a software problem it is HTC's software problem, not mine. Unfortunately I am the one who has to deal with it. It doesn't happen always, but the phone does stay much warmer than any other device I've had and quite honestly I'm surprised it hasn't given itself heatstroke. Seriously, the fact that it can withstand its own heat problem soeaks to the heartiness of the rest of the phone. Not an acceptable problem to allow a device to be released with. Seriously HTC, get your *** together before you release your product. I also know that if it was a hardware problem it is a hardware problem for all (or at least most) HTC One m9 users. I know this because as soon as I noticed the heat issue I sent it back and got a replacement which had the same problem PLUS a charging problem. So I sent that one back, too and the newest one was working fine. Then one day it started having the same problems. It would get so hot and it was charging extremely slowly. If I was using it while it was charging the battery pecentage would still drain - slowly but it was going down. I would have returned it again if it hadn't been such a good phone otherwise. So I hung on to it and have spend a lot of time scouring the internet looking for solutions. Then HTC released a software update that was supposed to fix charging and overheating problems. That worked for about 3 days. Arg. So now I have a phone that regularly gets very hot and about 1/6th of the time charges incredibly slowly. There is nothing wrong with the port or the cable. I am using a rapid charge HTC charger. I have tried different cables and ports but it doesnt make a difference. I have always had trouble getting it to onnect to my Windows 7 machine - every time I hook it up I have to go to the device manager and uninstall the device (not just the drivers) and reinstall it and then it reads fine. But that is a different issue - I am pretty sure it is just a driver problem - the lady with HTC chat told me not to install their sync program under any circumstances (which I hadn't done anyways). Just thought I would throw that out there while we were discussing fixes for the problems people are having with this model. So, its not the charger, the cable, the port, the apps, the version...I have done a soft reset,a couple of hard resets (yay I get to install everything all over again) and I just recalibrated the battery. I'm not expecting too much but hey, let's see if it is at least a temporary fix. It is too late for me to return the phone now and if I could just solve this set of battery/charging issues I'll be really happy. I'm on a mission - if anyone has anymore suggestions please post them or feel free to email me at klear6@hotmail.com Thanks for your time.

This, unfortunately is quite a large negative.\nMy question to anyone who has experience with HTC and owns one of these phones is this...Since the phones release, has their been any updates dealing with the battery issue, prolonging battery life on the phone?\nHas the later version of Android 6.0 solved the battery issue?\nAlso final question, being an octa core phone, why is the battery so bad in the M9, when they specifically made the phone octa core with 4 lower powered cores to give the phone good battery management... i.e using the low powered cores for low intensive use such as browsing the web, and 4 high powered cores which kick in for high intensive use such as a very graphic intensive game. Is it that the M9 just needs a larger capacity battery, or is it purely contributed to poor software tuning for the battery and processors?\nCheers,\nMatt", "time": "06-22-2016 03:16 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5234957", "text": "If you plan on rooting the phone, youre almost 100% sure of getting between 4-5 hrs of SOT with the correct tweaks like greenify, naptime and some kernel tweaks.

The software plus the SD810 just weren't working well together... When we switch to power saver... The phone relies more on the a53 cores... Even for heavy tasks,the issue was this keeps the cores awake longer so that the tasks are completed, wasting power...Sadly depending on 8 a53 and a57 cores causes as much power usage... Because the a 57 cluster is very power hungry...if you ask me 8 cores is overkill especially with that a57 cluster. I get great battery life running the snapdragon 808 setup on my device,disabling 2 a57 cores.

Has the newest OS, and software updates. The problem I'm having is that my lock screen seems to be buggy. \nI have my display timeout set to 45 seconds, but I don't have a security screen. Just the \"swipe\" option, meaning in theory everytime the screen shuts off, I should have to swipe it up to unlock the phone after pushing the power button. The problem is, that doesn't work when the screen shuts off by the 45 second timeout. If the screen times out, and I press the power button, the phone just goes to the home screen, with no swipe screen to keep the phone from accidentally getting unlocked. This has caused me to open y phone a few times while in my pocket. \nBut, when I have the phone on, and I manually shut off the screen with the power button, the lock screen with swipe seems to work when I turn the phone on again. But only if I manually shut the screen with the power button. I know my previous M9 didn't do that. That phone, the lock screen would have swipe regardless. Also, my HTC One M7 didn't have this problem. \nSo did HTC just shaft me and change the way they do lock screen? Because I really don't want to have to put a password lock, and set it to \"power button automatically locks\", and lock time \"immediately\" to make the phone lock both by screen timeout, and by power button just to keep the phone from accidentally getting unlocked. That's very negative Nancy.", "time": "03-26-2016 12:57 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5096691", "text": "Welcome to Android Central! \nDid you ever figure this out?", "time": "03-31-2016 11:31 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5099327", "text": "I wouldn't say they shafted you but yes it is pretty much like Android is requiring a lock beginning with this new OS. Services like Google Wallet won't work without it. \nAs for your phone opening in your pocket, while I do use a lock screen, I've found that I can sometimes find my device waiting for the lock input if I'm hot and perspiring a little. I think this is due to the motion gestures I have set. \nBeing warm and humid doesn't explain the issue of being able to watch the screen timeout and touching the power button only to find it still unlocked. For that I have two possibilities. One, and I can't test this, but I also feel like it's the least likely so all you can do is look and see, but in your security settings there's a timer for how soon the lock screen will activate. Since I'm using the lock screen this setting is open for me but with you not using the lock screen I think it maybe greyed out. If not make sure it's set to effect immediately. Any time set there will cause a delay. Since I'm using the lock screen and have that setting open, even if I set the screen timeout to 10 sec my phone won't lock until that times out even if I press the power button, and I think the power button is the key here. \nThe use of the power button brings up my second more plausible theory. Something is keeping your phone awake. If you press the power button you are intentionally telling the device it's time to sleep. When you let the screen time out the phone is in limbo because of this other app that's running. The app thinks, \"the screen's off but I can run screen on or off, IDC.\" So the key will be to find this app. That would be where I'd start. There are several different ways to try and see what's running or keeping the phone awake. Looking at the power screen, looking at the app manager in the setting, looking at permissions, there are even apps that will tell you what's keeping your phone from sleeping. \nKnow this tho. I wouldn't install an app killer because they just eat up battery and resources trying to stop apps that are only going to reopen a moment later. If you find something try its settings or some onboard method to solve this.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "04-01-2016 07:26 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Fitting the M9 in a Samsung Gear VR", "thread": [{"postID": "post5091971", "text": "Hey there,\nMy GF got a free Gear VR with her S7 Edge.. now I have a HTC m9 and well it actually fits well.. it just doesn't clamp. now I'm curious.. is there no .. like 3d printed between piece that locks the micro usb of the Gear VR and just slides slightly over the m9?\nIt doesn't have to be much, like ~0.5 cm should be enough it's all about the clamping that's going wrong.

I gave up and bought a Kinivo bluetooth hands-free kit from Amazon for $35 that works better than stock.

Firstly, I know nothing about rooting and unlocking, but I have a Moto Droid Ultra and knew if I accepted the latest OTA, I would be at KitKat 4.4 and my FoxFi app would no longer work, based on the FoxFi notes. I read about Sunshine and contacted them. I explained my situation clearly and was told by Justin I should install Sunshine and then install the OTA. I then asked again, as I wanted to be sure about taking the OTA, as I really wanted FoxFi to work. I was again told to install Sunshine and take the OTA. I paid for and installed Sunshine. Then phone is unlocked. I then Contacted them again to tell them the phone was unlocked and were they sure if I installed the OTA, FoxFi would work. They said yes. So I installed the OTA and guess what...FoXFi no longer works! \nI emailed Justin and asked him for help. He told me it was not his problem and to contact FoxFi. I reminded him again that he told me to take the OTA. He again said it is not their problem and would not refund my money or help me. I had some choice words for him at that point, as I was basically ripped off. Again, I don't mind paying, but as I was taken advantage of by Sunshine and the root ninja. \nI've been open from the beginning that this is not my area of expertise. With all that said, can anyone offer any advice on what to do next so that FoxFi works again? I heard there is someone who can root your phone and solve this from a distance? Any suggestions are appreciated. I'm just a guy looking for help, who was taken advantage of. Thank you in advance for your help.\nJust an update on this. There is a Beaups at Sunshine that has been very responsive. I still have not solved my issues with wireless tethering, but he has sent some links that will hopefully help me get to where I need to be.

But actually am also not fully supportive towards the explanation, every hacker in this world does that, time, money, risks ( jail ).... its not a new thing, no offense but hackers like those who does more than what you do too have gone through a rough patch to make their contributions. Most of those stuffs that we download pirated, cracks, exploits.... are free but they dont come cheap to them, some find several ways to make money, like ads.., \nmost hackers are under the verge of getting sued, they are close to the ledge of falling into one of the jails in this world, but still they do it and for free, its what hackers are for actually, you can call yourself as an engineer or something ( recalling one made an example of plumber ) but you re not, exploits are always against the makers, the company always try to patch them,\nso you guys are more or less like any hacker. I am grateful to all those hackers who made my life easier cause they were free. So in short, good job, but explanation might have been this \"we need money, we dont do free\" , all the hours.. its not an explanation, mozilla,opera,chrome,google,facebook,whatsapp... everything is free but of course they have their ways to make money, but they all started the same way and never purchased a single penny from the users.\nOf course the users here have every right and reasons to back you up, but this is the truth, whether you like it or not, so all that \"money time thing..\" is not a good sentence, and its a moto of a good hacker to provide things free. Again good work, I really need s-off but I cant cause its paid, I better wait for some other \"developer\" / a good \"hacker\" . Good luck. Just sharing my view. In every dev's or hackers page bottom they will write this \"we put so much....... so please contribute\", not just devs, companies like firefox does the same thing  . Good luck with your product, but man those words just will **** of any hacker in the world (not me , but as a friend of one I have to say or else I will be sad...).

The camera performance on the S6 is just so much better than the M9 in pretty much all aspects. You know a camera is good when you want to take more photos of things. Whereas my experience with M9's camera is the complete opposite. Even if I took the image in RAW mode, adjusting all the settings to get the correct exposure, etc, then export it to photoshop to manually touch up the images... even then... the S6's camera could take the same shot in full auto mode in a matter of seconds, and have a photo that looks better than the M9's.\nFull res images for One M9, Galaxy S6, Note 4, Nexus 6, Lumia 1520 for comparison if you guys are interested.\nBattery life between both devices wasn't that far off for me personally. The M9 lasts longer for sure, but not by a sufficient margin for me to completely write off the S6.\nSpeaker quality on the M9 is unbeatable, but I listen to music more often on earphones, and S6's wolfson DAC sounds much better to me. In fact on earphones, I couldn't stand Dolby's EQ at all. Turned them off immediately.\nIn the past HTC has a huge advantage in build quality and the premium look and feel. But Samsung has come far enough for me to be okay with the S6. But the One M9 definitely feels more premium and well built to me.\nI prefer Sense UI over TouchWiz hands down. But again, Samsung has made huge strides in optimising the UI. And I can certainly live with Touchwiz on the S6 (with more Samsung things turned off of course.)\nPerformance on both phones feels just quick, though the S6 felt faster loading apps and games, probably because of the faster memory. But not a big deal to me. Both phone performs really well.\nScreen on the S6 was much better in my opinion. Better contrast, better outdoor visibility (brighter), able to go super dim (for using at night in bed), better colours too. Pixel density is not a huge deal to me, the M9 looks just as sharp when i'm using both phone at normal handheld distance. But the M9 display's colour seemed a little off to me compared to other IPS panels. Particularly the blues and the greens. Like app icons' colours are fixed across all screens, but the Hangouts and Ingress icons' colour looks \"blown out\" on the M9.\nThe bonus on the S6 to me was the home button. I've never really liked it in the past, but this time round the button brought enough to the table for me to consider it a pro. Fingerprint sensor actually works properly now, not to mention the camera launch is really consistently quick.\nIn the past I've always preferred the HTC option. The One X, the One M7, the One M8. But this year... the S6 has my vote.\nDepending on your needs and preferences you might come to a completely different conclusion and choose the M9 of course.

If you've used any of these or similar you'll know they advise they're clearing xx amounts of available ram, deleting caches, etc which presumably speeds up and optimizes performance. \nI'm drawn in by their gui's that show what they've found and subsequently released, but I've also found I'm now using them daily (either with their app notifications or on my own), and it turns into a kind of addiction to 'clean' my device. \nSo my question: are they really necessary? I've heard that modern android OS releases are much more efficient at managing ram and clearing cache, and these tools aren't as necessary as they perhaps once were. I don't notice any definitive improvement, but my head tells me it's 'working' haha and so the cleaning addiction continues. I've also heard some devices like Samsung might potentially need these apps as they get more 'gunked up' whereas HTC does a better job utilizing resources and overall fluidity. \nWhat are your experiences with or without using these memory cleaners? Do you use them and do you see noticeable improvements? Any downsides with using them?

For those with HTC One M9s, how long did it take for yours to settle in? I got an M9 yesterday. I charged it over night so today is the first full day of use. When the screen is off, it is barely sipping battery but when the screen is on, it goes pretty quickly. \nI also thought I would share some initial thought on the M9. I have used Android, iPhone, and Windows phones regularly so this is not my first Android. I actually bought this phone because I've been using an iPhone and I just couldn't help but think the amount I am paying for this phone is not worth it. I don't just think that about iPhone. I think all flagships $600+ is a little ridiculous. So I saw a new AT&T M9 that was not an Uh Oh replacement for $299 so I thought I would give it a go. I followed the instructions on XDA and converted it to the developers edition, which removed about 20 bloatware apps. Here are my initial thoughts:\n- It ran really hot until I updated to 5.1. Ever since, it has not gotten hot. It has gotten a little bit warm at times, but not hot like it did.\n- Haven't used the camera much but in the couple times I looked at it, it seems a little slow and the quality is still lacking.\n- Build quality is really nice. I have the silver with gold around the side and it looks awesome. In comparison to my work phone, which is an HTC One M8 Windows edition, I like the look of the M9 more; however, the M9 feels noticeably thicker to me than the M8. Because of that, I prefer the feel of the M8 in my hand. \n- The screen confuses me. Sometimes I look at it and it looks really good and sometimes it looks really bad for a 1080p screen. I think the M8 screen is better. I think part of the problem is that it isn't as bright as some screens. Auto brightness works terribly so it depends on the lighting on whether it looks good or not.\n- The phone is really fast. I don't see stutter or lag. It handles things really well. The 810 might be controversial because of heating but it is a really fast chip.\n- While I prefer stock android, Sense 7 isn't that different.\n- Motion launcher (tap to wake/sleep) works every time for me when I turn on the screen but I can't get it to work to turn off the screen.\n- Best audio on a phone.\n- Love having a micro-SD slot.\nIn my opinion, I would not pay $500+ for the M9.

The M9 is still louder and clearer than most other phones at full volume. The battery life is a mix bag for me post 5.1. The standby time has really improved. However, even on power saver mode I am only getting about 4 hours screen on time max. Which is actually less than before. The problem is the phones battery life is now worse when the screen is off and I am using it an app. ie. listening to music, radio, podcast, etc. On GSAM I used to be able to get 7 hours active time which is a combination of screen on and screen off usage. Now it is closer to 6 hours and I was told it was going to go up to 8 hours active time and 5-6 hours screen on time. That is a bit disappointing but at least the battery overall in lasting a full day on moderate use and I wasn't getting that before.

If you want to take night and low light photography without using flash, you should use a tri-pod and slow shutter speed.

The low light camera and occasional heat are really the only problems with the current flagship, so address that definitely. Figure out a way to keep BoomSound, but update the look on the front. I personally like the look of the front because it's different than the solid glass fronts of 99% of phones out there. But I don't think others feel the same. The backs of their phones are still some of the best looking to me, and that includes most of the Desire phones. I think if they can update the front in an interesting way, that might help.1080 is fine with me, but apparently we're at a point in Android where 2k or 4k is gonna be a necessity on flagships I guess. \nTheir releases are kind of all over the place. They do need focus there. M9, M9 +, M8s. Why do the need all these honestly? I'd say the M series, M series+, and maybe 2 Desire (1 low, 1 mid) phones are al they need. There's too much variation all across different regions that doesn't make sense. \nFinally, I'm not sure about the rest of the world, but HTC really has no presence in the US market. What marketing they have is crappy, carriers don't care about pushing HTC either. The M7 and M8 were two of the best reviewed Android devices of the release years. Nobody really paid attention. They need some kind of big marketing push. Something new though. Not just commercials. Uh-Oh needs an even bigger push.

Starting with the marketing, they really have to do a much better job IMO ... what specifically, idk. I'm not privy to their information, nor do I get paid to be in their marketing department, but they need to do a better job.\nI also think they need to define their brand. I'll take Moto as an example. Unfortunately for HTC, they don't have a Lenovo backing them, so they don't have the cash, or the time to be as patient. That said, Moto has a clear vision and a direction. I don't think HTC needs to reinvent the wheel, but they should trim down their models to 3 or 4 per year, and consider a direct to consumer distribution strategy.\nAs far as the actual phone, I agree that they certainly need to make changes. Unfortunately my personal preference, and yours, might not equate into what's best for HTC. For instance, I don't think any phone should have anything greater than 1080p for the obvious reasons, but at least people in the US that judge a phone from the 3 bullet points on the display might think otherwise. I also think they should cater to the 4.7\" crowd and fill that hole that so many people hope to see filled by a phone with flagship specs. At the same time, make a 5.5\" version for the phablet people. And to distinguish themselves, use the biggest battery possible. They'll never compete with Samsung and LG in the camera department, but there's room for a smaller display with high end specs, and there definitely room for a flagship that'll last 24 hours. \nFinally, I'd agree with the boomsound IF they remove the black bar. I've seen so many HTC owners defend it, but the truth is, people are turned off by it. Personally I didn't look past it, and after seeing @evleaks version I had planned on getting one, but once I saw the black bar on the M9 my decision was made.\nNot sure if they even do all that, they'll even survive. I think it's gonna take an Asus or another company to take over in order for them to succeed.

That said, for the people and critics who are comparing to previous htc's and other devices, here's what I'd recommend... \nHardware - make some noticeable iterations to the design to appease the masses. I saw renders of what people thought the m9 would look like, and they do look good. Hide the amazing speakers a bit, get rid of so much bezel space, remove the HTC logo, thus increasing the screen size from 5 to perhaps 5.2. Materials are good, as are camera specs and the power and battery specs. Slight tweaks perhaps as every model should have as time moves forward. \nSoftware - improve the camera software. I don't personally have a lot of complaints, but it's apparent it's not as good as other cameras, make that happens with software as I'm sure they can. Same thing goes for battery, I'm sure they can continue tweaking that to get some improvement. \nMarketing - I haven't seen one m9 ad anywhere, which has most definitely played a role with low sales. I've seen Samsung ads, I've seen Apple ads, surprise surprise, they're the two top brands right now. Increase consumer visibility, get some funny and/or sentimental connection happening out there with the buyers. The m9 has a lot of strong points that they could really capitalize on.\nTech is a finicky and cyclical industry, they need to listen to the consumers and nimbly adjust their tactics to stay in the game.

If they don't have the budget, then they need to get creative. Look at One+ ... I'm no fan of that hideous invite system, but there's no denying they've done an extraordinary job creating brand awareness.

The Mini+ does not seem to work at all with the Peel remote that HTC has transitioned to as of midnight last night. If you try to use the HTC Sense TV app after the March 31 app update, it will not let you do anything other than download the Peel app. The HTC Sense TV app has been removed completely from Google Play. The workaround is to use an older version of the TV app. I had an older apk already saved, so I installed the slightly older TV app. This allowed me to still use the TV app on the M9 without being forced to use Peel.\nNow, I wanted to get the Mini+ to work with the M9's remote capability. On the M9, in the /system/app folder, there is a folder called HtcAccessoryService. I replaced the HtcAccessoryService.apk inside that folder with the HtcAccessoryService.apk from my M8 running Lollipop, set the correct permissions, then rebooted the phone. Then, I paired the Mini+ with the M9 and the resources from the alternate HtcAccessoryService.apk were properly loaded to the Mini+. I had a \"TV\" menu item on the Mini+ and could select and load the various remote controls I had configured within the HTC Sense TV app. The only problem is that when choosing a command to perform on the Mini+ (like Volume + or Power On/Off), nothing happened. The IR signals weren't getting sent from the Mini+ at all, even though it was acting like it was working properly. I even paired the Mini+ with the M8 to verify the Mini+ wasn't broken, and it worked perfectly.\nSo, while things are kind of working, I believe there are still some libraries or something missing from the M9 that will need to be on there for things to work how I want them to. The TV and HtcAccessoryService APKs on my M9 are the same ones on my M8 and the M8 works perfectly.

When I first purchased the M9 I did struggle with getting good photos at first, but then read on line the best settings and how to take advantage of its various features. Now I get mostly really good to stunningly good pictures.\nHere are some tips that work for me:\n1. When in normal camera mode, (so right bottom icon on the camera screen selected as CAMERA), in settings try setting the resolution to the lowest of the 3 settings if in low light or florescent light settings. It's amazing, but setting to medium or highest resolution often produces inferior pictures in normal camera mode in such environments. I believe it must be due to the mathematics behind the post-picture processing. They messed up big somehow. \nIn RAW camera mode however (RAW CAMERA selected from rightmost bottom icon), definitely do the OPPOSITE. In RAW CAMERA mode, the highest resolution is instead always the best (Just hold it really still). Which is why I'm sure it's the post processing mathematics that occurs in normal camera mode that is messed up.\n2. mostly stick to RAW CAMERA mode if any kind of non-daylight setting and you don't want the post image processing to muck things up. Even in daylight settings I found that I could see MANY more detailed leaves of a tree in RAW CAMERA mode than normal camera mode. Again, in RAW mode use highest resolution. Try out some comparisons yourself.\nDon't worry about having to manually set anything. RAW mode does not mean you have to manually set the ISO and such. You still get all of the auto-settings by default. Just any post-image processing is skipped.\n3. The M9 camera apparently has no motion stabilization. You have to hold the camera extremely still to get sharp pictures in most settings. The brighter the light the less that is true. But if any any type of low light setting, you have to brace the camera against a light pole, counter top, etc... Just holding your breath and trying to stay still even doesn't quite cut it. Instead, brace the camera against something solid in low light settings. The other day I came upon a young Western Diamondback rattlesnake while biking here in Texas. I immediately got off my bike and snapped some pictures....but I was a bit nervous obviously and couldn't quite hold steady. STILL it produced a somewhat acceptable picture. Just not good enough for my taste. If I'd had the courage (and stupidity) I would have held it on the ground close to it to get a stellar picture.\n4. HDR is awesome in scenes containing a mix of shadows AND bright objects at the same time. BUT AGAIN, BRACE THE CAMERA AGAINST SOMETHING SOLID!!! Especially in HDR mode!\n5. make sure to tap the screen on what you want to focus on just before snapping the picture. If not using HDR, then consider if you want a slower shutter speed and larger aperture to let in more light in which case tap something dark, or if wanting a quicker shutter speed in which case tap something bright.

Just in time for the early April time frame.\nThis is all very good news, and it\u2019s why you should never freak out about problems before a device is available in stores.

Remember when HTC didn't want to take part in the megapixel race and instead, focused on a 2-micron pixel size for the best possible low-light photos? \nWell, with HTC using a 20-megapixel Toshiba T4KA7 sensor on the M9 as the main camera, is the UltraPixel still a good idea?\nMe? Sounds crazy but.....yes, I still think it was a great idea, in theory.\nLet me explain. Phone camera sensors are typically very small, and cramming tons of pixels inside one can have some issues, especially in low-light, where individual pixels are too small to receive sufficient light. This can be mitigated by using a larger sensor, adding OIS and a wider aperture, like on the LG G4. However, HTC didn't want to join the MP race and instead, wanted to attempt to innovate and create a camera sensor that provides good low-light shots but also having pretty decent daylight shots. Hence, why the UltraPixel was born.\nA great concept in theory, but why is it frowned upon? 4 megapixels.\nHTC chose the 4MP sensor resolution because on the size of the sensor they were using, 4MP gave them pixels the size of 2 microns. Of course, in theory, 4MP would be adequate since it's bigger than what people share online, which is what most people do with their smartphone's photos anyway. However, the execution kinda fell flat as the dynamic range isn't as high as we would hope and due to the sensor's Bayer layout, effective resolution was actually at a paltry 2MP instead of 4MP, which explains the lack of detail in daylight shots, although it's still detailed enough for pictures of cats for your Instagram collection.\nOkay, so if I think that their execution fell flat on its face, why do I still think it's a great idea? Because when done right, it can produce great results.\nThe iPhone 6's camera is pretty much the descendant of the UltraPixel. Instead of favoring large pixel counts, it focuses on individual pixel size with 1.5-micron pixels on an 8MP custom Sony Exmor RS sensor. The higher resolution means that daylight shots are more detailed, while having a pixel-size large enough so that low-light shots look decent. If anything, the pictures on Apple's \"Shot on iPhone 6\" gallery seem to be a pretty good look at the capabilities of its camera.\nSimply put, the UltraPixel is a great idea, and if done right, can produce pretty good results. But I think HTC's execution could have been a little bit better, but since the M8's camera wasn't a complete potato, it wasn't a terrible camera. It was actually decent. Though, considering HTC's falling fortunes, my expectations are probably too high.", "time": "08-12-2015 09:06 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4603000", "text": "Let me preface this by saying I don't know much about photography, but I think they were on the right track with the ultrpixel idea. I agree if they could have stayed with it and learned from their mistakes, increased the megapixel so cropping didn't look so bad, and used more advanced sensors it could've worked to their advantage in the long run. I also really miss the duo camera set up on my M9. Sure alot of what it did was gimmicky, but my favorite bit of the duo camera was focusing after the fact. If I didn't quite get the focus right, I knew I could always get something a little better after the shot was saved. Their was also some cool editing options using the duo set up.\nI'm kinda wondering if they had to scrap the ultrapixel because they needed to focus their resources elsewhere.

The Samsung S6 Edge is an incredible device and has been turning people's heads, it's the only phone to turn my head (I don't think I will be going for it though), so naturally people will compare the 2 flagships. But HTC have released absolutely solid phones for the last couple of years with millions of happy users, so you don't need to worry too much about cosmetic changes, and you can feel confident that you will get a top end device. I wish I can say the same for Samsung and their flagships, my previous experiences with their flagships (The Note 4 being the latest) have left me slightly worried on whether my user experience will be on par with a HTC Flagship.

I received my M9 on 3/30 around 10am EST. The device is fantastic in hand. The feel is even better than the M8 and it feels more solid. The UI has no stutter to speak of. Connectivity and call quality are both fantastic. Battery life has been enough to get me through the day. I took it off the charger at 6am and still have 10% at the time of typing this. 4 1/2 SOT.\nThe screen took me about 3 whole hours to get accustomed to, simply because I had the M8 right next to it. Now, I actually prefer the M9 screen to the M8. I never realized how warm the tone was on the M8. The M9 definitely has the better screen, it gets brighter than the M8 and goes darker than the M8 for night time usage. I found the power button placement to be a nuisance at first but have become accustomed to it. The sound quality, both from headphones/aux cable in the car and the speaker is better than the M8. I went to youtube and tested them with some Dolby videos and I was amazed at what the M9 can do.\nThe camera......ugh.......The camera! It's not that bad. The third party apps I have been using(VSCO cam and Perfectly clear) do a better job than the stock camera app. I also do a lot of post processing with my pics, mostly due to the fact that I have three little boys that I take a crap-ton of pictures of and share them to Facebook. Any ways the images below are some shots with a Canon DSLR(my wife's baby) of the the M8 and M9 screens next to each other and then some random shots I've taken with the camera(stock app, auto and no edits).

The architecture of their devices goes from display -> battery -> other components. The only restrictions would be the threshold of the dimensions of the device that are finalized.

In the past they have modified the original design to make upgrades.

So the profile became thicker due to the increased battery capacity, yet they kept everything else intact.\nTheir ability to include OIS hinges on finding a supplier and the infinite wisdom of the bean counters to cut costs.

I had used GPS and that of course kills the battery. I also made the mistake to compare the M9 to the battery life of the iPhone6 Plus, a phablet. This was an unfair comparison. \nThe M8 has better battery life and that is a regression people don't like to accept that easily (myself included).\nThe other four points that the media have been talking about are also important and I would like to comment on them. \nThe camera is not on par with the iPhone, but it's actually much better than the M8, especially in normal daylight. In low light the default settings are bad. The device uses 1600 ISO level and that of course makes everything noisy. If you decide to play with the settings you will be able to take good pictures. Having said that, HTC should provide a better camera experience. I believe they should continue the Ultrapixel route and double the resolution. That would give them a unique advantage. \nOf course we don't know why they didn't do that. \nHTC needs to understand that the camera experience is important to most people and their flagship device should have a great camera. The current camera is ok, but nothing more than that. If you can live with it and are prepared to customize its settings then you will be able to take great pictures. \nThe heat: The M9 gets warmer than the M8 but it's not annoying. HTC should try though to further optimize the CPU behaviour. I would say that the whole issue is actually blown out of any proportion. \nThe Design is great. HTC still has the best design out there but I understand people who complain. People want something new and don't want iterations. I applaude HTC for iterating! If they weren't able to come up with a.different design then they shouldn't change anything just for changes sake. The M9 is actually better built than the M8.\nThe display: It's at least as good as the one found in the M8 but using cooler colors (which I prefer). I would like to see HTC putting the best display in their flagship device. The display is still very good but HTC should do better. \nSo where all these leave us? The M9 is an excellent phone like the M8 is, with flaws. It has still great software, much better than Touchwiz. I love Blinkfeed and the way it keeps me always up to date. I still haven't found a better news aggregator and for me this is a major differentiator. \nThe speakers are better than on the M8. I love them. \nSo should you upgrade from an M8 to the M9? Probably not, unless you want to have the latest. \nIf you are coming from a different device and you can live with the camera shortcomings, then the M9 is a great choice. But isn't that what we said last year about the M8? \nI am keeping my M9, because I love the design, the speakers, Blinkfeed and the new Sense theming engine. I also want to have the latest device. \nThe M9 will not sell as well the M8 did as long as HTC doesn't improve its marketing and the M9 camera..\nHTC should show to the world what the strengths of the M9 are. People talk about the S6, which blatantly copied Apple (again), and nobody is talking about the One series, who offer a unique design, amazingly beautiful.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "04-01-2015 03:47 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4322533", "text": "I don't really know anything about photography, but I'd like to take better low-light shots.

It was an upgrade for me from an M7 (also Tmobile). I had decided not to upgrade to the M8 when it came out because I wasn't very thrilled with the new, rounder design so when the M9 came out I was very happy to see that they had gone back to a slightly more angular shape. To me it looks like a cross between and M7 and an M8. I read a review where the author mentioned that this phone doesn't photograph well. I agree, it looks so much better in person.\nDesign Pros:\n- The case is now all aluminum as opposed to the M7 which had exposed plasticy ends.\n- The contrast between the silver and gold metal is very attractive and the subtle brush marks on the metal add to the luxurious feel of the phone.\n- While I didn't like the side power button at first I've gotten used to it and am starting to like it.\n- Compared to the M7 it has a big, beautiful display\nDesign Cons:\n- I'm still not loving the speaker bars on either end of the face. I know it's part of the signature look, but I feel like they could have made them a bit more sleek.\nAs far as the software changes go, I am pretty much blown away. I was running Lollipop on my M7 so I wasn't expecting as huge of a difference as I was presented with. I love being able to customize my phone and HTC has clearly stepped up in this area. The amount of sounds, fonts, colors, etc. they've preloaded on the phone is almost overwhelming on it's own, but then add themes.htc.com to the mix and I don't think I'll ever run out of ways to change up the look of my phone.\nSoftware Pros:\n- Customization!\nSoftware Cons:\n- Blinkfeed. I had it disabled on my M7 but figured I'd give it a go on the new phone, but decided to disable it again. Great concept but I just don't care for the execution. I'd rather use flipboard, feedly or something similar for news and Google Now fills in the rest of the gaps.\n- I really appreciated how easy they made it to move all of my data from the old phone to the new. I'm sure other phones have this too, but I was really impressed with how simple they made it.\nAs for battery life, I haven't run any tests yet because I'm not using it \"normally\" yet. It's still an awesome new toy and I can't put it down so I'm draining the battery much faster than I usually would. I can say that even with heavy use it is lasting much longer without needing a charge than my M7 did. In all fairness though, my M7 was two years old.\nThe camera is another area I can't really speak too. It's not a super important feature to me so I haven't tested it out much.\nBottom line is, I'm extremely happy with my purchase and glad I upgraded.", "time": "04-01-2015 04:49 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4322578", "text": "This is from my M8 running custom rom and custom kernel.\nFrom my fingers to you on the M8, M9 or the Chromebook!", "time": "04-01-2015 05:53 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4322698", "text": "Wow.

Only to check to see if it worked. Also used it to do a check deposit, which actually worked better than the M7. Frankly I don't care whether or not the camera is great or not. I carry a small point and shoot around with me to places I'd be likely to want to snap pictures. The 'real' camera works much better than any cell phone camera will with current technology. The things that I use the cell phone to snap are things that I don't need great quality photos do.\nPerformance - Everything runs super smoothly. Haven't experienced any lag. The service gets warm when running certain apps, but honestly my M7 ran even warmer, so no complaints there either. \nCall Quality - Excellent. A little different sound than the M7, but not in a good our bad way. \nData Connectivity - Nice to finally experience a tri-band device. At first it would disconnect LTE occasionally, but after doing a PRL update and a profile update, I don't seem to have any issues.\nMisc - Not sure I like the power button on the side, but with double tap to wake the screen I don't mind too much. Phone feels solid, like the M7. I got the hold on silver one, looks stunning, but put a case on it right away. \nOverall I am pleased with my new phone less than a week in. Definitely an upgrade from the M7.

From all the posts and reviews, the general consensus is that the M9 was an incremental upgrade. And i'm OK with that. HTC attempted to address complaints from previous M phones and they did just that. \nNow whether people like the position of the power button, or the slightly modified edge that is supposed to improve grip, it's up to the consumer. No-one will consider a phone to be perfect nor there is such thing as the perfect phone.\nNow coming from an M8 HK edition, i currently don't see the need to upgrade to the M9, nor S6 for that matter. I'm happy with my current phone and i will wait and see what is in store for 2016.\nAs far as the M9 camera is concerned, I truly believe that it has more potential than the M8's ultrapixel camera. It's just that HTC did not optimize hardware and software when it comes to the camera department. We've seen big improvements by adjusting certain settings manually, and at the end of the day, it should perform better as we now have 5 times the pixel count. Yeah... People complained about the 4 'ultrapixel' setup, and now we have 20MP. It just needs to be optimized, which HTC hasn't done so yet.\nI heard a quote from some guy once that said \"It's not having what you want, but wanting what you have\".....\nDo I want the M9.. Sure, why not. It is improved in many ways over the M8. Do I really need it... well, to each their own.\nWould I recommend this phone to others who are upgrading (say from M7, or other older phone)?. Yes. BUT it depends on what they want out of their smartphone. Picture quality? I will probably go with S6, Note 4, other. Everything else? I like the M9.", "time": "04-07-2015 12:15 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4344768", "text": "I got my gunmetal M9 in today, so I thought I'd give my initial impressions. I'll probably repost after a few days when I have more time with it as well.\nThe good:\nIt's a beautiful phone, and the pics/videos don't do it justice. On the gunmetal version the sides are a shiny black, while the rest of the device is a darker gunmetal than the M8. The back looks really elegant, while the front has a more industrial look. I would say the back looks better than my iPhone 6, but the front isn't as elegant as the iPhone. I still think the front looks good though.\nIt feels great in the hand. It has weight, but it's not too heavy or wide. I don't so much worry about the height of a phone. Width is more important to me. \nI have no problems with the display as some reviewers mentioned. It's a little cooler, but not super noticeable sitting next to my iPhone. I watched the Avengers trailer, and the only time I really noticed a big difference is when the screen is using all primary colors. I'd imagine animated videos might not look so good, but I haven't tried that yet. Skin tones are a little cooler, but don't look unnatural.\nThe sound coming from the speakers is as impressive as ever. It may be a little quieter, but the quality of sound more than makes up for it. The theater mode sounds amazing. The music mode is a little louder (about the volume I remember from the M8), but loses some of the clarity and punch of theater mode.\nThe interface is great. If you liked Sense in the past, you'll like the newest version. I removed Sense Home because I didn't think it would be useful, and I prefer a less cluttered display. I may put it back to test on one of the secondary screens just to give it a shot later. The themes are cool, but I haven't really delved too deeply into making my own (I've only had the phone since this afternoon).\nEverything is really smooth with no choppiness or stuttering that I've seen so far. \nThe bad:\nIt drives me a little crazy that I can't seem to find a way to turn on a notification sound for incoming email using the stock mail app. There's probably a setting to do so, but I haven't found it yet.\nAlso I can't seem to find a way to set custom SMS notification alerts for different people. I use this a lot. It really bothers me, probably more than it should.\nThis is with all of Android, but I still find iOS apps to look a little better, and in some cases more functional than their Android counterparts. Not HTC's fault though.\nThe indifferent:\nI don't find the sleep/wake button to be as uncomfortable to press as some reviewers, but it is a little low for my taste. I do push the volume down button sometimes instead of hitting the sleep/wake. I may or may not get used to it over time. \nI use a MBP as my computer, and I find transferring things back and forth to be cumbersome. It's not really a dealbreaker, but I do wish there was a smoother alternative.\nI prefer the screen to light up when I get incoming text messages. I know I had an app on my M8 that handled that, but I've forgotten what it's called. It's a little disappointing it doesn't have the option out of the box though.\nNot tested:\nThe two biggest gripes forum members and reviewers have seem to be the battery life and camera. Unfortunately I just haven't had the phone long enough to make a decision either way. While setting up I didn't even have a sim in it, and kept it charging. Since then It's been charging on and off while I moved photos, music, ringtones, etc. from my computer to the phone. I did notice one possibly bad omen for battery life. While testing the video between the iPhone 6 and M9 I turned brightness to 100% and auto-brightness off on both devices. They both started almost fully charged. The iPhone's battery percentage didn't change, but the M9 went down 3%. I've only taken 3 photos. All on auto and in my bedroom after work. They weren't good, but not bad either. Just kinda somewhere inbetween. Hopefully my next off day I'll be able to take both phones out and about with me to take some photos to compare.\nSorry if I rambled.

I have two M8, and the M9 is coated with something that makes it less slippery. I like the look of the edge where the back and sides meet, but not the feel so much. Seems like there should have been a very small chamfer on that edge. The rest of the phone looks great, and I'm sure it will get stares like the M4, 7, and 8.\nBeing an engineer and tester, I would like to comment on the battery, warmth, and audio. Battery: It is entirely correct that lithium polymer power cells do not need to be conditioned. Their life span is determined by the total voltage flowing through them, not the number of times they get charged. That being said, the software on these phones does need a few cycles to learn usage and optimization patterns. This is nothing new, and even cars will lose some economy when the PCM is reset until they learn driving habits and conditions. Chrysler has an official \"Quick Learn\" procedure for speeding up the process of the transmission getting back to optimum performance. I experienced this with the recent Lolipop update as well, and the battery life was iffy the first few cycles, but is now pretty good. I will NOT be quite the same on the M9 because it is using a more powerful processor, but I would expect that battery life will become better by the end of the week for most users.\nHeat: This is a metal backed phone with eight processor cores. Aluminium has a high thermal conductivity rate thanks to the cubic grain structure. In laymen's terms, it means that it carries heat away from the insides efficiently. You will feel it much more than if the back was an insulator like plastic or leather or glass. My M4 (HTC One mini) would reach 113 degrees F while playing Leo's Fortune, so the 111 degrees F (44C) mentioned earlier is not a big deal.\nSound: The speakers on the M9 are just as good as the M8. What is different is the wider frequency response of the M9. Losing a couple DB of volume is expected when you enhance the quality, as the accoustic energy is distributed across a broader spectrum. I say this as a patented speaker designer. \nLastly, I've never had to reset or reload an HTC phone because of lag. I keep the basic powersave mode on all the time because the M8 is so stupid fast and smooth, even when the CPU is held back. The M9 is even faster. Now, there are OTHER phones that I've had get slow over time, and this is a problem that my co-workers and my son experience. HTC, however, has that part figured out, and I'd expect the M9 to keep it's speed just like the previous One's \nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "04-12-2015 01:43 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4350644", "text": "Agreed.

On the other hand, we now have very fast, 64 bit - 8 core processors which will generate more heat, and of course, drain the battery faster. Sometimes I think why we really need such powerful processors on smartphones. Looking at my M8 performance next to the M9, there is not that \"huge\" difference in every day use (only on benchmarks and demanding games), but for the everyday use, I would rather have a toned down processor if it will favor battery live.

For example, if I start a speed test, it displays \"testing ping\" for about 30 seconds. Finally the ping goes through and the test begins. The download speed tests OK (20 mbps) but the upload tapers off through the duration of the test, starting at 10 mbps and tapering off to 1-2 mbps by the end. If I turn wifi off and run a test on LTE, it works flawlessly.\nAny tips?\nThanks...Tom", "time": "07-17-2015 07:48 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4559282", "text": "Go in settings>wifi>tap three dots, then advanced.Check to see what your wi-fi frequency band is on.", "time": "07-17-2015 02:50 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4558614", "text": "I have the same issue with my M9, on all networks though. \nThere is a setting to turn off data during long periods of time of no use.\nI have that turned off and i see no difference.\nSent from my M9 using Tapatalk", "time": "07-17-2015 08:16 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Why isn't my Media (Photos, Music) and Messaging not found on my HTC One M9?", "thread": [{"postID": "post4553724", "text": "Bought my HTC one M9 today and after setting everything up I've realised that I can't find my gallery album or music and even Messaging anywhere ..

The m9 would constantly top 102 degrees especially when using the camera.\nPoor lowlight camera - This has been said many times, but i'll say this again. The lowlight performance of the camera is HORRIBLE!! ( Even after recommended adjustments from XDA)\nPoor Battery - The battery drain is significant. GSM Battery continued to give an average of 3.5 hours of screen on which is not up to standards.\nBattery while taking pictures - I would literally drop 3 percent in battery life with just 8 pictures taken in a row and even more drain when in low light. Seems like the processor goes into overdrive when the camera is launched thus causing rapid battery drain.\nEverything else about the device was beautiful. Design, Screen and UI was boss. \nIn the end I think im going to hold off on the newest flagships of 2015 and wait to see what others are offering.

They had a good low-light camera on their phones before, and basically everybody except for me and five other people told them they didn't want it. \nI don't think the heat is much of an issue, as it falls in line with other devices I've tested (I'm an engineer). The problem is that HTC did a good job in getting heat to transfer from the internals to the back where it could be dissipated. This is great for the internal components, but odd for the user experience because it will always feel warmer than other devices. If you ran an S6 hard so the internal processor reached 102 degrees (and it does), the back would feel cool because it's holding the heat inside due to glass being a thermal insulator, not a conductor. By the way, aluminium is good at thermal conductance due to the cubic grain structure. So if you did have an S6 (which I also like, by the way), and an M9 with the same internal temperatures, pretty much everybody would say the S6 feels cool and the M9 feels hot. The plus side is that the M9 sheds heat at an amazing rate. I don't have the exact results in front of me right now, but it's something like a 30 degree drop in 90 seconds with a 50 degree airflow over the back.", "time": "04-22-2015 07:29 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4379337", "text": "My m9 works fine better than iPhone and ditched my Sony Xperia z3 HTC is the best out there so quit sniffling\nPosted via the Android Central App HTC M9", "time": "04-22-2015 05:41 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4403254", "text": "Glad I seen this thread.

There are at least 30 threads in the S6 forums related to battery life. I honestly think I'm downplaying the 30.\nAlso, I think there are more M9 users that are previous HTC owners. So a lot of the little things don't get threads because a good many users on this forum know about settings/optimizations already. \nI've noticed a quantity over quality on some of the other threads as well.

(Actually, EPROMs came out even earlier, but they're not the same kind of technology, so I'm trying to compare at least fruit with fruit, not with cars.) And I've always bought only SanDisk. In a few decades, the only \"bad\" card I've ever had was a microSD card that I cracked in half (and klutziness isn't covered by the warranty). My 256MB (not GB - MB) card still works LONG after the warranty ran out.\nWhen Samsung messed up the 4.3 update and it started eating cards, who came out with the fix? Not Samsung - SanDisk modified their cards to work with the bad update.\nYou want at least a U1 (Class 10 - same thing in a different numbering system) card, but if you're planning on recording 4k video you want a U3 card (U1 isn't fast enough for 4k). There's no \"Class 30\" card - cards are now rated by the U number.\nRemember also - the speeds the cards are rated at are burst speeds - you can write a sector really fast, but if you try to write 2GB at once, it's going to be a lot slower. (It's like putting letters into pigeon holes - it may take 1 second to put one in, but getting the next letter, reading it, scanning for the correct pigeon hole and putting the letter in it takes longer. Not a perfect analogy, but something like that.) As long as the card is truly rated - and Samsung and SanDisk cards are - a U3 card is fast enough for 4k video. (I prefer dealing with SanDisk - I've had the pleasure of having had to, and considering how some companies make you jump through hoops just to get to a real person, dealing with SanDisk is a pleasure.)\nWhatever you buy, install SD Insight and run it when the card is in the phone. If you see the card was made in 1970, or it's a 4GB card, you have a counterfeit card. They can duplicate the packaging and the printing on the card so even a microscope can't tell it from the real thing - but when SD Insight sees a 4GB memory chip inside the card, it's all over.

To be honest, I wouldn't worry too much about it. \"Junk cleaner\" apps might be more trouble than they're worth, since they often claim to be \"memory booster\" apps as well, and do things that are counterproductive to how Android is designed to work. Other kinds of junk cleaners might actually do things you don't want, like automatically uninstall apps you haven't used in a month or so (without warning you).\nIt's true that sometimes apps may leave behind some data directories after uninstallation. I periodically look through the directories using a file manager app and delete any directory that clearly belongs to an uninstalled app. But this often doesn't account for much storage anyway.\nClearing app caches can be done without a 3rd party app--just go to Settings>Storage, tap Cached Data, then agree to clear the caches.

Another thread asking whether upgrading to the latest device is worthwhile.\nHere is the twist though, I am currently cruising on the HTC One M7.\nHow did I hold onto a phone for 2 years? *gasps and shock fill the room*.\nTo be honest it was easy. With the front facing speakers, Sense UI which just makes sense and a nice 4.7 form factor it was easy and still is.\nHowever, for the last 3 months my camera has come down with the purple hue disease. A camera is not the most important feature of a smartphone to me but it is up there in the top 10.\nIf it wasn't for this purple hue, I would not be looking at a new phone at all as it still runs like the first day out of the box *hugs sense* with no lag in the UI.\nThere are just a few things I would like to know from other HTC enthusiasts before considering the M9.\n1. Are the issues with the Snapdragon 810 over heating is true?\n2. Are the front facing speakers still as loud and crisp as the M7?\n3. Do you see any stutter or lag in the Sense UI?\n4. Other than themes, has Sense really seen that much more of an improvement over 2 years?\n5. Handling a 4.7 inch form factor phone and going to a 5 inch is it really that much bigger?\nIf anyone can enlighten me, I would be truly thankful.\nIn the end, I am really just wondering if I can hold of on the M9 and just wait for the M10. By that time the snap dragon processors should be blitzing again and the devices wont be running that troublesome lollipop version.", "time": "06-19-2015 08:26 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4506453", "text": "I came from where you are so I understand the question. I also think it's funny that like me your purple issue developed late in the life of your M7. If what everyone was complaining about was what I was seeing I have to ask myself how was there any question about could this be normal like I was seeing early on in the discussions. Anyway to your questions...\n1. I have noticed the phone getting a little hot. Once I was running an app that required some to complete and found that not only did the phone heat up but it stopped taking a charge. Once I unplugged it and allowed it to cool down it seemed fine but that was kind of scary. So far it hasn't appeared to be anything device threatening, but you may want to wait for other opinions on that.\n2. Actually they are slightly louder, but still not pre speaker blown scare loud like the M7 had been. Personally I would just go into a store and compare them side by side, because you'll want to put your hands on one before committing anyway.\n3. No lag at all. It is so much smoother and faster than the M7, which I never noticed any issue with when I owned it, but going back now OMG, there is such a difference.\n4. I would have to say not really. You will probably notice some of the changes, but most of the changes are similar to the ones you probably got recently with the Sense update. Honestly between the two, the Sense update for the M7 and the Sense version that came on the device I haven't noticed much. Maybe a few more themes for the updated version, or at least not the warning that a theme may not perform as well on an older version.\n5. Again you are going to want to put one in your hand for this. For me I barely notice any difference, that could be because the M9 is thinner, I have big hands anyway, any number of things, but it really didn't seem to be much of an issue for me. What I noticed more than the size change was the weight change. The M9 is so much lighter. I barely know i have it in my pocket.

I was fortunate that my wife upgraded to an M9 first and I waited. I fiddled with her phone a lot, and it was ok. I had issues with my One Max battery starting to lose its charge since I had at for over two years. So I decided to wait and picked up an LG G4. This phone is quite a bit better than my wife's M9 and leagues better than my One Max. They get almost the same battery time about 4 1/2 to 5 hours SOT with the edge going to the M9. Functionality and speed are pretty much on par with each other with a slight edge to the G4 even with LG's UX I imo. The interchangeable battery is where it was the deal breaker for me. I am a power user and I'm on my phone all day. The fact I can switch it out and go from zero to a hundred percent in a minute is awesome. I also don't have to worry about sending in my phone just to replace the battery. My One Max had easy all day battery life when I first got it. So does the M9. In two years, my One Max had to be on the charger by 3 pm. The M9 will probably go that route too after a couple of years unless I send the phone into HTC to replace the battery paying anywhere from $45 to $100 plus not having a phone when I do ship it out.\nI am interested in what the M10 brings though.

I like to point and shoot which I had no issues with on the GS3 & GS4. The M9 as a phone is a solid performer....no doubt there. Good quality, sharp looks, great performance and crystal clear sound. However we are talking about the camera. No OIS on M9 was shocking to me. The camera is essential to me. I don't want to be concerned about photo quality every single time I take a picture. Yet, that's been the case for the past few weeks. Some pictures are good and others are terrible. My friend has the S6 and the pictures and video are much better than my M9. So from my experience, the M9 was a decent bump from the M8 but a complete fail on a 20 Megapixel camera. To add insult to injury, HTC support was no help. They told me to send it in for service. I also sent them a support email Wednesday of last week and have not received a reply. Clearly they know this is an issue as they rolled out a software update a few weeks back that improved the camera slightly. I'm officially tapping out on HTC until some major changes take place on future models. That is if they can stay in the game. Funny article I read about the 24k Gold M9.

Customer Support has slipped a bit - my few calls over past years were answered by knowledgeable, helpful staff; but my last call was answered by somebody hard to understand who knew only her name without help from a supervisor - ah, progress! Like the M8, which I skipped because of the damned speakers, the M9 has only two real problems so far: \n1. It lacks a lock screen ID (Owner name and contact), requiring that I add text to my lock screen photo. It should have a text overlay to show that, the way phones did in the good ol' days.\n2. It has those big speakers that make the phone unnecessarily long. How many of you actually listen to Beethoven's 5th Symphony or watch Star Wars on your cell phone - without earphones? The little mono speaker on the back of my DNA did the job nicely. In fairness, it is impressive that they added mega-speakers and kept the M9 only very slightly longer than the DNA, but I'd much rather lose another quarter inch of length.\nOn the plus side. HTC did some great things with the M9 (again vs the DNA). The side power button is a great move and much easier to use after you get used to it. The Interruptions utility is a good idea, though I am still getting used to it. The long-press symbols and numbers added to the keyboard are a real time-saver. I have seen much discussion about the camera, which is not an issue for me. I travel with a camera for \"real\" pictures and use my phone for casual shots, shopping (taking a pic of the 27 weird fluorescent bulbs that we now need), scanning short documents, golf videos of friends' swing idiosyncrasies, and the like. It works just fine for all of those things. The voice to text processing is awesome, too. I now dictate notes, shopping lists and text messages. \nThere are two other issues that may not be HTC issues: SIM card swaps and non-removable crapware (e.g., Cookie Jam). I travelled to Europe with the M9 and the local SIM cards worked fine, with a couple of minor squawks: calls said they were coming from/going to random countries and the tethering/hot spot did not work in London (ee, formerly Orange and T-Mobile), nor Amsterdam (Vodaphone). The problem arose when I returned home and had to visit a Verizon store for a new SIM card. VZW says that the problem is Android phones do not \"reprovision\" themselves automatically; meaning that once you add a non-VZW SIM card to your phone, your old VZW SIM card is bricked. I had the very same issue with my DNA, also Verizon. My wife's iPhone 5 had none of those problems; it tethered, hot-spotted and reprovisioned itself when I reinstalled her VZW SIM card. With the dearth of public phones, it is terrily inconvenient to come home and find you cell phone useless. VZW did agree to send me a spare SIM card so that I can at least get reprovisioned on the fly, well, after-the-fly.", "time": "06-09-2015 05:06 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4482944", "text": "Move the power button up on the right side and move the volume buttons to the left like Apple and Samsung.

Im not a power user nor do most of the 'smart' features of a Phone go on my top 3 list. I want a phone that works. No missed calls or text.. paramount.\nI had the G1 a week after launch ( loved it ). Running with T-mo with the 4g slide next..then z1 experia and finally the z3. Coming from the z line will give you an indication where im coming from.\nThe Z3 is a great unit. Superb pics and simple UI. But the reception was poor. I missed calls and texts way too often and keyboard was unresponsive after the proximity sensor was active. The Z1 never had this problem..so its not T-mo or the location. I traded it in for another Z3 and same problem. So It was time to switch brands. M9, Apple 6 or the S6 was recommended as having the best reception. The HTC felt the best in my large hands..so M9 won.\nThe M9 has better reception and call quality over my Z3. \nI can hold it with my Hand instead of my finger tips. ( also using tech21 thin body protector )\nThe camera seems quicker..but the pictures are not as high quality as the Z3.\nSpeakers blow the dual front of the z3 out of the water ( but Z3 can be in the water ).\nThe UI is snazzier but really not that important to me ( its fine now that I have it laid out for me ).\nThe data exchanges seems quicker.\nBattery falls way short of the Z3. I could go almost 5 days without charging with light use with Z3. I will have to see how it goes after a week or so of charging the M9 ( may get better after using the battery ).\nAll and all I think the M9 is a great Phone. The extra 'smart' amenities work just fine and while the battery is my only hesitation, I just have to treat it like all the other phones Ive had ( plug it in a charger when I go to sleep ). \nHonestly I would probably Try the S6..however I think im done holding my cell with my fingertips. How the M9 just fits my Hand is really the reason Im not even going to try another unit. Sure other phones might be just a tad better at resolution..or HP..or whatever.

This links in with the S6 because the M9 costs the same as the S6 but the S6 offers much more - better processor(?), class-leading camera, class-leading screen, Samsung Pay etc. The screen and camera will sway a lot of people. Whereas the M9 has a more fluid UI and better speakers. I think it looks more premium too but that's subjective. I don't consider the M9 good value for money though.

For example:When I open the group text, there's a bubble that says \"Converting to MMS message\" every time. This happens even if I just backed out of the message and re-entered it.Every time I send a message, a loading icon pops up in the middle of the screen. After the loading icon goes away, the message that I sent has another icon inside of it that stays there for a few seconds. Eventually, that icon goes away tooSome of the messages that are sent to me by my friends come through as individual texts with a download link. If I follow the download link, it appears in the group textEDIT: Scrolling through the group message is extremely choppy. Everything else on this phone has been smooth, this is the only thing I've noticed that doesn't load well\nIs this typical behavior? Is this something to do with Android or the M9 in particular? I've never run into any issues like this before.\nThanks for any help!", "time": "05-17-2015 09:51 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4432532", "text": "Group text messages send as mms do this is normal.

It might be a good idea for people to say what network they are on to further isolate carrier specific issues or what to expect from a certain carrier. Aside from that, the more screen shots get that posted the more you can find an average by throwing out the outliers that are too high and too low. Right now from looking on this site and XDA I find the average is about 4-5 hours on screen time with 14-16 hours total. Not great but not terrible.

I'm sure it can be better, but I'm not complaining considering it outlasts my other phones. I have to point out though, that I'm not compulsive enough to upgrade every few months like some people here -- I have only ever owned three Smartphones: the Droid Incredible, the Droid DNA, and now the HTC One M9. I likely won't have another until the M11 or whatever it will be in two more years when I can upgrade again.\nFor reference, I am on Verizon, and as such, my M9 is not rooted, not S-OFF, and running stock rom and everything.\nInitially, the battery life honestly sucked. In standby / idle, it was draining at a rate of about 3-4% per hour, which felt pretty huge. GSAM reported some heavy wakelocking, but without root, I couldn't really drill any deeper. With that, I started disabling stuff in a semi-blind manner; mostly by disabling Verizon apps, Facebook, Blinkfeed, Amazon, display gestures, some Location services, etc. since I don't use any of that stuff. None of these really helped, although since I don't use them, I'm not going to turn them back on anyway.\nHowever, I then decided to disable the wifi entirely, and it's been great ever since.\nFor some reason, with wifi active, it would keep my M9 wakelocked about 60-65% of the time -- the phone spent 30-40 minutes of every hour held awake. Once wifi was disabled, my phone now spends an average of 1 (one -- a single!) minute per hour held awake. This has dropped my phone's idle battery drain from 3-4% to somewhere around 0.3-0.5% per hour. I also have the phone set to shut off data after \"long periods of inactivity,\" whatever that means. In effect, during the 8-10 hours overnight it only loses between 3-4% battery.\nHaving \"fixed\" that issue (and I can afford to leave wifi off since I currently still have the grandfathered unlimited data) I decided to run a variety of tests to gauge what my best and worst case usage scenarios would be like. The only other setting of note is that I have locked the brightness at as close to 140 cd/m2 as I could manage, with auto brightness disabled. It's a bit tough since that bar is hard to move precisely, but I measured 146 cd/m2 at the point where I left it for all the tests (at maybe just a hair over 50%.) This is brighter than I'd normally leave it, but I figured I'd first test with a brightness setting close to my desktop monitor's.\nWith that said, I ran three tests - a best case 'light' scenario, and worst case 'heavy' scenario, and a worst case 'normal usage' scenario.\nNote also that at no point do I enable the Extreme Power Saver mode (regular Power Saver is not available on Verizon models, so that's also not in use. However \"Sleep Mode\" is enabled.)First up is the best case 'light' usage scenario:\nIn this scenario, I charged the phone up to 100%, and then left it on my desk. I checked it occasionally for messages and such, but otherwise I largely avoided doing anything with it. This represents the best case for the battery, as it simply wasn't used very much (potentially if I'm ever in a position where I cannot charge for a long period of time, I will know that I have this long before I'm unable to contact people, assuming decent network signals.)Result: an astounding 151 hours of idle time before it hit 1% (and at this rate, that 1% would probably still last another hour or so.) Over 6 days of standby time is pretty amazing to me.Second test is the worst case 'heavy' usage scenario:\nThis test was largely a test of essentially giving the phone very little rest.\nOnce off the charger, I put it through the following:2 hours of music playback via headphones (screen off; local files)1 full HD movie, including end credits via speakers, ~85% volume and 'Theater' mode (The Transformers, streamed via Google Play Movies)1 hour of music playback via speakers, maximum volume and 'Music' mode (screen off; local files)1 hour of 'gaming' with sound via speakers, ~70% volume (running around in the RPG 'Silver Nornir')3-4 hours of idle to allow time to cool down (and for me to eat)Final 12% of the battery was spent streaming a Youtube playlist repeatedly with sound via speakers, maximum volume and 'Music' mode (failed to time this, but I think it was about 40-50 minutes before it hit 1% left)Result: All in all, I feel it was hit pretty hard, and it clocked in at just under 4 hours of screen-on time. However, I noted that the bulk of the power was actually NOT the screen, but rather the LTE radio. Well, then, this calls for my next test.\nI should also note that the phone, while warm, was not actually all that 'hot.' It also cools down very quickly, considering the entire phone is basically a giant heatsink.Test three: My worst case 'heavy' con usage scenario:\nFor this test, I simulated one of my \"convention / trip\" days, with heavier-than-expected usage. The goal is to stress the screen time, without putting too much load on the LTE network (I don't normally stream copious amounts of stuff anyway.)\nOnce off the charger, the phone was set to 3 hours of music playback via headphones, again from local files. At some point I also enabled the GPS, and tracked Google maps for a while, checking traffic, and location and stuff -- my normal routine en route to a convention. After that, I turned on the phone and went into Hangouts frequently for texts and such. Next up is some Yelping for a place for lunch, typically about 10-20 minutes looking for a good place. After this, more Google Maps to find the place, and to guide us over.\nDuring \"lunch\" it was web browsing via Chrome. Read a few articles (amusingly, read AC's LG G4 review with it) and probably clocked in about an hour reading. Then it was back to Google Maps to \"get back to the venue.\" For the next few hours, I reverted back to spontaneously turning on the phone very frequently for access to Hangouts, and updated a few apps while I was there. Few hours later, and it was time to Yelp for \"dinner.\" Same process as above, Yelp, Google Maps, Web Browsing, Google Maps, then back to checking texts. Finally, after many hours, it was time to wind down, and I loaded up a PDF of a novel I am reading to, uh, read before bed. This part actually was kind of painful for me, since it was like 3am and I really DID want to sleep, but the phone's battery stubbornly refused to drain down to 1%.Result: The phone clocked in over 7 hours of screen-on time if I didn't stream gigabytes of stuff all at once, so I am very happy with this. Even with the \"heavy\" usage, it still lasted over 17 hours off the charger, which is not bad at all. With my Incredible and DNA at least, I would normally have to bump charge them at least once during even a \"normal\" con usage scenario.\nWith all that said, I hope it helps some people with regard to battery life and usage patterns, although I apologize for it getting so long.", "time": "05-09-2015 11:47 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4416082", "text": "It seems like Verizon M9's have the best battery life.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "05-09-2015 01:03 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4416089", "text": "I am on att but using a developers unit.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "05-09-2015 01:06 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4417291", "text": "Awww..Developers unit.

For me, and this will be subjective, I find the M9 to be more comfortable and easier to hold than the M8. I also prefer the aesthetics of the M9 better. I have the Gunmetal version, and I like that it's a little darker and the shinier black sides give it a nice touch. I really like that they split volume into 2 separate buttons instead of a rocker. It feels more solidly built. The M8's rocker felt cheap to me on an otherwise well built phone. Having the power button on the side is an advantage in my opinion as well. \nThe cameras are not bad on either device, but very different. The M8 kind of shines in low light which is the M9's weakness. The M9 takes way better day/well-lit indoor photos. The interface is very similar on the 2 versions of Sense. I do kind of miss a couple of the duo focus camera features, but as a day to day camera the M9 works for my needs.\nBoth phones have BoomSound, but the M9 has Dolby software applied to it.

What I can say, is that if you're looking for a solid, sturdy, well-performing smartphone, then pick up an M9. It's also nice being a bit of an outcast....

This time I'm stuck with the same problem I had a year ago. So just let me explain my story. \nMy first smartphone I had was the iPhone 4, which was the best smartphone ever I had at that point in time. After having the 4 for two years I finally upgraded to the iPhone 5. I enjoyed the eco-system and the way iOS works at that point in time. But then came \"scuffgate\" which alarmed me and I immediately sold my \"Slate Black\" iPhone 5 to get a Galaxy S4. After I got the Galaxy S4 I felt like I was liberated and enjoyed the freedom of having the option to customize lots of things, but at the same down I was also let down by the sluggishness and build quality of the device at that point in time.\nAbout 9 months ago I switched to an LG G3, android and that combination of software was so much smoother and I liked so many things about it. However, there were many times throughout the use of my S4 and G3 that I feel overwhelmed by the options and wished I just had something that would work and is simple. Unfortunately, I dropped my phone from a high place and it got completely destroyed. \nNow I have the option to either continue with an android (Which at the time I have chosen the HTC One M9) or an iPhone 6. The reason I have looked into these two phones are because their UI (in this case also OS) are very simple while the HTC one allowing me to change things if I ever wanted to and also their build. I don't really use my phone for any heavy-lifting, just light media consumption, social media and productivity apps. The reason I also didn't choose the plus despite it having the same screen size as the LG G3 is because the bezels of the G3 are so thin that it's like a 5.2\" phone and the Plus feels like a clunky phone.\nI don't take many pictures either and I really don't care about the camera. My main priorities right now are: Build quality, Reliability, Display, Performance (in terms of day-to-day tasks like opening and closing apps)\nI tend to be quite invested in both of the eco-systems but I find that all of the apps I use (Snapchat, Evernote and various social media) are on the AppStore too, so lets just say that we do not take the eco-systems into this decision.", "time": "05-08-2015 04:38 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4414112", "text": "Do you listen to a lot of music?

Both feel good in the hand, though I prefer the M9 and quite like the gold band on the silver version which gives it a jewellery look. It's also more unique next to the ever so ubiquitous iPhone 6 (space grey would be my pick).\nThe two issues I personally have with the iPhone are the jump from 16gb (way too small) to 64gb and the accompanied hike in price (the M9 is cheaper and adding your own storage is easy); the screen is pretty nice but it's a little outdated next to the S6 and you can notice that it's not as sharp as 1080p+ screens. The latter isn't a big deal but for a 2 year device it does make me hesitant. You're aware of differences in os so no need to mention that, but little things like the lack of sharing on iOS can be annoying (in android you can pretty much share to any app and get a long list but in iOS it's a small select few and you have to do workarounds).\nProblems I have with M9 are what looks like a cooler screen/no advancement from last year's M8 screen, mediocre camera (which you don't care about). The lack of fingerprint scanner may or may not bother you and in exchange you get awesome speakers. If you're like me and watch lots of youtube and podcasts then these get a lot of use and are quite a unique selling point\nOf all the Android devices the M9 is still getting praised for it's lack of lag so I don't think you'll be disappointed with either.

Once I got most of the kinks worked out with my M9 I've been really happy with it. Out of the box I prefer the iPhone 6 to be honest. Apple's stock apps I prefer to HTC's, but the nice thing is you can set 3rd party as default on the M9. I've purposely not been using the 6 since I got my M9 to get completely used to it. The two things I miss the most are TouchID and iMessage (most of the people I text the most are iOS users). The integration with OS X is really nice if you're a Mac user as well. The displays are pretty evenly matched. While the iPhone's colors are a little more true to life, the M9 has a higher resolution and I prefer the way it handles text rendering. Also the display is a little larger. The build quality is great on both. The 6 is really light while the M9 has some heft to it. I like the weight though. When I first pulled the M9 out of the box I instantly realized how much I missed the weight of phones. They've all gotten a bit too light in my opinion recently. The addition of BoomSound is great on the M9 even if you only use it to watch YouTube, movie trailers, etc. But for gaming I love them. The tech also carries over to the headphones too, so it's definitely louder and has punchier sound than the 6,\ntl;dr For your uses I'm pretty sure you've be satisfied with either.

However, it is said that although a linear actuator shakes less, it's intensity is greater and can be felt in the pocket better. Personally, I have found this to be true. I'm not sure why the manufacturers are switching motors, but I have a feeling the fact that motors with linear actuators consume less power has a lot to do with it.

HTC Sense still offers one of the best skinned Android experience in my opinion. The phone has great performance, with great looks to go along with it too (both software and hardware). The build quality is superb, and in my opinion still better than the Galaxy S6. It also has the best sounding speakers you can find on a smartphone to date. But its appeal hinges greatly on whether you are willing to live with the \"quirks\" of the camera.\nIf you are coming from the HTC One M7, this will no doubt be a substantial upgrade. But if you are coming from the HTC One M8, this might not feel like much of an upgrade. In the end, the overall improvements to the device comes across as being pretty minor. Not to mention that the camera quality is pretty underwhelming, especially when comparing it to other 2014/2015 flagship devices. If camera quality is something that is important to you, you might want to look elsewhere instead.\nFlagship devices to me should represent the best of what the company has to offer at that point in time. But I am not convinced that the One M9 is HTC's best effort. To me it felt like a device born out of compromises, constraints, and misplaced priorities. Maybe the new finishing took too much time and money, so they had to skim on the camera and forgo OIS? Maybe with many manufacturers buying up all the Sony camera sensors in the market, HTC as a company with a much smaller order could not secure any stocks at all, and had to go with a Toshiba sensor? Maybe.\nBut what I know for sure, is that this is not the best HTC has to offer.

Thoughts and impressions", "thread": [{"postID": "post4370445", "text": "It has been three weeks since I got the M9 here in Germany, so I wanted to post my impressions so far. Now that I had more time to use the device I think I have a pretty good idea what the good things and what the bad things are. Design: My first impressions were positive and after three weeks I still believe that the design is just great. Yes, it hasn't changed a lot but it doesn't really matter. The M9 is still the most beautifull device out there, or one of the most beautiful. Of course there are other devices out there that have also a great design, but for me the M9 is still the best. I prefer aluminium to glass and the device feels sturdy and better built than the M9. The difference is small though. The location of the power button is perfect. At first I thought that I would accidentally hit it and yes, it did happen once or two times, but now it doesn't happen at all. The special coating on the button makes it easy to differentiate from the volume buttons. Overall I am very happy with the design.BoomSound: I have heard complains that they are not as loud as on the M8, but I can only say two things: They are loud enough and they are great! They offer more deep sounds with better clarity. I am not an audiophile and definitely no expert, but this is my experience so far. I enjoy listening to music, podcasts and watching videos on the M9. A definite improvement over the M8.Speed: The device is really fast and there is no lag in the OS. I experience lag though in some apps, but I cannot see how the device would be the issue here. Twitter and Chrome are two examples where lag when scrolling does occur all the time. I use Talon as my twitter client now and scrolling has been very smooth so far.Sense 7: It's not a big improvement over Sense 6, but the Theming capability is great (but not perfect). I have created 4 themes so far and I can easily switch between them when I am bored  I also love BlinkFeed. It is the first thing I do when I hold my phone. BlinkFeed allows me to get the news very fast and from all sources that interest me. A great solution.Display: I always thought that the M8 display was too red, too saturated, offering unnatural (but nice looking) colors. The M9 is the opposite and I prefer it to the M8. Having said that, I was disappointed to see that the auto brightness didn't work as well as on the M8. It is most of the time too dim and I didn't like it. I found an app on the Play store, \"Yet another auto brightness tool\" and it allowed my to configure min and max brightness levels. The app works really great and have noticed no negative impact on battery life so far. I just wished that HTC had a better out of the box user experience, regarding the display.Battery life: Let's just say that it's ok, with room for improvement. I was on a train two days ago for around 45 minutes. My M9 lost almost 10% battery during these 45 minutes! That's crazy and unacceptable. I am also used to my iPhone 6 Plus that has amazing battery life, but still, the M9 can do better. I would say, I can easily have 4 hours on screen time, especially when using WiFi and when not moving around all the time, between locations. If I use a lot of 4G and move around a lot during the day, then I cannot imagine getting more than 2,5 to 3 hours on screen time from the M9. This is an area where HTC has to improve the M9. Maybe a future update..Camera: This has been discussed a lot. With the XDA thread settings (slightly customized from me with saturation set to 0) I get good to very good pictures in most situations. Is it better than my iPhone? It depends! Try lowering the resolution to small if you want a direct comparison with the iPhone. You would be using 8Mpixel in the small setting. The biggest disappointment though is the video recording. 4K looks awfull and I cannot recommend it to anybody. FullHD video recording is ok to good, depending on how steady you can keep the device. My iPhone has much better video recording capabilties. HTC must improve the video recording experience. For me this is not important, but I can imagine others would have an issue with that. Overall I find the camera to be good though, better than the M8's.Heat: The device does get warm but not up to an unusable level. It can get a bit unpleasant when using the device and charging it at the same time.Charging: HTC should have included the rapid charger accessory that they offer for purchase separately. With the standard charger my M9 needs over 2,5 hours to fully charge. With the rapid charger it needs less than 1,5 hours to fully charge.\nOverall I am still happy with my M9. It is the best HTC One Mx smartphone to date. Is this the best smartphone though?\nI don't think such a thing exists. There are so many devices out there and the two big players, Apple and Samsung have a very strong marketing presence that HTC cannot beat. What I can say though is that the M9 is one of the best smartphones out there. It has its advantages and disadvantages, like any other phone out there. People will have to weigh these and decide what is important to them. \nI personally cannot go away from HTC, because I love its design, the way the M9 feels in the hand, the BoomSound speakers, the BlinkFeed and Sense. These reasons make me stay with HTC. \nThere are areas where HTC can improve though with software updates and I expect them to do:Battery lifeCamera, especially for video recording\nThere are also other areas where HTC should improve for the M10:Provide an overall better user experience. Why need a 3rd party auto brightness tool for example?Provide a better display technology. The current display is still very good, but my iPhone is better. Samsung apparently has the best displays out there. HTC needs to have a great display on the M10. I don't care if it will be 2K though. FullHD is good enough, but the display should use a better display technology. This will be my biggest wish for the M10.Iterate on the design. Do not change the design language but improve it even further!Use USB-C for chargingProvide a 64GB model, but please keep the SD card expansion..", "time": "04-19-2015 12:08 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4370727", "text": "Thanks for the run down, I got the S6 in the end and it's been quite an awkward adjustment although their screen and camera are so good it does balances out the the annoying aspects.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "04-19-2015 04:35 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4371862", "text": "Petvas72 which 3rd party auto brightness app are you using on ur M9?", "time": "04-19-2015 04:40 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4376710", "text": "100% in agreement\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "04-21-2015 04:00 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4370462", "text": "This is an excellent review.

I have come from an M7 and a Desire HD2 so I am obviously a HTC fan. But, I am disappointed because I am already having issues. I have contacted HTC about them, performed their suggestions to to avail. Seeing as though forums are usually loaded with information and people who often have more knowledge than the tech support staff, I thought I would try this first. Here's hoping.\nSo my issues started about a week ago. The power button started to become unresponsive to turning the screen on and off. To begin with, it was intermittent. It was a bit of a nuisance mainly because I could not turn the screen off, but enough pushing and it worked. A double tap turns it on, so not real issue there. But as time has gone on, the problem has now reached a stage where its simply unresponsive, and I have had to change the time out to help the battery. I called HTC and they suggested I start in safe mode. This seemed to work. I had no issues with it, so I began to think it was an app conflict. so I booted my phone as per usual, and began rolling back my apps. Eventually, the button became useless. It simply failed to respond, at all. I did a full factory reset, a full restore. No difference. Reset again without the restore (factory apps only), still no change. Now, the button must work because oddly enough, if I push the power button and the volume down button, it wakes up. In all, I hope someone comes up with a solution that maybe something I have inadvertently done has changed the way the hardware is responding, I dont know. It will be better than returning it, going without it when HTC will likely replace it anyway. Other than this issue, I find it to be a great phone.

I really do like most things about it. I guess problems wouldn't be the right word. More just different ways Android handles things than iOS. Here's my first impressions post:\nThe good:\nIt's a beautiful phone, and the pics/videos don't do it justice. On the gunmetal version the sides are a shiny black, while the rest of the device is a darker gunmetal than the M8. The back looks really elegant, while the front has a more industrial look. I would say the back looks better than my iPhone 6, but the front isn't as elegant as the iPhone. I still think the front looks good though.\nIt feels great in the hand. It has weight, but it's not too heavy or wide. I don't so much worry about the height of a phone. Width is more important to me. \nI have no problems with the display as some reviewers mentioned. It's a little cooler, but not super noticeable sitting next to my iPhone. I watched the Avengers trailer, and the only time I really noticed a big difference is when the screen is using all primary colors. I'd imagine animated videos might not look so good, but I haven't tried that yet. Skin tones are a little cooler, but don't look unnatural.\nThe sound coming from the speakers is as impressive as ever. It may be a little quieter, but the quality of sound more than makes up for it. The theater mode sounds amazing. The music mode is a little louder (about the volume I remember from the M8), but loses some of the clarity and punch of theater mode.\nThe interface is great. If you liked Sense in the past, you'll like the newest version. I removed Sense Home because I didn't think it would be useful, and I prefer a less cluttered display. I may put it back to test on one of the secondary screens just to give it a shot later. The themes are cool, but I haven't really delved too deeply into making my own (I've only had the phone since this afternoon).\nEverything is really smooth with no choppiness or stuttering that I've seen so far. \nThe bad:\nIt drives me a little crazy that I can't seem to find a way to turn on a notification sound for incoming email using the stock mail app. There's probably a setting to do so, but I haven't found it yet.\nAlso I can't seem to find a way to set custom SMS notification alerts for different people. I use this a lot. It really bothers me, probably more than it should.\nThis is with all of Android, but I still find iOS apps to look a little better, and in some cases more functional than their Android counterparts. Not HTC's fault though.\nThe indifferent:\nI don't find the sleep/wake button to be as uncomfortable to press as some reviewers, but it is a little low for my taste. I do push the volume down button sometimes instead of hitting the sleep/wake. I may or may not get used to it over time. \nI use a MBP as my computer, and I find transferring things back and forth to be cumbersome. It's not really a dealbreaker, but I do wish there was a smoother alternative.\nI prefer the screen to light up when I get incoming text messages. I know I had an app on my M8 that handled that, but I've forgotten what it's called. It's a little disappointing it doesn't have the option out of the box though.\nNot tested:\nThe two biggest gripes forum members and reviewers have seem to be the battery life and camera. Unfortunately I just haven't had the phone long enough to make a decision either way. While setting up I didn't even have a sim in it, and kept it charging. Since then It's been charging on and off while I moved photos, music, ringtones, etc. from my computer to the phone. I did notice one possibly bad omen for battery life. While testing the video between the iPhone 6 and M9 I turned brightness to 100% and auto-brightness off on both devices. They both started almost fully charged. The iPhone's battery percentage didn't change, but the M9 went down 3%. I've only taken 3 photos. All on auto and in my bedroom after work. They weren't good, but not bad either. Just kinda somewhere inbetween. Hopefully my next off day I'll be able to take both phones out and about with me to take some photos to compare.\nSorry if I rambled. Just getting my first impressions out there.\nAs an update to that: \nI've found solutions to the email issue. CloudMagic is a great 3rd party email app I've set as default. \nI still haven't tried a 3rd party SMS app, but I know there are some that allow to set different tones for different people. \nAnother thing I miss is having the screen light up for a couple seconds when I get a text. I'm not sure if a 3rd party app will help with that or not.\nI do miss TouchID and iMessage a lot! Not so much to switch back though. \nAnother issue I found almost a dealbreaker for me was browsers. I couldn't find one that automatically resized videos to fullscreen. It may not sound like a big deal, but trying to get embedded videos (movie trailers, reviews, etc.) to play fullscreen drove me crazy. If you install Dolphin browser, then Dolphin Jetpack it does resize videos on most sites! \nBattery life has been comparable for my uses. Standby may not be quite as good, but it's not bad either.\nThe camera isn't as bad as reviewers make it out to be. If you go down to the bottom of this link I've posted comparison shots between my iPhone 6 and my M9. http://forums.androidcentral.com/htc...your-m9-3.html The M9 takes great pics in good lighting. I'm still figuring out lower light shots, but I honestly just haven't taken many pics yet. Indoors with decent lighting the pics look great, but I need to take some time to get out to bars/restaurants for some low light testing. neo95 on here gave a great tip to use HDR for night shots with ISOMax set at 200.\nOverall I'm pretty happy with my M9 though. Considering I could put my sim back in my iPhone anytime I wanted to and I haven't says something. I've had every iPhone since the 3G in 2008, and this is the first phone that's made me stick with Android for more than 2 weeks.", "time": "05-04-2015 01:13 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4405935", "text": "Thanks a lot msm0511.

There are a few little things I'm discovering that I like, such as the shortcut to add apps to folders. So far, pretty smooth and haven't noticed any lag, although I don't like the way the app drawer scrolls. (one page at a time, vs a touch sensitive continuous scrolling). The included notification sounds are really quite good, and enjoyable to listen to.\nWhat I don't like, is the T-Mobile bloatware, which I expected to be there. But, it has taken me a while to disable it, aside from TMo Visual Voicemail, which I do use. I haven't used the HTC added apps much yet. The \"home/out/work\" widget is unusual. Not sure how I feel about that, but the downloads and suggested apps folders on the widget were a bit annoying. \nHave not used the camera yet.

I just got a Verizon HTC One M9 a week ago. I consider myself an audiophile, or at least an audiophile on a budget. I'd just like to report that this One M9 excels when it comes to audio. Everybody knows the speakers on the phone itself are awesome for phone speakers, but the headphone output is really impressive too. Everything from in ear monitors to my full size open back AKG Q701 sound great with it and there is tons of power on tap. With boomsound off and using an app like Neutron or Poweramp the sound quality is quite impressive. I have an AKG Q701 that is modded, a Brainwavz HM5, Vsonic GR01 balanced armature in ears, and the HiFi-Man RE-Zero in ears as well. The 3 latter I have been cycling through for the last week, but tonight I decided to try the full size and power hungry Q701 with this phone and am still impressed. 60-80% on the volume and they are being driven quite well. \nI haven't seen these specs posted for the M9 yet, but I have read a few people claim the M9 has even more power output than the M8. These #'s are for the M8:\n15 Ohm 33 Ohm 150 Ohm\t330 Ohm\nOutput Power 95.55 mW\t47.63 mW\t11.14 mW\t5.116 mW\nOutput Voltage\t1.197 Vrms\t1.254 Vrms\t1.293 vRMS\t1.299 Vrms\nThese #'s may not mean much to most people, but this kind of power output without using an external amp is quite impressive. That is very good output for a smartphone or any stand alone music player. Now days there are music players like the Fiio X3 that still put out quite a bit more power than the M8 or M9 though, but still, it's impressive for a smartphone. The Iphone 5 only puts out a max of 32.5mw, Nexus 5 and Galaxy S5 only put out 22mw, and supposedly the Galaxy S4 is only capable of 4mw. \nIt's not just the power output that is impressive, it's the overall sound quality. Clean, clear, detailed, and flat sound when boomsound is off. Bass is definitely more powerful and impactful when compared to my old S4, and I'd blame that on the added power and headroom. \nI usually drive my AKG Q701 right out of the speaker outputs of a 50 watt per channel(@8ohms) speaker amplifier. Yes, they are usually hard wired right to the speaker outputs. When plugged into the M9, the Q701 sound at least 95% as good and that is damn impressive. \nSo this phone may not have the best camera, or the best lcd screen, but the sound is the best and has the highest output whether you are using the phones speakers or your favorite headphones. I spend much more time using headphones and the phones speakers than the camera, which I do still find to do a well enough job, but that is another story. So I know this phone isn't doing all that well and is the underdog right now compared to the Galaxy S6 and the Iphone, but it has it's strengths.", "time": "04-29-2015 10:38 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4396600", "text": "I actually tried out a Samsung S6 edge for the last 3 days..

A little practice and you should be able to set the camera to pretty close in about 2 seconds, and bracket a few shots on either side in another 2 seconds.

However, the M9's 'short and simple' sounds all sound similar and are very hard to distinguish from each other... because they are short. They are also very 'quiet and polite'. I either don't hear them at (especially at work) or I can't determine what the notification is trying to tell me. Is there a way to get louder and more distinguishing sounds added to the selection? The old Motorola \"Captain's Log\" notification was perfect (and I am not a StarTrek fan... LOL). \n2. I am a diabetic. My old Motorola Droid had a feature that allowed ICE (In Case of Emergency) numbers to be dialed directly from the lock screen along with medic alert information. Is there anything like this feature on the M9?\n3. I have watched several YouTube videos about Tips and Tricks for the M9. One of those tips was info about the \"Quick Settings\" screen that can be pulled down with a double swipe. It talked about a \"screenshot\" shortcut that can be added to the screen. That feature is not shown on my phone. It is not present in the top (active) list or the lower (disabled) list. What do I have to do to get this feature? \n4.

It takes a little practice, but once you've got it it's like second nature.\nOn the stock launcher, there is no double tap to sleep. However, you can now edit your Navigation Bar buttons to include a \"Turn Off Screen\" button that will be beside your Back/Home/Recents keys.

I'm coming from a Droid DNA which has died due to an exploding battery, so while many reviewers seem to be decrying HTC's lack of imagination in re-designing the M9, I'm quite happy with it since I never even had an M7. (I'll admit that the DNA still looks pretty damn good, though. I'd still be using it if the battery didn't die.)\nIn any case, I've been reading around about the various little issues people have, and one thing I came across was people saying to reset the phone to factory state for some reason. Can anyone explain this? As of now I have just returned from the store after having activated the phone, and while I believe I can make calls with it and everything, it's currently not even hooked up to my Google account yet. Would hitting the factory restore do anything, or am I already in a clean state?\nThe interface has also changed quite a bit, so it will take some time to get used to and figure out where all the settings are again, but are there any particular settings that I should know to toggle (on or off) that might be hidden somewhere, or otherwise tricky to find? My main priority is probably anything that might help with battery life.\nI'm sure I may have some more when I come across them, but for now I'd just like to know about this reset thing I've read about.\nOtherwise it'll be the laborious process of setting everything up again...\nThanks!", "time": "04-23-2015 06:12 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4382204", "text": "I personally didn't restore mine when I updated the system apps, and didn't have any problems.

I\u2019m still within my 14-day return period, but I\u2019ve had more than enough time to decide if the M9 is the best device for me based on my usage. I\u2019ll go ahead and cover my observations based on certain categories that are of most importance to me.Battery Life (Like It)\nThe battery life is better than I expected and will easily last me all day with some to spare. I\u2019m averaging about 4.5 hours SOT. So far I have not found myself hunting for a power source before I get home. Also the quick charging is a nice feature to have though it can warm the phone up a little.Performance (Love It)\nThe Sense 7 UI is as smooth and functional as ever and I\u2019ve not had instances of force closures, non-responsive apps, delays, etc with the native nor core Google apps. I\u2019ve not had performance issues with task switching, gaming, etc. Also I think something is wrong with my M9 because it hasn\u2019t overheated yet. Display (Could be better)\nI\u2019m not too pleased with one aspect of the display. It has nothing to do with the resolution, brightness, or outdoor visibility. All of those qualities are very good to my eyes. However (and this is nitpicking), the color temperature calibration is driving me insane, especially when it comes to taking pictures in manual mode. It makes it almost impossible to get the white balance to match what the eye sees, since the display is so far off to begin with. Audio (Love it)\nThis is HTC\u2019s best iteration of BoomSound to date. The headphone output is ridiculously good and I was pretty impressed with the internal amplifier and the BoomSound audio processing when engaged. The external speakers too are the best sounding I\u2019ve heard so far. I\u2019ll also add that the Theater Mode really allows the Dolby processing to shine.Camera (Could be better)With that said, I find the rear facing camera to be decent to good under the right lighting conditions. In lowlight indoor environments, it isn\u2019t something that I\u2019d bother with, unless I\u2019m using the flash. I\u2019m pleased with how the flash performs in lowlight settings. It seems that HTC has learned how to tune the flash output as to not overpower the subject. The front facing camera gives good results and the Ultrapixel tech really shines in low light environments. I will say I\u2019m glad that HTC addressed a common issue with the M8 and added sapphire glass to cover the rear camera.Video (Hate It)\nThis is a functionality that I would personally use on a smartphone before I would use it on my DSLR and is of great importance to me. When I\u2019m out with my family and or friends, 9 times out of 10 I\u2019d use the video recording capability before taking stills. The M9\u2019s video recording prowess needs a lot of work that I doubt HTC has the time or resources to address them. The aggressive metering/exposure compensation, inconsistent bitrate, schizo autofocus, poorly implemented image stabilization all result in a very mediocre experience. The metering and exposure adjustment are so strong, that even under ideal lighting conditions, the experience is ruined due to the exposure changing too fast when the focal point changes (unless AF/AE lock is engaged). In lowlight, the video quality is too underexposed to be saved even by engaging the flash. My anger with HTC is that this behavior has been observed by me since the EVO 3D days and I am confused as to why they haven\u2019t changed or improved it.Build Quality (Love it)\nNot much else to say, other than the materials and craftsmanship (not to be confused with design) is the best I\u2019ve seen to date for any smartphone (IMO). Every square inch is constructed with absolute perfection. I can\u2019t think of any other phone with better build than the M9.Conclusion \nI can say for sure that I will be keeping the M9. Had I strictly gone off of the reviews, I probably would not have even bothered looking at the M9. Once I owned it and used it for myself, then I realized that all of my apprehensions were way overblown. Not to mention that I feel a lot of the reviewers were being glorified drama queens all because it didn't live up to the leaked renders. The battery life for me isn\u2019t as bad as I thought it would be, the BoomSound sounds better than I thought it would, the Sense 7 UI is the best iteration ever (which at first I thought the time spent adding the themes was a waste of time). The user experience has been very good for me (sans my complaints about the video recording). \nI feel that best aspects of the M9 are: Media consumption (audio in particular)UI PerformanceUI CustomizationUI social networking integrationBuild qualityCall quality\nHowever, when it comes to the best display, I'll give that title to Samsung. When it comes to the best battery life, no one comes close to Sony.

I'm not saying this to discredit the S6 (which Samsung did an amazing job with), but the design language for the non-edge variant is hardly a departure from that of the S5/4/3. Yet, it doesn't receive the same amount of criticism of the M9. Also, before anyone chimes in about how the S6 uses more premium materials compared to its predecessor, let's not confuse term design with the build of a device.

I've posted elsewhere but since you did such a nice review I'll summarize my thoughts here so people searching can get the info they need to make a decision all in one place.\nI am apparently not a typical smart phone user. I typically use my phone primarily for running Waze as I drive a lot; so functionality in the car is important to me. I do use the camera essentially as a cheap utility device, I'm not trying to take \"great\" pictures, I'm usually trying to take pictures to document something for work, so as long as it works, I'm happy.\nSo out of the box the phone is apparently a big step up from my last phone, a Motorola Photon Q 4G LTE (there's a mouthful!) which worked splendidly for my needs but I'm assuming that it was software and app updates had taxed it to the point where it was just so slow and unresponsive to be essentially unusable. I ended up buying the HTC One M9 in a hurry and without testing it in store because while several local Sprint stores had them on display, none of them were functional (!) I was breaking a fundamental rule of mine but I found myself needing to stay in touch with people reliably and my old phone simply wasn't cutting it.\nFirst of all, as you'd expect, the phone only ships with an AC charger and Micro USB cable. So you'll need a rapid car charger to use this in a car. I'll have to pick up one of those, because my old Motorola charger barely keeps the battery level constant while running Waze with the screen on low brightness. With the screen brightness on \"automatic\" the battery will slowly discharge. So this is a \"must have\" accessory.\nAdditionally, it appears that there is no official car kit for this phone. This is a HUGE drawback for me as I was used to just slapping my old Photon into the mount and having it automatically go into car mode, hit the Waze button and I'm going. I'm still quicker now plugging the phone in, sitting it in the ashtray, and manually starting Waze than I was waiting for the Photon to do its thing toward the end, but it is still not convenient. If you look on HTC's web site, they do sell a universal car dock, but for $50 I shouldn't have to manually insert a cable after placing my phone in it. Hopefully this will be rectified soon.\nAdditionally, I've found that my last two phones (both Motorola) apparently had dual radios while the HTC One M9 does not. What this means is apparently until Sprint gets their act together with VoLTE I will be unable to use data while on the phone. This means that I don't get real time updates from Waze if I have to make a phone call while driving. Again, a real drawback.\nPossibly due to the metal case, I seem to drop connection in marginal areas more often than I did with the Photon, but then again, Motorola pretty much is the top of the class when it comes to radios.\nOverall, I'm happy with the phone, and it does appear to be a stylish, rugged piece of equipment, but the lack of what I consider crucial accessories and the lack of data while talking do kind of put a few points against this phone. Just some things to think about and look at if you're comparison shopping for a new phone and your usage aligns with mine.", "time": "04-21-2015 07:18 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4375493", "text": "Someone posted that turning on \"Advanced Calling\" allows data/voice usage. .

Yes, the OIS can help brighten low light images just a tad by allowing the shutter to stay open a smidge longer, but I think smudging and oil painting effects would still persist if the sensor or image processing algo's were bad.\nI guess one way to test this theory is to set a manual iso/shutter speed on the htc one m9, and take a low light exposure while resting it somewhere solid to prevent motion shake. if the smudging still persists, i'd say OIS wouldn't have made much of a difference. i'll have to give this a try tonight.", "time": "04-16-2015 02:34 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4364369", "text": "Yeah I'm interested to know the results of your test.

Here's why:\nI just got my M9 yesterday, coming from a Nexus 5. I was very happy with my Nexus, and the only reason I upgraded was because of a hardware issue on my particular device. It's funny, but this actually resulted in me going backwards in OS versions (from 5.1 on the Nexus to 5.0.2 on the M9). I am pretty sure that there's something about 5.0 that is bad on battery life, because there was a noticeable improvement when my N5 updated to 5.1. I suspect this could be related to why both the M9 and Galaxy S6 have less than stellar reviews on battery life.\nAnyway, knowing product life cycles, you are essentially reducing the useful life of your phone by purchasing a year-old device when the newer version is already available. What if there's a significant update say, 18 months from now, and the M9 gets it but the M8 does not? Maybe you don't care if you're someone who gets a new phone every year, but seeing that you're coming from a 2012 Razr, I assume you won't be buying a new phone next year. I don't buy a new phone every year, so when I do, I get the latest and greatest available at the time so that my phone isn't close to being sunset by year 2.\nThat being said, if you're happy with the device as-is and don't believe OS updates will enhance your experience, then perhaps the cost savings is of greater priority to you.", "time": "04-08-2015 10:20 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4339750", "text": "All good points.

My RMHD had absolutely no issues on Jellybean, then I was forced to upgrade to Kitkat. All of a sudden I started having issues with bluetooth audio skipping, Foxfi stopped working and so forth. Kitkat basically messed up a perfectly good phone. From the reports I am reading Lollipop is pretty much a disaster. Honestly, I have been on Android since 2.1 and I don't ever remember an upgrade that did more good than harm. I wish Android would give us the option to refuse upgrades, once I get my phone set up the way I want it, just leave me alone. \nCost is not an issue for me, it's mainly about battery life. Coming from an RMHD with a 3200 mah battery that easily gives me a day and a half or two days of normal use, I can't see \"upgrading\" to a phone that can't even get through a day.

I guess with more themes coming it can be toned down though. But I just prefer the understatedness of Sense.\nThe camera is great. If taking pictures was my number one priority I would consider it. But it's not for me. Its to thin and I prefer a curved back. The camera sticking out like it does bothers me. I was just meh about the phone in general. \nThe edge wasn't comfortable to hold at all.

Although the 1080p resolution isn\u2019t really a problem in actual use, the lack of improvement or regression in every other metric suggests that HTC has gone backwards in display quality. Combined with the removal of PSR, it\u2019s concerning to see that cost optimization has affected such a crucial aspect of the smartphone experience. Overall, even when comparing against 2014 smartphones the One M9 ends up closer to the bottom for display quality.\nThe software experience seems to be one area where HTC continues to do relatively well compared to most Android OEMs, and Sense 7 remains a relatively enjoyable experience. However, the new additions to Sense 7 aren\u2019t really all that helpful. There\u2019s a lot of effort spent on introducing new features like additional personalization and some new widgets and applications, but none of this really feels well-differentiated, and there isn\u2019t much change to the rest of the UI to make it mesh with Lollipop\u2019s UI. It also seems that Snapdragon 810 causes some minor performance issues, but the effects of this are incredibly minor and it\u2019s hard to tell whether this is due to random variance to some extent.\nAlthough we\u2019re still missing some of the pieces, based upon what data we have the One M9 is in an alarming place for a new smartphone. It\u2019s pretty rare that a new phone ends up regressing in almost every major way compared to an old phone, but the One M9 ends up doing this in display and battery life. The SoC is better, but I can\u2019t help but feel that Snapdragon 805 ends up being a better choice than Snapdragon 810 for a flagship smartphone at this time. The Snapdragon 808 may be better suited as an upgrade to the Snapdragon 805, but given the performance of the 810 I\u2019m not really holding my breath. Given all of these issues, I\u2019m almost tempted to point to the One M8 as the better phone, but until we get the full picture we won\u2019t be coming to any final conclusions about the One M9.", "time": "03-23-2015 08:20 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4300566", "text": "HTC should have went with QHD like I said, although their intention for a 1080p display was good, I think a QHD would have been much better in terms of a 2015 flagship device", "time": "03-23-2015 10:38 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4300601", "text": "They even said there's nothing wrong with a 1080p screen.

All of them complied, but tweakers.net decided to man-up and told htc that they wouldn't, because they didn't break any agreement.\nThere was this huge argument on reddit with one of the senior editors of tweakers and some rep from htc regarding potential lawsuits. It was hilarious and amusing, but I don't wanna go into detail about what they said, because I don't wanna type all that out.\nIn any case, the guy from tweakers told reddit that the excuse htc gave for the embargo delay was about some boot-loading sequence.

But couldn't control myself and bought the M9 from T-Mobile store today. Got to say I'm impressed.\n1. Build quality, looks, feel of holding in the hand - Got to say M9 still feels so much nicer, premium to hold in the hand, more comfortable as well. Even though S6 stepped up a lot still feel M9 is the best.\n2. Performance - Both are awesome and works well. Though had M9 only for a day personally will take Sense over touchwiz any day. Trust Sense and M9 to perform better over a period of time than S6.\n3. Display - Both are great, some say S6 is the best and you can't use any other phone after using it ( Phil mentioned in today's podcast as well). I agree that S6 is the best but I was equally impressed about M9. At least I don't have any issues with M9 display and perfectly fine for a flagship.\n4. Battery life - Well don't know about M9 since just got it today but honestly I don't care. Have fast charger in my car, home etc so doesn't bother me on both M9 and S6.\n5. Sound - Well no contest, M9 by a landslide. But got to agree with others saying it's not that impressive compared to M8.\n6. Camera - Well no contest, S6 by a landslide although haven't got the update on T-Mobile and haven't tweaked the camera setting still. But either way I'm not expecting miracles and probably not going to beat S6 or G4. That's fine for me since I'll be swapping between the S6 or iPhone 6 frequently.\n7. Overheating - Got little warm while downloading lots of apps from play store and at the same time doing other tasks. Even S6 gets hot certain time so the overheating issue is a non issue for me. I'm not running benchmarks or I'm not a huge gamer so I'll be perfectly fine for daily usage.\n8. Themes - Definitely better theming support and lot better themes with M9 than the S6. But that will improve with S6 as time passes so no big deal.\nConclusion:\nIf camera is important and you just don't want to worry about your photos after taking every shot then buy S6 and move on.\nOtherwise, the M9 is a great phone and you will not be disappointed. You have to hold this to know how premium it feels. I wrote it off as well after reading all negative reports but had forgot how good HTC devices feel and how well sense performs.

However, if you think/know that you can't get by on one of the newer data plans that are in your price range, then I wouldn't upgrade. If you check your monthly data usage, and you can afford one with the amount of data you normally use, then I'd say go for it. If not with the M9, you could always go for the less expensive M8. I checked the Rezound's dimensions, and it may just be the size difference that made you feel like you would drop it. The size/weight difference is something most people adjust to with a little time. I can't imagine the Rezound has louder audio than any phone with stereo speakers, but maybe I'm wrong. I have no problem with the volume for alerts, notifications, etc. In fact, it's much too loud at full volume in my opinion.

The average consumer either does not have time to tinker with their camera settings or does not know what each setting does. All they want is a camera that takes good shots without any effort and tinkering and does it quickly, at least from my personal experience from other users.\nTake a phone from the average Joe and you'll most likely see it in Auto mode. Take one from me and it's either in Auto mode or Manual exposure mode, though you'll most likely see it in auto mode as when I take pictures with my phone, it's for quick-shots that I want to capture without spending time tinkering with the settings. For shots where beauty is key, I take my Sony a6000 and spend time tinkering with the settings until they are perfect.\nThis is why the Galaxy S6 and the LG G3 are currently my 2 favorite smartphone cameras.

Then he could say something like this with respect to the camera. I am using the phone that doesn't have the update that the international model does. It does improve the picture quality so software updates may in the future continue to refine the images but don't expect miracles because there are limits to what can be accomplished given the hardware.

(I got it one day shipping at the start of pre-order) \nI had a galaxy, a M8, a LG G3, and now the M9.\nI personally think the G3 is one of the best android phones available, but I wanted a smaller screen, so I was going to by the s6 or the M9.\nIs the M9 very similar to the M8. Yes, no getting around that. If you're looking for a whole new phone/experience then you won't be happy. \nBut if you're truly interested in owning a great device all things considered, I do think it's in the convo for best phone available right now. \nI've found it to be fast, great battery, great screen, and a pleasure to use. \nRegarding the camera: I'm a regular guy, I don't pretend to be a professional photographer and use my phone as my tool for that...it take pics of my kids, etc. And for that I say it's great. I've especially enjoyed being able to change the light exposure on both the M8 and M9 by choosing a focus point by tap. All in all, it's completely fine for this normal guy. Not saying they shouldn't continue to improve it, but as it stands it does what I need. \nRegarding \"running hot\", I haven't experienced anything abnormal in comparison to the last 6 android phones I've used. Meaning downloading a file while charging and watching YouTube does make the phone get warm, just like the others. But not doing several heavy usage things at once, no warming here. Regular usage has been fine...normal android experience. \nRegarding the battery life: I feel, as with every other new phone I got, they figured out a way to get a little more life out of an increasing powerful phone. I'm fine with it. We live in America, if I don't make it through a day(rare), then there are charging options all around me. It's better, and certainly not any worse then my last 4 phones. \nI really appreciate the form changes they made. The M8 was hard to hold, but this is better. The quality on the device, like the M8, is top of the class in my opinion. No one is designing a higher quality form factor. It's beautiful and solid. \nI have complaints, like a lack of flexibility on home screen app grid, or the great idea to move the power button being overshadowed by it being to easily confused with the volume buttons. But none of these things ruin my experience. No phone I've had is flawless. \nFinally, a company that will replace it for free if you damage it within the first year. That's incredible. Other companies should stand behind their products like that. \nAll in all I'm very happy. \nJust my two cents.

Where does this disappointment come from though? Who set their expectations so high? For so many years almost every manufacturer has iterated but there have never been so many negative comments..\nThe three main points that reviewers are mentioning are battery life, design and the camera. Let's have a look at all three:\nBattery life: Yes, the M8 has better battery life, but I think there is room for improvement here, especially with Lolipop 5.1 Having said that, battery life should be enough to get almost anyone through the day. Every night we would charge our devices anyway...I would do that for my iPhone 6 Plus anyway, despite the fact that it could easily last for 1,5 days. (because I want to be able to get through the whole day and not just half a day..)\nPerformance: The M9 is really fast, faster than the M8. I don't care about benchmarks. Benchmarks do not tell the truth! The truth is that the M9 will not slow down, no matter what you throw at it, and that is what counts. Anandtech is just benchmarking devices. I wonder if they get to use them at all..\nCamera: Everybody has been waiting for a great camera and HTC unfortunately didn't deliver on the software front. The XDA thread clearly proves that. The M9 and with the right settings (found at the XDA thread) can take beautiful pictures, on par with the iPhone (or close to it). \nAnandtech also complains about the display. I had the M8 and I prefer this one much better. Having said that, of course it would be great if HTC used an even better display technology, or an even more accurate display. Many other publications disagree with Anandtech about the display. For example, The Verge gave it a 10 out of 10..(which is also too much). The truth is, the display should be a joy to use and in real life you won't have any issues with it. I hope though that next year the display will be the best of its kind. ( I don't care about the resolution).\nDesign: Yes, it's an evolution, but we seem to forget that this was the best design of 2014. Now it's even better and it remains the best or one of the best. Reviewers seem to be drinking the Samsung S6 cool aid and forget that Samsung always produced devices that were ugly or/and of mediocre quality..\nHTC just needs to work more in the out of the box experience, especially regarding the camera. They must also work on their marketing strategy, in order to change expectations and perception...\nThe M9, as found by many other reviewers, but mainly from many that actually use the device as their daily driver, is one of the best devices of 2015. Is it the best? This year the competition is harder, so it's difficult to say. Everyone should know for themselves if the M9 is what they are looking for. \nFor me the M9 is the best phone because of the following reasons:It feels really great in the hand. The device makes me want to use it all the time, something I cannot even say for the iPhone 6 which I stopped using since I got the M9.It has amazing BoomSound speakers. Much better than the M8. I am not an audiophile but I can hear the difference to the M8 immediately.It's a very fast device, on par with the other flagships. Comparing it to the iPhone 6 Plus I cannot see a difference. Mostly apps will load faster on my M9..Sense & Blinkfeed: I just love it, especially Blinkfeed and the new theming engine. I know I can have them other One devices too, but I judge the whole package..", "time": "04-07-2015 12:14 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4337214", "text": "Based on the reviews and user feedback, it's clear that the M9 just isn't as good of a phone as many people were hoping.

Any ideas on how to fix this would be much appreciated.\nI've also noticed that when I go into the Facebook app settings and select a notification ringtone, the writing underneath doesn't change to the name of the sound I've chosen - as it does with the rest of the phone - not sure if this is normal or part of the issue either?\nMany Thanks\nMamfa", "time": "04-06-2015 07:44 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4339138", "text": "Welcome to Android Central!\nDid you ever figure out what the issue was with Facebook?", "time": "04-08-2015 07:10 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4339323", "text": "Hi\nThe problem was basically just my own stupidity and unfamiliarity with Android and the Sense version of Facebook.\nHaving previously been an iPhone user, I was used to getting push notifications for everything on Facebook (wall posts, comments, tags, requests, likes - the lot).

HTC could have gone two ways with the M9, but it's not as easy as a choice as some would assume. Do you take a phone that many have said is the best and most beautiful, and make it better? Or do your throw it out and try to figure something completely new out, and hope it sticks. Yes, they took the safe path, and for a company that is just getting a profit under it's belt thanks to the M7 and M9, it's not an unreasonable decision. I was with the crowd that wanted a dramatic glass screen, but hey, it is what it is. The Karmann Ghia only had three exterior changes in nearly 20 years, but I still get girls showing on my porch asking about it. Sometimes beauty is beauty. I'm expecting HTC to do something dramatic for the M10, with the M9 buying them time. I hope.\nNow about the review: It's not really a review... it's a bashing, and I'm calling outright BS on a lot of things. Heat? 102 degrees is 4 degrees warmer than normal body temperature. Yeah, 4 degrees will burn off your finger prints and singe the hair off your head. Have a relative that just passed away? Forget cremation costs and just toss an M9 in the box with 'em.\nThe M8 gets to 103 degrees while gaming, 105 while bench marking. The M4 hit 113 degrees while gaming, and probably should be banned from Egypt to protect the Great Pyramids from burning to the ground.\nAluminum is thermally efficient at moving heat, so when the battery and SoC get busy, you will feel it quick. No need to panic, it's just doing a good job. No need to worry that your two rounds of \"Leo's Fortune\" has had a measurable impact on global warming.\nAnd anybody slamming Sense like that is obviously got a different take on reality. Even folks that love TouchWiz acknowledge that Sense is smooth and fast. I have not used an M9 in person yet, but Sense on the M8 is flawlessly fast. Now, the power button move I'll agree with, as I preferred it on the top. I use an M8 to record athletic events, and the tripod clip will not work with the M9.\nThe last items that stand out in the bashing sess... er, I mean article, are that the speakers are not necessary. The list of devices that have better sound is zero at last count. Even an audio measurement specialist (who tests JBL and Bose speakers for a living), said they were better than any phone, and better than most tablets as well. Yeah, well, other phones don't have that much space used by the speakers and chambers, and they don't sound as good either. And the big news flash that the author missed the memo on?

That used to be the case with every phone (and to be honest, will be the case with every phone, probably always)... but others seem to be making greater strides in some of the areas HTC is still struggling - camera in particular. There will be compromises with every phone - everyone needs to decide what compromises they want to make and which are deal breakers.\nAnother interesting thing I've noticed. I'd call most of the M9 reviews \"luke warm\". At least that's how I've interpreted most of them. Most have had some very positive things to say, while pointing out some of the short comings.

Now the camera I understand is non-final software so hopefully that could be improved a lot (and I really hope it is seeing as it's going to be released in Taiwan in a few days) but Sense getting minimal upgrades as well is unacceptable to me. Adding Yelp to Blinkfeed and a themeing engine seems kinda lazy to me.

I don't care for it and instead of putting those man hours into hand finishing the M9, I would have liked more effort into getting the camera right or adding more software improvements.

Only thing that's questionable about the S6 for me right now is the battery life. No one at MWC could give opinions on that (for obvious reasons) so I'll have to wait for reviews.

They've used the same pyramid architecture for some time where they mount the battery closest to the display and then the mainboard and other components on top. As for the display, usage of the same display panel type (i.e., SLCD 3)was probably cheaper than using more current tech.

I'll try to explain why the general opinion of the device is ho-hum (or at least why my opinion is that).Design:\nAs you mentioned, when HTC revealed the M7 back in 2013, it was a beautiful looking device. But now in 2015, the design is starting to edge on the stale side. Aside from that, there are some changes which I don't like about the M9:\n- The M7 had nice tight corners, whereas the M8 and M9 have larger rounded corners\n- The M7 had symmetrical speakers both top and bottom. The M8 had asymmetrical speakers where the top speaker was shorter than the bottom, and the M9 seems to make it even smaller\n- The M7 and M8 had circular camera modules which I preferred over the M9's now square module\n- The M7's black bar had a useful feature in the capacitive buttons. The M8 and M9 have the black bar with no use other than to house the internal components - from a design standpoint, it doesn't look that nice\n- The two-tone metal finish on the M9 is said to take twice as long to manufacture, but does that make the phone better/look nicer? Is that an actual improvement to the phone?\n- I just think this third iteration now should have had a distinct aesthetic change. Even the M8 changed a bit from the M7. The M9 changed little from the M8.\nThe thing about design is that it's all subjective. While I still think the M9 is one of the nicer looking designs, it is getting a bit stale to me an no longer as impressive as the M8 and certainly not the M7 when they were revealed.Camera:\nProbably the biggest 'issue' with the M7 and M8 phones. I had the M7 and currently have the M8 and have taken great photos with both phones. However the cameras did have their limitations and when compared to other flagship devices, if fell very short in well lit shots.\nFrom my understanding there have been reviews with the new camera software (Android Central is one of them) who still say the pictures taken with the M9 aren't very good and in certain cases, takes worse shots than last year's M8. This to me is completely unacceptable. They had been criticised for two years now about the camera, they knew it, accepted it and have responded to it by providing a new 20mp shooter, but it isn't really much better. Hardware specs aside (how on earth does a 9.6mm thick phone with the camera module sticking out not be able to fit OIS?) it seems like their software image processing is worse. Other companies are just killing them on the camera front. Images from the S6 on various websites legitimately look like a couple of generations ahead of the M9's camera. Software:\nSense imo is the best looking and performing OEM skin on the market. I love Sense 6 even more than stock android - I think it legitimately looks and performs that good. Sense 7 looks to be even better, however looks more like Sense 6.5 (as Android Central call it). The UI is pretty much untouched, except that they've added 3 new features; Themes, Yelp to Blinkfeed and Smart Widgets. \n- The smart widget looks poorly implemented. Various reviews have mentioned that it doesn't learn your app usage fast enough or doesn't learn at all. \n- Yelp on Blinkfeed is for me, a completely irrelevant addition. Don't use blinkfeed other than the occasional swipe through to see what's going on, but I mostly use RSS.\n- Themes look ok, but again, not something I'd be particularly interested in. I'd imagine I'd try it once or twice then not use it again.\nI can see why those features would appeal to consumers, but for me personally, I don't see Sense 7 being a significant improvement over Sense 6. \nSo they are my gripes with the M9 this time round. And the combination of those reasons will be why I won't be picking up the One M9. I get what you're saying, and maybe my expectations of the M9 were too high, but when you hear reports of the M9 camera performing worse and the battery life being worse than last year's phone, that's just not acceptable to me.", "time": "03-23-2015 09:20 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4301873", "text": "I'm a bit concerned about the Sense 7 UI lag on the M9.

Played around with each for a bit and was generally impressed with the build quality. I currently own an M8, and while there are some minor differences, it was pretty much the same phone to me. Though I will say it was easier to hold since it wasn't as slick as the M8 and the side power button is a welcomed change (even though I've gotten used to double tapping the screen to turn on my phone).\nSense 7 looks just like Sense 6, albeit more customizable options. I do like the option to add a 4th navigation button, and would definitely add the Notification menu button since it's always a stretch for me to reach the top of my phone and pull down with one hand. There's also the option to add a button to hide the navigation buttons, which gives you more more screen real estate.\nI did play a music video on YouTube and put the volume to max. Did the same thing with my M8, and in my opinion the M8 was definitely louder and had a richer, fuller sound. I mostly use headphone so it's not a big deal, but there have been times when I've watched videos in the car with friends, and the loudness/rich sound (and not even on the max volume) on my M8 always impresses, and everyone can hear with ease. So a little concerned there with the M9, especially since they \"upgraded\" to Dolby sound.\nI took a few pics, but it was a little hard to judge the quality since the phone was tethered to the counter, so couldn't really take a variety of pics, so it was hard to judge. Based on reviews I've read, though, I'm a little concerned with low light situations.\nWith all that said, I've been an HTC owner since the Evo 4G on Sprint. Following a year of ownership of that phone, I got an early upgrade to the Evo 3D. Kept that phone for 2 years and then went to the One M7. Paid full price last year for the M8 since I wasn't on an upgrade year, the primary reason being that the M7 wasn't a triband LTE phone on Sprint, and the M8 was. Been very impressed with the M8 thus far. I've been averaging about 18-20 hours of battery life, and for me the camera has done great, especially in low light situations.\nI was anticipating upgrading to the M9, but after the reveal and the reviews, I'm concerned with two things: battery life and camera (especially in low light situations). Also, knowing that my M8 will get Sense 7, it's getting harder and harder to justify; and I'm a tech lover and always love the newest and greatest.

The M9 will come with 5.0.2 out of the box, and I believe HTC has already made a statement that 5.1 isn't a big deal for M9 owners, since all of the new features it adds over 5.0.2 are things that Sense has supported for years, and they have included any necessary bug fixes into 5.0.2.

My impressions.", "thread": [{"postID": "post4301962", "text": "I just came back from a 15 minute play with the One M9, both the silver and gunmetal grey versions. The phone is released today here in Australia. Played with it at a Telstra store in Brisbane, Queensland.\nImpressions:\nBuild feels really solid. Doesn't feel like a cheap device at all. Then again, none of the HTC One's have. The finish is definitely has more grip than the M8. The finish on the gunmetal and silver are different also, which I hadn't read about. Silver felt more 'sticky' to my hands, whereas the gunmetal was smoother but not slippery or anything. Kinda hard to explain until you get hold if them yourself, you'll get what I mean. \nThe gold trim on the side of the silver model doesn't look too bad. It looks really gaudy in images and videos I've seen, but it's more understated in real life. The gunmetal is the same colour on the back and the side. If I had to choose, I'd probably go with the gunmetal, as the gold was enough to turn me off. Both looked decent though. \nThe front of the device is actually nicer and a bit cleaner than the M8. The M8 had two plastic inserts where the speakers are but the M9 is one continuous piece of plastic on the top, running down the sides to the bottom. It looks nicer than the M8 when I pulled it out and compared the two. I'd say the finish/grip of the back of the device is what makes the most difference in holding the M8 and M9. The M9 is definitely easier to hold without fear of dropping it. \nThe software looked extremely similar to what I have been using for the past year. Sense 7 looked and performed the same as Sense 6. Few little things I noticed was that on the gallery app, you can now pinch to collapse the images so you can see more of them, or expand to make the images larger. Kinda like what Apple have on their app and when you press the app drawer button, the background is now a dark blue instead of black. Not sure if that can be changed with themes, but those are some minor things I noticed. Software was fast and smooth. I wouldn't say it's leaps and bounds faster than the M8, but it felt a little bit faster. \nI snapped a few pictures inside the store. They turned out alright from what I could tell. Under artificial lighting, the images looked decent. I zoomed in on a photo I took and it looked fine, though photos always look better on the screen of a phone than when you look at it full size on a computer screen, so I'm holding off judgement on that.\nOverall impression is that it seemed very similar to the M8. Almost too similar for my tastes. While the build has improved (easier to hold), I can't say the software was new or refreshed or anything. More or less what we had with the M8 bar a few tweaks.\nI think going from the M7 to M9, that's a solid upgrade worth the price. Going from the M8 to M9....that's too hard of a call for me. It just didn't feel new enough or different enough for me to purchase it (and the $936 outright price helped with the decision). It's a really nice phone though. I think anyone who buys it will be pleased with it. I think the phone is best for those who don't have an M8, because then the upgrade will feel significant. To be honest, after reading all the doom and gloom reviews - my initial impressions of the phone are quite positive and thought it was better than it would be. Maybe I invested too much weight into reviews who tend to blow out the negatives. \nI'm happy to answer any questions people might have.

The design, audio, and camera (for the most part) of the M9 I have no problems with and I'm glad they made improvements where they did.

The M8 improved upon the M7 in a lot of things such as battery, camera performance, screen, speakers and it looks like the M9 improves on very little and in certain aspects, is actually worse than last years flagship. To me, that's quite disappointing. Especially since the HTC One M7 was such a breath of fresh air in the android space. In a sea of plastic, laggy phones, the One stood out as a truly high quality, great performing mobile. Can't help but think HTC have become complacent now. They were banging on about their dual tone finish on the M9, and that it takes twice as long to produce than the regular M8, but how does that really improve the device and would consumers really appreciate it? Seems like HTC have lost their focus, or they're trying to gimmick their way into sales. \nI can't help but think HTC may be focusing on other products such as the Re camera, Vive and their smart band?

There is no way that HTC can go back in and upgrade the camera without calling back the units they've already shipped and postponing launch another 2-3 months.\nAs for the camera, it's definitely meh. I was all set on getting the M9 until I looked at sample shots. I too have a nice (definitely not pro) camera, it's a compact mirrorless from Samsung. It takes shots that are definitely good enough for me, better than a point-and-shoot camera, and better than any smartphone. However, I am not allowed to take that camera into a concert, into a sporting event, and I'm not going to carry it with me everywhere. A high quality camera is as much of a feature, to me, as having an SD card (i.e. a requirement). HTC really dropped the ball with this. I was going to give the camera chance despite it lacking OIS.\nThe sample images I have come across on The Verge, Cnet, and various other sites leave a lot to be desired especially when compared to pictures taken with the Note 4 and iPhone 6 Plus (two of the best cameras in mainstream smartphones). I imagine the lack of OIS isn't helping HTC's case. Either way, the M9 is taking pictures that I don't want.\nSamsung's announcements didn't thrill me either and I'm not going to get the either S6 because an SD card reader is one of my requirements. Even with HTC not announcing a phablet, I was planning on getting the M9. Now I have to play the waiting game even longer.

To me, a flagship smartphone in this day and age should have OIS. Good images can be taken with smartphone cameras lacking OIS, the standard iPhone 6 is a good example of that. Even the S5 is a good example of a camera that can take nice shots and it doesn't have OIS. Having said that, HTC should have used a camera with OIS in their M9. The M8 had a cutting edge ultra pixel camera. Although the resolution count was too low (4MP), it was a step above and beyond that of regular smartphone cameras at the time. Why did they do the same thing with the M9? Instead they did what many manufacturers do: mindlessly up the MP count and call it a day. Adding OIS would have greatly added to the camera's functionality in the M9. Instead it's just a regular ol' smartphone camera now no different that what we have been using the past few years.\nOIS also helps when capturing fast moving objects like dogs and children. My fiance's Note 4 has OIS and after using it for a few months, I don't think I could go back to a camera without OIS. I've tried with my S5 but her Note 4 takes clear shots of our dogs while mine doesn't, her Note 4 takes clear shots at night while mine takes grainy shots with overblown colors.

The new S6 will have an F1.9 lens with OIS. \nHaving OIS will help tremendously when shooting in low light and with slow shutter speeds.

Or the rumors is part of some conspiracy?\n- - This may be true, but to me, the fact that the M9 gets that hot, when other devices are not as close, could cause an alarm to those who don't know how chips work.

The software definitely caused some nice debates regarding the camera to where software can't fix a hardware issue. \nI noticed you have an M8 as your daily driver. I utilize the M7 and M8 as my daily drivers. I did not start caring about the cameras on my phones until I started to actually take pictures this year. This is why I can't upgrade to the M9 if the camera isn't acceptable. Since the M8 will receive Sense 7 and the M8's camera is on par if not better than the M9, I won't be missing anything. Not to mention it really bothers me that HTC of all companies handed you a phone for you to review that was not \"finished\" yet. \nSome reviewers had a bad first impression of the M9. When they review the phone again close to launch time for the carriers I expect their views not to dramatically change. \nAs a huge fan of HTC, I really wish they would have consulted or collaborated with a company like Nokia or some other well known camera manufacturer. Just so they got it right the first time with the M9. I know in an ideal world, collaborating or consulting with a different company isn't always feasible and may cost lots of money. Needless to say, HTC hasn't been extremely profitable over the past few years.

With other models, they gimped the maximum bitrate of the video recording, thus leading to lower quality results, even though the hardware was more than capable.

More options with battery shape\n3. More physical space can be taken up by battery, rather than room for the battery\n4. More options for the physical location of the battery (under the screen for example)\n5. More onus on the OEM to use quality batteries - because they're replacing devices, not batteries if these things fail.\nIf the trade off to having to charge each night instead of hot swapping is worth it or not is up to the individual. My gut says that most people are charging every night either way. When it comes to batteries, we really need the focus to shift to batteries that last for many, many days or weeks - not measured in hours where some users are scrambling for chargers. Sealing off this compartment is a step (not a big step, but a necessary one) into allowing for that transformation.\nMicroSD support is one I'm personally thankful is not included, but I do understand that some people enjoy using that functionality. To me MicroSD will always represent a security and stability concern that doesn't exist otherwise, as well as a needless opportunity cost - every OEM that includes it is adding custom code to do so, carving out physical space and materials within the device, spending hardware and software engineering time, buying the parts, testing, etc. Even if that is only a few extra cents per device, 10 million devices in and that's some money that could have gone towards features in the device software or other benefits to more users. Again, obviously some people want THIS feature, not others. That's fine; I'm not one of them and most users are also not those users. It is smart for OEM's to play to the market(s), not to the forums. \nI will be sad if we get to a place where those options exist on no devices. I live in the US where these things aren't necessary for most users. In some markets, these options are both very necessary and should remain viable until they are not needed.

I don't want to get another Samsung phone running Android 4.4.4 only to experience another botched update.\nI think Vlad is spot on. Many people are prematurely judging the design of the M9 despite HTC saying that it would be more evolutionary than revolutionary. They were expecting a complete overhaul because they hyped themselves up for one. Vlad is also correct in that there wasn't much to improve with the M8. The camera was the first and foremost needed upgrade and, if the 20MP shooter has OIS, it will definitely be an upgrade over the M8's 4uMP camera. I was never really bothered by the slick back simply because my phones are always in cases and the M9 will be no different but a more textured back is still welcomed.\nI think a lot of people are having a pity party and are mad at HTC simply because they (the people) hyped themselves up for a huge design change. Even the S6 (and S6 Edge) aren't big design changes from the S5, that wasn't much of a design change from the S4, that wasn't too different from the S3, etc. HTC isn't the first company to release more iterative updates to their flagship smartphone and they won't be the last.\nThe only thing I'm disappointed with is the lack of a phablet from HTC. Then again, that disappointment is my own doing as I wanted to believe those Evaleaks so I chose to believe them.

I'm sure the G4 will be a fine smartphone but my S5 barely gets through a day on a single charge and that's with an extended 7500 mAh battery.

All of the Galaxy S updates were small and evolutionary, same with all of the Note updates. The biggest update to any of their smartphones came with the Note Edge and that was only after four years of having the Note released. So why can't HTC do the same thing? In fact, every smartphone manufacturer has done the same thing. Each update is not intended for people to get new phones every year especially when most people are on two year contracts and get new phones only when those contracts are up. No, smartphone updates now are for people to upgrade every other year. You will only ever see small updates when upgrading every year. Compare the S4 to the S5, there wasn't much of a difference in performance, camera quality, or anything else. Compare the S3 to the S5. Well yeah, that was a big leap in performance, battery life, camera quality, display quality, etc. Compare the M8 to the M9. It's not much. Compare the M7 to the M9. Again, there will be major leaps and bounds in performance (especially for 64-bit optimized apps).\nI'm not sure why you are hammering HTC for making an evolutionary update when every company (Samsung, Apple, LG, Google, Motorola, etc.) has only ever done that between each annual release. HTC's sales numbers may have decreased but that doesn't make them dead. They are still above and beyond BlackBerry. Even if HTC were to dramatically re-design the M9, I doubt it would make much of a difference. People are so caught up with brands now that they are either Apple or Samsung. Very few people know about HTC, Motorola (which used to be a household name), Sony BlackBerry, Microsoft, and Nexus phones. That doesn't mean that those other companies make bad products, far from it. They can still be successful in their own right without taking down Samsung or Apple.\nHTC's goal at this point is to sell more phones, not sell more phones than Samsung.

The difference is that HTC relied or marketing from Sprint, Verizon, Google, and some in-house but that was nowhere near what Apple was (and is) doing. Apple was also still riding the success wave of the iPod whereas HTC didn't really have anything prior except some budget PCs.\nThey had plenty of traction for a new smartphone company but they didn't have the pre-momentum or advertising of Apple. I'm not saying the iPhone is a bad phone but there were some people who bought it because of the marketing, because it was Apple, and/or because they liked their iPod. HTC didn't have any hit like the iPod line before making their first Android smartphone and they didn't have the multi-millions of advertising money.\nTheir scenario is completely different from Apple's and, if they could even match a quarter of Apple's ad revenue, I have no doubt they would be selling more. Samsung is number two in the U.S. for a reason and it doesn't have to do with the design is their phones (though that does play into account a bit), it has a lot to do with them advertising more (even directly against Apple, mocking them).\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "02-27-2015 11:31 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4258382", "text": "Very true.

It's a combination of the device, the OS, the service, the quality, their awesome returns policy, marketing and branding. \nAnd your description of the M8 looks and feel is contrary to a lot of other people and critics. That's fine if you feel that way, but I don't think that's how the general public would feel about it. \nIf sales were just based off looks, HTC would be among the top Android OEM's in sales.The M8 wasn't a monsterous seller. The general public don't even know what the One M8 is, so the One M9 looking the same doesn't matter - barely anyone will realise it's a similar design to a previous phone - and even if they did, it wouldn't necessarily be a negative.\nIf what you said was true, then Apple's 'S' model phones (4S, 5S) should have been rejected as rehashes by the public. Turns out the S models sold more than the non-S models (4S sold more than 4, 5S sold more than 5). So clearly, having the exact same design isn't the determining factor of success or not.\nAgain, the design isn't the issue for the M7, M8 or M9. It never was the issue. HTC's goal at the moment is to market and advertise the M9 aggressively so the general public will consider the HTC One when they want to buy a new flagship phone. They have the design and quality down pat. It's now about getting the message out there.\nHTC isn't banking on One M8 owners upgrading to the One M9. They're banking on bringing in more, newer customers as their major priority, then having those who purchased the M7 upgrading to the M9 when their 2 year contract runs out.

HTC didn't have any hit like the iPod line before making their first Android smartphone and they didn't have the multi-millions of advertising money.\nTheir scenario is completely different from Apple's and, if they could even match a quarter of Apple's ad revenue, I have no doubt they would be selling more. Samsung is number two in the U.S. for a reason and it doesn't have to do with the design is their phones (though that does play into account a bit), it has a lot to do with them advertising more (even directly against Apple, mocking them).\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "02-27-2015 11:31 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4258382", "text": "Very true.

I'm not in anyway disappointed in HTC, especially if the current videos/leaks are true and not the m8i or a joke from HTC to fool us. \nSo why am I disappointed in myself? \nBecause every year ALL of us at this time of the year look at everything we can about just what is coming out in our hobby. It doesn't matter if we are a fan of one product or manufacturer. We love the gossip. The leaks. The renders, the wallpapers, and some of us even like the fighting that goes on in the comment sections of some mobile sites. (thank you mobile nations/Android Central for cleaning up this wonderful site of all the bickering... It is much more enjoyable today then ever) \nBut I digress. I'm disappointed in myself because every year I tell myself that I shouldn't pay attention to the leaks. I remind myself that this is just part of the entertainment aspect of this hobby. And while it might be an exciting time to watch what is being leaked, that I should never take to heart any of the leaks or rumors as the are almost always fake. And normally I'm good. I'm almost never let down because I never care enough about some fake leak. \nLast year when the HTC m8 was announced I'll admit that I was disappointed with the camera. Not because of any leaks. But because I didn't understand why HTC would keep the 4 ultra pixel camera but ditch the OIS that clearly helped make the m7 one of the best low light cameras of its time. It was the only low point of the phone and I would have been proud of it regardless that we all wished for an 8 ultra pixel sensor instead (if only the m8 kept the OIS). \nTo be honest, I love my m8. It's redesigned back (as slippery as it may be) is awesome. The on screen buttons was sometimes a distraction when developers refused to remove it on some of my games (and let's not forget the YouTube bug in kitkat that never got fixed), but was welcome compared to the m7's odd button placement. Being able to turn on and off the screen using gestures was amazing in that I never had to use the power button! Let us also not forget the power of two front facing speakers when showing your family and friends a YouTube video or playing games on your Moga. Such boomsound design was even replicated on the NVidia shield tablet and more and more devices started having front facing speakers like the nexus 6 and Z3. In the land of phones HTC seems to have started something great and I'm glad that others may have added this feature. \nAbove all, Sence 6 regardless that it still didn't have a brightness slider in the notification shade was still the best skin on Android. It runs smother then stock, so what more could you ask for? I even liked blinkfeed so much that I never had to open up G+ ever again as most of the important updates from my favorite G+ accounts were then listed in it. Blinkfeed even listed one of my few entrys and a friend noticed it, so I know it works well even with social media. And.... Sence 6 has been so good to me that after a year, I still didn't slap a launcher on it. \nNow while I'm a big fan of HTC, I've seen the disappointment from the community about the Galaxy line of phones from Samsung always staying the same in design and materials. \nWhile I will always be a photographer, I briefly worked in marketing and I understand why Samsung never changed much from the S3 to the S5. And while the new S6 may have a new metal chassis, I still think it will have a plastic back (non removable). The look will ultimately be the same as the past as brand recognition is vital in selling your products. \nBut while I understand brand recognition, I never felt so disappointed in some stupid leak as I did today with the videos. It was gut-wrenching. And while I know that I should tell myself that this is fake and I shouldn't pay any attention to it, I just can't help but feel disappointment in that what we saw is not similar to what HTC did for the nexus 9. The thought that I could finally use the notification shade one handed again (without shifting my hand position) looks like it might not be happening and I'm devastated. \nMore importantly, I shouldn't be. After all, while I understand brand recognition, the current leaks might just be fake. Or it could be the m8i. Or it could be REAL. \nWhat ever it is, it will be disclosed in just a few more days. I hope by then that I'll be more pleased. As while I have never asked for change just for changes sake. I think it's time for HTC to wow us in design. For HTC to say look, you might be getting the same size screen, the same features, but our redesigned phone gives you an easier to use device that offers you louder speakers that most of you love and a design that will excite even the toughest of critics. \nI almost laugh at HTC's madlibs media campaign that they are using right now. But it has gotten the press to talk about them and that is needed badly. I'm also greatful for all the leaks, fake or real. It's entertainment, nothing more.

Then people woke up to a big shock that those renders could, could... Could be fake and not representative of the final product. Gasp!!!!!1!!!!one!!!! You're only digging a hole for yourself if you start getting self-hyped.\nPersonally, I'm not disappointed with the recent rumors regarding the M9's design. I was expecting more of an iterative update at this point with the 5\" M9. Apple has been doing it for years as has Samsung and even Sony. Major leaps and bounds aren't observed from generation-to-generation but rather every 2-3 years. I was disappointed with the lack of a phablet from HTC but you still never know what they will come up with on Sunday. Even if they don't release a phablet, I will strongly consider the M9 and likely end up getting one. I prefer HTC's Sense launcher/UI over TouchWiz (and I'll probably just install the Google Now Launcher anyway), the boom speakers will actually come in handy from time-to-time, and I kind of enjoy the taller design over shorter and wider phones. I really enjoyed playing with the M8 at Verizon a few weekends ago and I would enjoy an M9 if it followed a similar design.\nMy only holdout now is to see if the rear camera has OIS. That's a requirement for my next smartphone and I think HTC has learned their lesson after the M8's disaster of a camera (nice for low-light, it lacked detail for everything else).", "time": "02-25-2015 08:07 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4251560", "text": "I think its a human nature thing...Whenever something of interest is announced, you always wanna know about it.

Android Central had about 15 articles of the m7 after the review (and I'm not talking about the helpful ones that teach you how to do something like they do for every phone). I'm talking hype, not information. Heck, in the S4 vs the m7 camera shoot out, both phones were listed as a tie here on AC. The m7 was so promoted by most websites that it was crazy. Brian Clung from Anandtech wrote 3 pages on just the m7's camera alone. He also did a m7 vs S4 of the cameras, m7 won. The m7 was so promoted by everyone in the blogs and tech sites, yet it was not as refined a phone as the m8. Only the camera was better due to it had OIS. But you no longer had many of the original complaints in the m8, as other then the camera HTC listened to the consumers. \nBut no longer could the bloggers fool the audience with the ultra pixel camera. It was also bigger and some bloggers felt that due to the added screen size it was too hard to use one handed for some. The black bar didn't help with the audience, and while it had the cleanest and fastest UI as well as improvements in some areas, no longer did we see the drastically over the top promoting from all the websites like in the m7..... so the m8 didn't sell anyware near the m7 due to the more honest reviews and lack of extreme hype that followed the reviews that lasted for at least 7 months with the m7. \nI don't think that the m8 is broken. It is more refined then the m7 and the m7 was a great phone. but now what the m9 needs is not to tell me that McDonald's is down the street, it needs the next level of design refinement.

Not what is best or what your or my thoughts are. In fact reviews have little to do with sales in general. I could show you a phone or two with features that are from 2012 and it will out sell what ever phone you got this past fall due to heavy marketing. People don't buy the best phones in general, they buy what they are brainwashed into buying by advertising.

Just look at how the interest of the gflex 2 both pre and post reviews has drastically changed. Just look at how the forums are dead now.

In gaming and benchmarks, the m8 can beat not only the S5 and the G4, but also hang close with the 805 SOC phones that came out later in the year. It also flat out destroys the moto X in everything including battery life. And once you use boomsound speakers you'll never care about bezel size again. \nBut not only was HTC big on providing front facing speakers on a phone, but was also one of the first to have an IR Blaster to now turn your phone into a remote (not that Samsung didn't also provide this with the S4). plug in a high quality set of cans into the headphone jack and be amazed at how much better the quality is compared to all the competition. \nHTC is also the last maker of phones to have text reflow on Android. So if reading websites is important to you then you should look into this. \nAnd unlike most phones besides the moto X, HTC puts all their apps on the playstore so you never have to wait for a major update to get a bug fix or more features....no more waiting on carriers again. \nAnd let's not forget the fastest and most fluid UI on any phone including iphones and nexus devices.

Depending on when HTC finalized the design the marketing team could have had to use the M8 like design to show 'Hey, this is what we are thinking the ad should be like, do you like it?.' If HTC is like most other companies there is an insufferable level of approvals that have to happen for marketing stuff and it gets started really early, which is why I'd guess they budget some money to burn on stuff like that.\nThe retailers could also just made something up to slap on their websites, Spigen has a totally different render on their site after all, and I'd venture that the only people outside of HTC that know the true design are the carriers.\nAt this point we could come up with 50 different reasons for what the leaks show and won't until know until the 1st..

I wouldn't even like such a button if it was used to drop down the notification shade and better be an option and not standard and unremovable. \nHero, it took hours for me to calm down the last time. If this is real, I'm deeply disappointed in HTC.\nOr, this is a dummy phone and that is why it needs the extra on screen power button. I don't know. I could deal with no OIS on the camera.

The average consumer knows next to nothing about HTC and pretty much just focuses on iPhone and Samsung due to their marketing clout. For the most part, only us fans typically praise the brand. While many may like a similar design (referring to the fans) I'm guessing that most won't. Not because the M8 isn't a great looking smartphone, but mostly because HTC has to stop playing it safe and truly make a \"revolutionary\" phone if it wants to get more popular. Trying to \"fix\" last year's problems is not good enough. For example, looking at the most recent rumors, the M9 is basically appearing to be what the M8 should have been (better camera, slightly better battery life). And, the M8 ended up only being slightly better than the M7 (microSD, modified design). It's as if someone at HTC reads blogs AFTER their phone comes out and then just tries to fix some complaints with the next phone and leaves it at that - rather than trying to also improve on the phone in the process. \nIf the M9 ends up being what the recent leaks are saying, HTC will have a bad year and Samsung will get a sigh of relief having little to no real Android competition that's not a Nexus. Not because the M9 will be a bad phone (we all know it will end up being quite well regardless of how it looks), but because it's simply not a strong enough push forward when compared to their competition. Plus, it doesn't help that those leaked renders look so freaking sexy and everyone is basically on board with them.\nI'm sincerely hoping - for HTC's sake - that the renders end up being true and not the most recent leaks showcasing a thicker M8. To me, if you're going to keep the design the same, then the \"whole\" design needs to stay the same (including dimensions). At least that way I can keep my cases. But basically just making it thicker with the same look will irritate a lot of people.\nI'm really hoping for a surprise here because I want to see HTC succeed. We need companies like HTC to be bigger and not let the bigger dominate by being lazy and just having tons of marketing cash (looking at you Samsung).\nFor what it's worth: Spigen is showing cases and I find it interesting that they show some cases with the renders front and another with the recently leaked front: http://www.spigen.com/brands/htc/htc...e-capsule.html\nThis could mean we're looking at two different designs under the M9 brand or simply that they really just don't know yet what the front looks like.

Sense is awesome the way it is, though I'm sure they'll tweak it some. Still it's not perfect so here's what I'd like to see with the M9. Shorten it some for starters. The black bar is a bit much. Boomsound rules, so keep it. Maybe upgrade it a tad for clarity. Keep the 32 gigs internal with the SD storage. Screen bump slightly to 5.2 perhaps, MAYBE 5.5, if they can keep the bezels reasonable. Keep the ultra pixels. Yes, keep it. The duo camera too. It helps set it apart from the pack. However, it needs a bump to 8 mp, so you can actually zoom. And OIS has to be in there too. Snapdragon 805 clocked at say 2.8 would make it fly even better than the M8 with the 801. Let's go 3 gigs of RAM. Bigger battery to outdo Samsung and keep pace with LG would be smart. Say, 3000 mAh, maybe 3200 if possible, to give it killer battery life. And we can probably do without QHD, and stick with 1080p, and just bump the pixels, and refine color representation. But, I bet they go 1440 anyway, to keep pace with the market. And keep it light on bloat and only put features in there people will use. That's part of what makes Sense so great already. Outside of that, I can't think of much else.

The Desire 820 has one so I'm hoping they bring it over. I never touch it with the Dot View case on, but out of the case it is a bit of a stretch, and I would leave the case off more often if I could hit it without having to shimmy my finger across.\nI didn't say more megapixels, because it's too much of a common sense/natural progression change. They aren't going to stay with 4MP for the third year in a row, and I remember an interview with one of their camera engineers saying that they thought 8MP is ideal, and that's where they wanted to get to. I personally don't want anything over 13MP right now; 8MP alone is usually overkill. When you start reaching 13+ the only real benefit is cropping, and that's because (in most cases) optical zoom isn't there for varied focal lengths. (So try to find a way to include another zoom level without drastically increasing the size.) What I'd want from the camera is the purple fringing gone, and more consistency. The camera isn't terrible, it just ranges from great to pathetic. I can take three pictures of the same thing and 2/3 will be acceptable, but all three will look different.\nThe black bar doesn't really bother me either. I like having someplace I can rest my thumb. The screen is so sensitive that I can actually hit the on screen buttons from only the very tip of the black bar. If they got rid of it completely I can see myself accidentally activating the buttons all the time. I'd like it if they made it smaller; if they did something like fit a slightly larger screen in the same height and a smidge wider, but I don't think it'll be gone completely. It seems most likely that they'll follow the Desire 820, and make all the bezels a smidge smaller, rather than chunk out a whole portion they've been using for two years, and X amount of devices.\nSomething less likely to happen, but that I'd want is a dedicated camera key. Having one is just so nice. Being able to just press it to go into the camera would be so much easier than having to hold the phone landscape and press a volume key, which is both slow and never works unless I'm holding the phone perfectly horizontal. And you could do it with the screen already on, since trying it right now just ya know turns the volume down.\nProbably the only other hardware change I'd like to see is an improvement with the speakers. \"Make them sound better\" or \"make them louder,\" which would be great, but that's not what I mean. When you get further and further away from the speakers, the quality of what you hear drops off, and that's what I'd like improved. Physics is limiting it, but make listening from 10 feet away closer to what you'd hear from 4 feet. It sounds great up close, but the bigger the distance, the more hollow it seems.\nThought of something else: have some sort of grip or texture on the sides. The phone is slippery, and even though it's gotten less slick as time went on, it's still slippery. They don't have to mess with the entire phone, just the sides you clamp your hands or fingers on. The lines on the sides could be extended to cover the area inbetween and given some texture without redesigning the whole thing. Or it could be styled like the Droid DNA grilles. Some really good color combinations could be made from that instead of all blue or all red.\nWith software, having Motion Launch to turn off the screen would be great.\nMore themes, or being able to customize the colors would be good too.\nAnd please for the love of all that is good with gravy, take away the clock in the status bar if you have a clock widget, or at least the stock HTC clock widgets. And in the lockscreen. It's redundant to have a clock in two places at once. Nexus 7 doesn't have two on the lockscreen. You don't need two. Open up that space for something else like more notifications or so it doesn't look like an entire row of crowded icons.\nAnd most importantly, keep what made the M7 and M8 great.

Snapdragon 810 sounds great, 3gb ram is great. Only thing that caught me off guard is 5\" 1080p display. I would have assumed the screen would have been QHD, but hey, I'm happy with going with 1080p. Just means better on battery to me, and 5\" is fine. Kinda don't want to get a 5.5\"+ device. 2,840mah battery is fine to me if the screen is 5\" and 1080p. No issues for me there. To me, there isn't a real tangible benefit of going to a 1440p panel. And it would be less apparent on a 5\" screen. Kudos to HTC if they do stick to a 1080p panel. Though I wouldn't mind maybe a 5.2\" -5.5\" jump in screen size.\nAlso interesting that Upleaks says that it's not the M9, but the next flagship is Hima. Not sure if that means a change in design philosophy or just a change in name. \nOne thing that I'm not 100% sure about is the camera. 20.7mp camera suggests to me it'll be the same (or similar) camera module on Sony's Xperia phones which I'm not terribly excited about.

In fact every time I try to see if HTC made a mistake and should have left capacitive buttons on the bar, it just felt uncomfortable and to low to use. \nSence 6 has been a dream and is far welcomed after a year on touch wiz. The text reflow in the stock browser is always missed every time I use a different phone, and I'm so glad when I'm back with my m8. \nThe speakers are not much louder then say my s4 (work phone), but are much clearer and work so much better in my moga while gaming. \nAbove all, the ui is super smooth. Far faster then most others out today... Even the nexus 6 with stock android seems to not be as smooth sometimes. I also think that Google stole its material design from HTC in some cases. Just look at blink feed on the m8 and then at the new updated YouTube or lollipop and tell me that the look isn't similar. \nOnce again I'd like to try something different then HTC. I almost went with the G3 as the formfactor fit so well in my hand. But the hardware seemed to low for it and what I would be giving up in return wasn't worth it to me. Maybe if it had an 805 in it like the note 4, I may have jumped. The note 4 on the other hand is slightly too big for me, and I don't need a screen higher than 1080p for my ui no matter what the size of the screen is... Unless the ui is truly stutter free, and both the G3 and the N4 can't say that (although the note 4 has it less them the G3, they both have it to a small degree). \nWhile I still say that there is no perfect phone for everyone, this is the first year that I didn't at least test something for a week to replace my m8. \nAfter all, the m8 is not perfect. It is slightly large for a 5 inch screen, and it is heavy in the hand compared to the s4 that I still use. But other than the G3, nothing has really gotten my attention to give up my daily driver. Not even the beta nexus 6 holds a candle to the m8 in my book. \nBut what about the black bar you say? What black bar? I never notice it with daily use. Even my friends never notice it when using my phone, and no one has even mentioned it. \nThis is a phone forum geek complaint, nothing more.
