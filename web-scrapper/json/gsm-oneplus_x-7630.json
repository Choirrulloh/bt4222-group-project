So OPX ended up with Marshmallow Android (6), but I don't think that's a bad thing. This system is actually pretty stable and without any flaws (I did not experience any so far). If numbers are what you seek (eg. to always have \"highest\" Android version in \"About phone\" screen, then buy Nexus/Pixel). Alternatively you can use 3rd party ROM such LineageOs/CyanogenMod - they managed to port and rework GPU libraries needed to run Nougat on Snapdragon 800/801 processors, so you can have Nougat (and I personally expect in future Oreo as well) on OPX too.  \r\nI own this phone and I am happy with it. It's kinda bulky and heavy, but considering it is all glass and metal, I should not have anything against it. I had only one problem so far on this phone - for some reason, if haptic feedback is enabled (vibrations), then SwiftKey keyboard (which I use a lot) tends to ignore key touches till vibration of previously pressed character ends. That means that if you are a \"fast writer\", you can end up with text you did not want to write (because of missing characters it might turn into unreadable cipher). Easy solution how to prevent this problem is to use another keyboard (like Gboard from Google) or turn off vibrations in SwiftKey settings. Then it's a perfect phone. :)", "date": "25 Sep 2017"}, {"text": "Worst phone as ever i used dont think to update any operating system if you are a busy person amd get only time in weekends , cause update that they provide is only full of unesary  bug .

(approx. 200MB/s read speeds) i am greatful they included a microsd slot which allows us to have the photos/videos we take saved onto there... Apps can be moved to that storage as well. \r\nthe read/write speed of the microsd are quite... on the low end (slow end?)... i found it to not even be capable of reaching 30MB/s read and top out at approx. 20MB/s on the write.... even though i have a card that should reach 80MB/s+ read speeds .... could it be a driver issue? maybe hardware? *shrugs* \r\nnot a deal breaker, but other phones, with same card, perform much closer to rated specs.\n \r\nbattery is not too bad and has been consistent for me. i get roughly 1hr25min (+/- 10min) screen on time for every 30% battery drain. so theoretically i should get about 4.25-5hours screen on time before my battery forces the phone off.\n \r\noverall phone is great, just wish the company would push their devs to update this phone quicker to fix bugs and performance issues that can occur...

Personally I dont play all that much so it doesnt really matter to me. Ive  also noticed a lot of software related issues being mentioned here. Now i know that the OxygenOS 2.2.0 rolled out a couple of days back, n it claims to have addressed most of the common issues (adding manual mode to the camera, choosing sim when calling, allowing the transfer of apps to ext sd card....).  \r\nHave any of u folks had major issues AFTER 2.2.0? ", "date": "28 Jan 2016"}, {"text": "  I am a genuine Oneplus x cell phone user, 3days back I updated the OS as launched but the thing is, there are still several bugs as follows:- \r\n1) dual sim problem - even though selecting \"ask      every time\" option for out - going calls, its taking only 1st sim. \r\n2) there is no end call notification for data on/off - that black dail box saying xyz kB/MB is consumed. \r\n3) I found non periodic vibrations during in call - I am damn sure its not for minute remainder. \r\n4) there is no manual flash on/off option for camera to click pictures in \"photo\" mode - but its there in video mode. \r\n5) there is no face detection, smile detection options in settings - auto focus doesn't work only. \r\n6) there is no minute remainder in call settings option. \r\n7) there is no video call n call recorder option in dialing launcher. \r\n8)  if I remove the Google search bar, the menu entry is malfunctioning by giving recent used apps. \r\n9) in sim settings, we can only have the access to modify the sim name, but not accessible to put our sim number (i.e,948*******). \r\n10) there is no one click exit (x - mark at the top of all recently opened apps) option to exit the apps that are running at background.", "date": "28 Jan 2016"}, {"text": "Same here.

After installing few apps what I got as user space is just 8GB which I think is very less.\n \r\n2. There is a google search bar by default on home screen, which you just can't remove.\n \r\n3. There are lot of bugs in the phone software, for example it happened twice with me that I had to unlock phone to answer call. \n \r\n4. It doesn't show notifications on app icons, for example if there are 20 unread messages in whatsapp, it doesn't show the number on the icon.\n \r\n5. There is no email client available, you need to install it. I installed outlook free version, but still not able to configure it. I used email in my previous phone S5 with same settings, so this also look some issue with phone only.\n \r\n6. Battery backup is also not so good, I have to charge phone twice a day with even very less usage.\n \r\nSo overall phone is total crap, the only thing which I am looking forward now is 3GB RAM.
