Its lightweight but still pretty solid for the material. Now as for the actual design of the product, paired with the processor and the fact that it seems to get pretty warm pretty quick, I have had some bad luck with the phone. I had the phone for about 4-5 days and used it relatively lightly, with the exception of streaming videos and your basic games. I noticed the phone would get really warm really quick. Upon flipping the phone over to check the back I noticed what seemed to be a scratch, which was odd as I have not taken the phone out of a case or even put it in my pocket with anything before a case was on it. So a couple more days went by and I noticed more \"scratches\". Now this seemed very weird. Upon looking into it further I noticed a bulge in the lower central part of the phone and the \"scratches\" were appearing bbetween the cloud logo, where the phone reached its hottest, and the bulge. So I reached out to Nextbit and they advised I get a replacement sent, which I did, however I noticed upon receiving the replacement there seems to be the same odd bulge in the same location as my previous phone. The stress marks kept growing on the old phone, and now it has me worried that the new replacement will be doing the same thing. I have attached some pictures of the stress marks on the phone before I sent it back to have it for documentation. \n\r\nIt's sad as I really enjoy the snappiness of the phone and the design of both the hardware and OS however I just think the phone could have been tested a bit more before being put out to production. Overall its a pretty solid phone and for the price point on amazon ($299) is a plus.", "time": "23rd June 2016, 05:27 AM", "postID": "post67445204", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Ergonomics (in-hand feel)", "rating": 4.5, "links": ["https://forum.xda-developers.com/nextbit-robin/review/ergonomics-hand-feel-t3317691"], "threads": [{"text": "While the Nextbit Robin looks too geometrical for comfort, it's not the case since it has generous rounded corners.

Additionally, the top and bottom of the Robin (The 2nd color - mine being the blue of the electric) makes the phone much longer and rectangular, this with the boxiness makes it much more easier to type out messages on the Robin compared to more curved smartphones such as the HTC 10.
