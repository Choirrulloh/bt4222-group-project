Checking the camera samples in GSMArena hands on article of the Samsung Galaxy S7 & S7 Edge at MWC 2016 and comparing the camera samples of the S7 now, there seems to be significant degradation in camera quality which could be due to Samsung intentionally pushing out destructive OTA update under planned obsolescence policy to highlight their current and upcoming generations of flagship phones.. It could be a differentiating factor considering the S7 & S8 have similar camera quality, although slightly better on the S8 because it's the current flagship, soon to be succeeded by the upcoming S9. This is what I noticed after a lot of camera sample analysis. Tried Google Pixel HDR+ Mod for the S7 and it didn't offer any significant improvement over the stock camera app except a little better exposure on a sunny day in HDR+ mode on the rear camera. After several months of usage, the battery backup doesn't seem as good as it was when new. Maybe it could be due to continued fast cable charging or could also be due to planned obsolescence.. Pretty happy with frequent Security updates but Samsung is slow upgrading their phones which is understandable due to feature rich Samsung Experience UI on top of Android and vast product portfolio but come on, this is a flagship phone. We S7 users are still stuck on Samsung Grace UX when budget & midrange Samsung phones like J7 2016 & On8 etc got update for Samsung Experience UI. Even the S8 Oreo update was suspended.. Android 8.0 Oreo is messed up and buggy, Essential skipped 8.0 Oreo update for 8.1 Oreo.. Hope Samsung will also skip Android Oreo 8.0 update to directly provide Android 8.1 Oreo update to the S7 pretty soon.  Until then, it's a long cycle of waiting.. Not a loyalist of any brand.

Also the argonomics on the oneplus 3 were much better... And personally, I find 5.5 inches screen as good...\n \r\nScreen, \r\nScreen is good, very crisp and very easily visible even under direct sunlight... Just outstanding\n \r\nBattery and charging, \r\nThis is where the biggest disappointment is... The battery was good when I bought the phone, but as it has aged, the battery life is decreasing... Infact, whenever the screen is at 2k, it sips battery like crazy... I have to charge the device almost 2-3 times if I use it very extensively... Also when kept on 2k, the device tends to heat a bit and that too with moderate usage... Things improve with 1080p but what's the use if you cannot really use the device's maximum potential... \n \r\nCharging speeds are a bit slow, coming from a dash charging enabled device it feels very slow... But its okayish, also it charges very fast after 70%, fast as compared to others...\n \r\nSoftware and UI experience, \r\nI'm kind of disappointed with this, I used to have a galaxy note 3 years back and at that time the features it provided were great amd provided by none in the market, the features are same and almost nothing new is added... That disappoints me a bit, because I expected more... Also the UI isn't mature enough, the oneplus 3 had a lot of customisations, the S7 being a samsung flagship isn't that great... \n \r\nOne small thing I love about this device is, that if you have a password set, so without unlocking the phone, you cannot toggle the mobile data, wifi or the location on/off... Even you cannot switch the device off... Only you can restart the phone... So that's a good safety measure by samsung because you can always track your phone...\n \r\nCamera \r\nThe camera is good, it captures great images, low light photography is also good but now as everyone is heading towards the dual camera and the portrait mode thing, the camera feels outdated... Strangely the video I used to shoot with the oneplus 3 at 1080p 60fps felt a lot smoother than the one with this device... But one thing about samsung devices is that, the front camera is exceptionally wide angle and it makes selfies more easy as you don't have to strech your hand much... \n \r\nSpeaker, earpiece sound quality etc, \r\nThe speaker is okay but is tinny and lacks bass, adequately loud... Could be better, but can be considered as this device has waterproofing... \n \r\nEarpiece is very loud and clear and during the calls, the minimum volume of the speaker and the maximum volume of the earpiece almost match...\n \r\nBut the sound quality from the audio jack is very low, even at maximum volume the sound doesn't feel loud, even in silence I had to keep the volume upto more than 70% to make it sound clearly audible... This is a very big disappointment because even budget phones have better audio quality than this...\n \r\nAging/issues \r\nAs I had upgraded it from the oneplus 3, the day I bought it I felt meh... I agree that the camera quality in the night is exceptional but apart from that there's nothing great about this handset... The day light shots almost feel equal if compared with the op3... And one thing I noticed is that, I had the oneplus 3 for almost 10 months and even after 10 months it used to feel very snappy... Whatever I threw at it, it handled it with ease... But I don't feel the same with the S7, and I've just used the phone for 3 months... \n \r\nTalking about the issues, my gallery app isn't showing me old photos, whenever I click on the old photos, it just stops responding, same happens sometimes even with chrome and Instagram, I had tried cleaning the cache but that doesn't help either... I never had these type of issues with my op3... But both of my samsung phones, the note 3 and the grand 2 had similar type of issues... \n \r\nThe auto brightness sensor also doesn't feel well callibrated... The brightness is sometimes more and some less than what it should be... It doesn't detect the ambient light that well... And one thing I noticed, that if you have a light source right behind you it cranks up the brightness and you just can't lower it... If you try adjusting it, it just cranks up again with my op3 if I set the brightness manually, then it would remain at the same brightness until I manually toggle the brightness on/off... And that was good...\n \r\nSomething I love in this device is the vibration.motor, it is so finely tuned that I have toggled everything on that needs vibration... I enjoy it... \n \r\nFinal word, \r\nAs 2018 is on the way and there will be a hell lot of new smartphones launching in 2018, I would strongly suggest not to buy this smartphone at this time... Because the oreo update will be the last one to hit this device and that too in late February or early march... And after that, there will be nothing special left in this device... It doesn't have a dual camera, so no potrait mode and now as we are watching even the budget segment with potrait mode that will be a major hit if you buy this...\n \r\nAlso the samsung UI, I don't know how the Samsung experience is, but it feels similar to touchwiz, so I would strongly recommend to stay away from phones running touchwiz, because the UI isn't worth your hard earned money... Yes, it does have a bunch of sensors like the heart rate etc, but in a busy life you will hardly care about them.being present... \n \r\nSamsung will really spoil their game if they won't work on their UI...

Even in pro mode with ISO set to 50 or 80, there's visible noise especially in the corners. Noise is also visible in the viewfinder if you crack up the brightness. This wasn't the case with the camera before the October level Android security patch update. The S7 & S8 have similar camera quality so Samsung has intentionally screwed the camera quality on the S7, as part of planned obsolescence to frustrate the users enough so we buy their new flagship phones.

But camera performance in low-light and artificial lighting condition is degraded after the update.

S7 is the best smartphone I've ever owned. S7 is superior in every way to the XZ - from the design, screen, camera, audio quality, battery life, to the user interface and software features. \n \r\n- XZ is ridiculously big and bulky for a 5.2-inch phone. It's as big as the S7 edge already with 5.5-inch display. S7 is smaller, thinner and easier to hold and, unlike the XZ which has sharp edges, S7 has rounded edges which make its more manageable and it can even be used single-handedly. \n \r\n- S7's screen is amazing. It's bright, has vivid colors, great contrast, deep blacks which is typical of AMOLEDs and is even perfectly legible outdoors. With the latest Nougat update, you can even set the display resolution to 1080p or 720p. XZ has oversaturated colors for an IPS LCD display, and 1080p is not flagship-grade.\n \r\n- Touchwiz also looks nicer and more consistent than Xperia launcher. S7 also has so much more software features than XZ like Always-On Display, Private Mode, etc. I was also very happy to find out that the fast-charger is included in the box with S7. And there is even a software feature to enable and disable fast charging.\n \r\n- S7's camera UI and hardware are jampacked with features - 4k, OIS, phase detection, slow motion video, different cool image and video modes that you can apply. Not to mention both the image and video qualities are excellent, and S7 doesn't overheat AT ALL when recording 4k video until you run out of memory. XZ's camera features and quality just pales in comparison.\n \r\n- S7's mono speaker quality is surprisingly louder than XZ's dual speakers. The audio quality via 3.5mm jack is also loud unlike in the XZ.\n \r\n- S7 also has great battery life. Lasts a whole day for heavy use, and can last up to 3 days for moderate use. XZ has horrible battery life.\n \r\nS7 is a perfect all-rounder. It's a perfectly-sized phone. Not too big and not too small. It's a perfect work of engineering. And it's complete. Everyone will find everything they look for in a smartphone in S7. XZ lacks so many features both hardware and software. Even the accessories that come with XZ in the box are not complete.

I can hear a Samsung spokesperson pointing at an incompatible app. Errors such as 0x80071AC3, occur during copying, and that has never occurred on my previous phones. Corrupted data prevents you from copying your photo folders. Once a corrupted file is encountered, file copying stops, and you have to figure out where that corrupted file is located. Deleting corrupt files on the microSD card has not always worked. Running the DiskCheck application didn't fix the problem either.

Also, the transparent plastic cover of the flash and heart rate monitor seems to be easily scratched. I had to use some toothpaste and tissue paper to remove those scratches.\n \r\nI suggest you buy one of those spigen slim or rugged armor cases to protect your phone. Get their steinheil curved screen protectors too. Get a high-speed and capacity SD card and you got one hell of a phone.\n \r\nCamera is one of the best. I had to shelf my Canon DSLR for this one if I'm going on a tour somewhere. Focus is really fast.\n \r\nBattery life is so-so. Just remember to get one of those 15,000 mAh powerbanks if you're going on a long trip without any outlets available. Battery lasts at around 8 hours with the wifi/mobile data on and frequent music playing and camera use. \n \r\nI had a Samsung S4 and an iPhone 5s before I had this one. Games are super fast. It also really heats up when you use fast charging and cover it with a pillow, so I suggest turning off fast charging if you're gonna leave it overnight plugged in.\n \r\nIt'll also head up considerably when you use your VR headset. By the way, this is not the Note 7. People would often stereotype this phone as the one that explodes.\n \r\nWaterproofness is an added bonus. Just becareful not to charge it after giving it a dip. Also, the speakers will be unusable for quite a while until it completely dries off.\n \r\nOverall, it's a nice phone by itself.

After being with I Phone for the last 8 years, taking a decision to move my heart to Samsung didn\u00c2\u0092t come with ease. It was my son who talked much about the new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and he lured me into it. After having looked at the phone for couple of times, I took a quick decision to go for it and bought the same from Carrefour, Marina Mall, Abu Dhabi, UAE. \n \r\nI felt the decision was a right one until the morning of 1 June 2016 where my eyes were taken aback by the sight of unclear display screen with green haze marks and some lines over it making the display blurred and invisible. \n \r\nIn despair I rushed to the retailer and showed him the phone. He looked at the same and said he needs to send this for repair. Repair??? A phone which is just two months old and now need to be opened for repair. Is this the Samsung .. a revolutionary phone, making people rething what a phone can do? This is ridiculous. I am suffering of the rethinking phone after having spent my hard earned money on this. The person there at the store immediately got into making his paper formalities for sending this to service centre. He didn\u00c2\u0092t even disable the apps in the phone or reset the phone. The Sim was removed and given to me and I was telling him that I need to reset the phone as the same has some of my bank details and some passwords etc. The boy didn\u00c2\u0092t bother about it and left me with managing the reset , where I had to put the SIM again and then operate to reset. There goes the phone with absolute darkness on the display and I don\u00c2\u0092t even know whether this is reset. As you read now, the phone is still in darkness mode and I have no idea whether this is reset or is dead forever. \n \r\nI am now left with no option than live with this handiocapped phone which makes people rethink what a phone can do? \n \r\nI wish the CEOs of Samsung look into the nitty-gritty of how this phone is and a phone of this standard and grace is never expected to cause problem in the first two months. I uncderstand if the repair is to be done after one year of usage. Now, this is worse than a murder. \n \r\nI am now back again with my good old I Phone.

Example; my old Palm Plug!!!!. Others showed up the battery scale as working the same as the so-called \"fast charger\", ok, some didn't, but a few DID!. Just total B.S., The big issue? with my S5, I carry 3 extra batteries with me in my bag at all times. When walking around the city all day, using GPS, i go through 3-4 batteries. With my S5 i just pop another in at about $10 each.With the S7, you are stuck with buying a back up battery charger, that will take maybe....30 minute s to charge.

Is it necesary? No its not, most people will check their facebook write a few tweets watch some youtube videos maybe play a game in their spare time and even take some photos here and there thats about all really when it comes to usage so there isnt any need for 4gb of ram or the fastest chipset on the market. \n \r\n  The return of the sd card however is a great step forward as the galaxy s6 had a big sale loss due to the limited storage.  \r\n  The water and dust resistance i guess is a big bonus considering samsung last had this feature on the galaxy s5 which till today i believe is the best galaxy on the market.\n \r\n  The camera on the other hand has been downgraded to 12mp with the promise that it is much better in low light due to its pixels being bigger therefore capturing more light... but at what price losing detail in your images especially for someone who wants to print their photos and have them put up on the wall this could be an issue. So is the camera an upgrade? Yes and no. Better night shots but less detail in the day.

The S2 was a significant improvement over the first S. The S3 was just as significant over the S2 with things like smart alert, smart stay, pop-up player (have the video in a separate window while performing other tasks) etc. Then the S4 took things to a whole new level with features from the Samsung Smart TV and Galaxy Note 2 (Smart Scroll and Air View respectively) but the cool part about the Air View is that while the S-Pen was needed to do it on the Note 2 a pen wasn't needed to get it done on the S4...Samsung revamped the entire screen just for the Air View to work without a S-Pen...that's innovation.\n \r\nThen along came the S5 with more innovations most notably the first smartphone to come with a heart rate sensor and the first Galaxy S to have a fingerprint sensor...that's innovation...and it's impressive to know that it is water resistant without it being the bulky active version...that too is innovation. Most impressively the S5 was able to maintain every feature from every previous Galaxy S (except the FM Radio which got cut since the S4). I only used the radio once on my S2 just to test it out so I won't cry about it being gone these days.\n \r\nThe S6 removed essential stuff like the SD slot and Ingress Protection and sealed the battery to top things off. That's not innovation. The S7 brings back the SD slot and Ingress Protection but removes the IR blaster  (infaRed) yet everybody jumps for joy. That's not innovation. Removing a feature from one model and bringing it back in another model is NOT innovation. \n \r\nSamsung has clearly ran out of ideas. I will stick to my S5 octa-core. It has everything including a removable battery which has sadly been gone since the S6. I guess I will have to wait to see what the S8 has to offer.

You told the story well, though I overlooked the tv part. I have a HD TV and I totally forgot that at full HD photos are 2MP (give and take) as you put it. In fact it's a little less than some rated 2MP cameras because 2.4MP cameras have a resolution of 2048x1152 and they are still listed as just 2MP while a flat 2MP is resolution is 1600x1200...either way you take it though a 1080p HD TV have to be seen as a 2MP resolution.\n \r\nI have always preached that if you aren't going to print a big poster or a billboard sized poster then 2MP is sufficient for most snaps. For my working purposes I snap photos at 2.4MP (that's the lowest resolution of my S5) and for other purposes I shoot photos at 6MP. Unless I go into the a real advertising business I will never have a need for anything more than 6MP (second resolution option on my S5 after 2MP) so even the 12MP of the S7 is a overkill just like the 16MP of the S5 was a overkill.\n \r\nMany persons think that megapixels equals better photos but it's really the optics/lens that produce the quality...megapixels help in the large printing area and for zooming in purposes on a computer etc.\n \r\nMy S2 had 8MP and for the most part I didn't shoot photos at that resolution. Furthermore high-resolution photos fill up your memory very quickly whether internal or external and I won't even get started with HD video recording. 720p is enough for me. 1080p and UHD will make you spend money on memory cards faster than how you spend money on food.\n \r\nHaving said all that it's always better to have more features than less features because even though they may not be used for the most part, you can never tell when there will be that moment when you need to have the absolute best (like a rare one in a million moment).", "date": "22 Feb 2016"}, {"text": "Bold statement only being February 10 more months to go  ", "date": "22 Feb 2016"}, {"text": "Get a Note 4 and save some money the Note 4 is still great ", "date": "22 Feb 2016"}, {"text": "I'm not impressed, LG G5 all the way.", "date": "22 Feb 2016"}, {"text": "Go with s7", "date": "22 Feb 2016"}, {"text": "Should I get the Note 4 or getting the S7 ?

When using a external memory card it slows the phone down dramatically. 3. When you save files IE photos, music, videos or documents they can become corrupt, less dense (In short photos become blurry, music become distorted, document can actually be changed if saved because the phone may not have the same format that document  is in) or even you files can be lost. Another thing to consider is the design of the phone, now they dont have plan for a somewhat large slot it may not seem large to you but for a thin device it is.\n \r\nWith that in mind I am not saying an external memory card isnt worth it but it does cause issue that many of us deal with, again thats slow phone, the safety of our files and the overall shape, size and style of the device. Samsung will more than likely still ahve the same option to have a 100GB free online storage option, which in my eyes is much safer because it isnt stored on something I could lose or even break and not get back my info again. I dont work for Samsung but i know they keep the customer in mind when making these device for example S6 was made all by consumer reactions and preference giving us more power than ever before.\n \r\nNow for other who need an external memory either to move files from or to your device they make a special reader for your phone to connect many different types of storage device medias and they are relatively cheap and im saying less than $10 on amazon.\n \r\nSo i hope with this I helped you a bit to understand the motives of what Samsung is doing and how they are still giving people the power they want and the serious smart phone that we need.
