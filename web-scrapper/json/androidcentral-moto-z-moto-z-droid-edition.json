If anyone's after a bargain I'd definitely recommend having a browse on the Moto website I'm in the UK I'm sure there are similar deals elsewhere. I paid \u00a3299 and got a free style shell, I would have also got a free JBL mod but they'd ran out.\nSo there's the deal now for the gripe.\nWhy don't phone manufacturers sell phones already updated with the latest software released for that phone!!! I understand if you buy from a carrier they could have had it for a while in stock but directly from the manufacturer it should be up to date. I've just received my Moto Z and from what I can tell it came with the software it was originally released with and I'm currently going through the update process I've been at it for nearly three hours with all the other setups and about 5 software updates so far it's some task setting up a new phone.", "time": "06-22-2017 02:35 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5859935", "text": "Congratulations on your Moto Z \nEnjoy it! \nYou may find that the Moto Z you got is part of old stock, that's why it has the older software and has to he updated.

I have a 2+ year old Droid Turbo that I love, but the battery life isn't what it used to be and I am considering an upgrade.\nThe Moto Z Play sure looks awesome as battery life is very important to me. Battery size and efficiency in the power consumption have me impressed. Hardware spec wise though it seems pretty lateral from my old Turbo. No build in wireless charging is a bummer. Of course I could always add the battery mod for crazy life and wireless, but there reaches a limit when it comes to thickness and weight of the phone that I want to deal with.\nHowever, the Moto Z hardware specs are nicer than both the Z Play or my Turbo. So it has me wondering. How does the Moto Z with the Incipeo battery mod compare to the Z Play (no battery mod)? I do like the wireless charging that I could get with the Incipeo as that is a huge plus that I love about my old Turbo.\nHas anyone done any battery performance comparisons of the Z w/ battery mod (4800 mAh combined) vs the Z Play (3510 mAh) stand alone?

So adding a Battery mod would push those numbers to Z Play numbers, but the Z is pushing 1440p while the Play only pushes 1080p. \nRight now it's all up to price and feel. The Z Play is going for $450 new at most online places, while I found a new Z for $499 on Amazon. \nI love both devices and if I could handle multiple phones at once the Z would be #1 and the Play #2 . \nThe Z will be a little bit more future proof with the 820 and 4GB of RAM and a quicker update schedule, vs the 625 and 3 GB.\nTL;DR - You won't go wrong with either", "time": "03-28-2017 04:08 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5729252", "text": "Wireless Charging-only Moto Mods are coming soon.", "time": "03-28-2017 12:57 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5751621", "text": "Sounds like fun to me", "time": "04-09-2017 06:23 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5800223", "text": "I ended up buying the Z Play Droid a few weeks ago.

I could have got the Z for not much more money, but my instincts were for the Z Play and I'm happy with that for now. \nThe battery is incredible, particularly after the poor battery life on the S6. I would bet it's not just battery capacity but the problem of a 1440p screen though. I thought I might feel the loss of the resolution, but the Z Play's 1080p screen is pretty nice: no problems there. (Sidenote - I don't really trust wireless charging. I've had it on phones in the past, and it makes your phone hot. It's not a dangerous temperature on paper, but I don't like the idea of slowly weakening my phone over time like that, and for what? Slow, inefficient charging. Better to have enough charge to get through the day so that wireless is never a requirement.)\nCamera isn't as good as the Z. It's passable, but a step down from my old S6. \nBuild quality is great on the Z Play too imo, but you will need a case (glass is not shatterproof). \nCPU/GPU is behind the Z but not in ways that become apparent to me. I use a lot of apps, but not games. I hear it's games that show the difference between the two. Again, the lower spec chips are to the Z Play's advantage, helping it to use less power.\nThe Z Play is a very heavy phone. If that's an issue, you might prefer the option of the Z + mod. \nFor me, the Z Play was the one. We just had that news about the Z2 range that's about to appear, so I'm likely to trade up to one of the Z2 models once they arrive, or take a Z or Z Force for the better camera if that's more cost-effective.", "time": "05-11-2017 03:33 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "How to reset sound controlling app on moto z droid?", "thread": [{"postID": "post5791045", "text": "In message+ I used to be able to chose what app I wanted to use to set a new ringtone, but now it only brings up the generic list on the phone doesn't give me the option to chose an app. How do I reset it so that I have to chose each time?", "time": "04-28-2017 09:29 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Moto Z Droid Space Bar gone EXCEPT on numeric keypad.

I was thinking of selling my 6p and grabbing the Moto Z to take its place. I spent a lot of time on the Force forum but I had not on the regular Z forum. Do you guys mind giving me some advice about the Z. I know the camera isn't as good as the Force but at the same time it's still a great camera. How have the updates been? I believe both models have the same 820 processor and screen resolution. Is $499 truly a good deal? Any help would greatly be appreciated.

The Moto Z is really thin and has a design language that\u2019s drastically different from the Moto X.Personally, I think the back looks pretty nice and rather \u201ctechy\u201d looking, with a glass + metal back along with the pins for the MotoMod system and a rather large camera hump that resembles the face of a Moto 360.But the front on my White/Gold model looks pretty goofy. My thoughts haven\u2019t really changed since the launch of the device at Lenovo TechWorld \u201916. The front of the device definitely looks kinda goofy, especially on the chin with the square fingerprint sensor and the rather-large circles for the IR sensors used to activate Moto Display. The Black/Lunar Gray model looks much more understated and sleek IMHO, but a DBrand Hyperblack Titanium skin is going on the front.It\u2019s also thin. REALLY THIN. At 5.2mm, it\u2019s the thinnest flagship smartphone around. But none of that matters to me. Without the case and included style shell, the phone just feels too darn thin, as if it\u2019s a really fragile piece of equipment. The included bumper and style shell helps \u201cbeef\u201d up the device a bit, making it easier for me to handle, but the Incipio OffGRID will be an almost-permanent addition to mind not just for the significant increase in thickness but also for its extended battery.But it does really feel solid. The phone feels quite well-put together and does feel like it\u2019s stronger than what its thin profile would suggest. Buttons are also very clicky, offering excellent tactile feedback, but they\u2019re very small and evenly spaced. Despite having an aggressive texture on the power button, I found myself mispressing either the lock or volume-down button at times. I preferred the layout on my old Note 7, but this isn\u2019t a particularly major concern to me.DISPLAYThe Moto Z utilizes a 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED panel that\u2019s presumably sourced from Samsung (like a lot of other mobile OLED panels).As it is OLED, all of the usual OLED traits are there. Very vivid colors, infinite contrast thanks to deep black levels and great power efficiency.I also found the display pretty good outdoors. It\u2019s not as bright as my old N7, but it does get very bright indeed, making it pretty easy to read in direct sun without having to squint too much.Another bonus is that there\u2019s a color option right in display settings where you can adjust the color gamut. By default, it\u2019s set to \u201cVivid\u201d, which sacrifices accuracy for more saturation. However, you can go for a \u201cStandard\u201d mode with reduces saturation in order to be more accurate as-per sRGB. It\u2019s not the most accurate display I\u2019ve seen, but it is quite accurate and I\u2019m happy Motorola added an option for it right in the display settings.PERFORMANCEThe Moto Z is a bit of an interesting thing on this front. All Moto Zs (minus the Z Play) use a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC, which utilizes a quad-core Qualcomm Kyro CPU and an Adreno 530 GPU built on a 14nm process by Samsung. Interestingly, the Droid Edition has its big cores clocked at 2.15GHz while the unlocked versions have it pegged back at 1.82GHz. The small cores stay at 1.6GHz, however.Despite the drop in clockspeed, the Moto Z performs very well. Stutters and actual lag were very rare in occurrence during my time of using it and while the UI may not be as smooth and snappy as that on a Google Pixel, it is definitely one of the faster phones I have used.The Z also utilizes UFS storage, which also results in some of the fastest app-launch speeds I have seen. Apps rarely take more than a second to load up from storage. And RAM management is also very good, with reloaded apps being a rarity.I haven\u2019t had much to complain about in terms of performance, despite the drop in clockspeed on the processor. However, note that the GPU is also underclocked. While this doesn\u2019t result in a noticeable degradation in performance to my eyes, if you\u2019re after every single frame-per-second, unless you\u2019re willing to unlock the bootloader and flash a different kernel, this might not be it for you.But overall, this is a pretty snappy phone. There\u2019s very little performance issues and the drop in clockspeed has almost no effect from my experience.\nCAMERAMotorola has never been known for having great cameras, or rather, a good camera. That started to go around with the Moto XPE, but even that had its share of flaws. The Moto Z aims to address some of those\u2026\u2026but it\u2019s rather odd.The main sensor is a Sony Exmor IMX214, a 1/3\u201d sensor with a resolution of 4160x3120. If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s the same sensor fitted on many devices dating back to 2014, such as the Nexus 6, HTC One A9 and Moto G 2015. The Z Force, on the other hand, uses a Sony Exmor IMX338, a 1/2.4\u201d sensor with a 21MP resolution, and it\u2019s an upgraded version of the IMX230 found in the Moto XPE. Both phones have OIS and f/1.8 apertures plus laser autofocus (though the Force also has phase-detection autofocus).The camera app is a welcome improvement over past Motorolas. While past Moto camera apps were simple, they were also unfamiliar and sometimes unintuitive as tapping anywhere on the screen takes a photo and one needs to slide to change focus. The Moto Z\u2019s camera is more conventional, utilizing a shutter button to take photos, a button to change modes, sliding gestures to open the gallery or settings menu but the slide-to-focus mechanic remains, although one can now tap to change the focus.I have not used the Z Force, so I am unable to comment on that, but from my time with the camera on the Moto Z, it is a capable camera, but falls a little short from similarly-priced rivals.Daylight performance is typically pretty good, with pleasant amounts of saturation, a large amount of detail and decent dynamic range. White-balance does land a touch warm at times, and it was common for me to dial back the exposure by at least 0.4EV as it does get a little too bright by default, however.When the light goes down, it reveals one key weakness of the Z; low-light performance. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s a bad performer. The wider aperture and OIS does help with aiding for low-light shots that are steady, but the smaller 1/3\u201d sensor does prove to be a bit of a sore point when it comes to noise. Low-light shots also come out pretty bright by default, sometimes resulting in more ISO noise than needed.Handily, the phone does come with a night mode that\u2019s automatically enabled when the surroundings are dark enough or when you adjust the exposure to a certain point. The OIS does help with steadying the shot for a clear night-capture and it does turn out pretty decent, although it still falls short of low-light champs like the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P.The camcorder performance is also pretty decent, but also has some flaws. The phone shoots at a 50Mbps bitrate when shooting 4K UHD video, which results in a pretty good looking video, with the option to shoot it in HDR and also enable software stabilization while in UHD. However, at least on mine, the phone has a tendency to drastically shift and hunt for focus, especially while panning. It makes it a little unpleasant to look at, something that I hope is sorted in a future software update.I have not used the selfie camera as I am not the type of guy who takes selfies, but I\u2019ll report back if I do use it a bit.Overall, the camera on the Moto Z is pretty good, which is a revelation compared to past Motos, which had truly horrendous and awful cameras. However, there are still some flaws which puts it just shy of top-tier performers. The Z Force does better in nearly all aspects, though.Samples found here: https://photos.google.com/share/AF1Q...ZFZGtzUWIyejN3SOFTWAREThe Z runs on a very-close-to-stock build of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. And it really is close-to-stock. There is almost no form of UI customization and add-ons, being largely like Google\u2019s vision of Android.Since there\u2019s very little change, I won\u2019t go too much into software, although Moto\u2019s additions are still there, alive and well.The main addition is the Moto suite, which provides different gestures and voice commands. I personally have always been fond of the flashlight and camera gestures, and I find that they both work really well, firing up almost consistently in a perfect manner. The voice command now works more like a customized \u201cOkay Google\u201d prompt, but it does work.Other than that, the Moto Z\u2019s software build is pretty much like stock Android. If you\u2019re coming from a Nexus, it should feel very familiar. Though I\u2019ll say that the stock screen density is just too large, especially considering the resolution and size of the display. Android 7.0 Nougat is currently rolling out. Mine hasn\u2019t got it yet, but I\u2019ll post updates below in the thread when it does. Also note that it does not receive security patches in a monthly manner, but does so as part of a package released every few months.BATTERY LIFEOne major con of having such a thin phone is having a smaller battery. The Z has a 2600mAh battery, which is actually pretty darn small for a 5.5-inch device. As such, I expected it to have Galaxy S6-levels of battery life, which is to say \u201cPretty darn bad\u201d. Turns out, I was sorta wrong\u2026.but also sorta right.On my regular usage pattern, I can get 3.5-4 hours of SOT over a 16-18 hour day. On more frugal days, where the phone is in standby most of the time, around 30 hours of total uptime is possible, though SOT goes back at around 2.5-3 hours.Now, that is actually better than I was expecting, but I can\u2019t help but think it could\u2019ve been better had they not made the phone so thin.The included TurboPower charger does charge quickly, though. In 30 minutes, I can top-up half of the phone\u2019s battery, although even plugging it into my non-QC battery bank resulted in decent charging speeds as well.As mentioned before, I am getting an Incipio MotoMod to make it last longer off a wallwart, so I\u2019ll report back when I get it and use it.MOTOMODSIt\u2019s great. No, really. It is.I currently only have the JBL speaker, but it is a pretty good speaker, as it\u2019s very loud and punchy. I had to turn it down a few notches due to how loud it is.Actual operation is also very simple. Just snap and it\u2019s done. Removal is almost as easy as putting it on, though the magnets on this are really strong.Motorola has committed to keeping the MotoMods system going with more support, but considering their past history, I hope they stay true to this one.OTHER STUFF WORTH MENTIONINGFingerprint sensor is lightning fast and usually very accurate, but it is prone to misreads, misfires and sometimes fails to detect my finger at all on the first go. Such moments are rare, however, and the sensor works well in most cases.The single mono-speaker has decent sound quality and is firing in the right direction, but high volumes do sometimes cause it to sound a bit tinny.Despite being in a Style Shell for almost all of its life, the camera glass has one or two faint scratches.It\u2019s nice that it comes with a bumper case, as it can be a bit hard to find suitable cases that don\u2019t hinder the MotoMods.I still miss the dimple, though.Radio performance is good, being able to hold onto a signal well based on carrier coverage and Wi-Fi performance is also quite good. Call quality was also very clear with few issues.FINAL THOUGHTSI personally think the Moto Z is a solid device, and actually does modularity very well. However, there are some flaws in this phone which I think can be deal-breakers for some, especially considering the price of the device, especially in its unlocked form. That said, I don\u2019t think people who opt for a Moto Z are going to be seriously let-down by their purchase, though I do recommend that you go for a Z Force if possible, as you\u2019ll get a bigger battery, more durable display and a better camera.\nIs it my absolute favorite of the year?

You can not like them, but you can't deny them. The camera is not in the same league as the S7, 10, or G5.

While I did warm up slightly over time, I still wasn't too much of a fan of it. And now, here we are. What a plot twist, eh?\nThe story on how I got it was pretty interesting. \nSome of you remember my bad luck with phones, beginning with dead LG G4s, and progressing to the Note 7, of which you already know the fate that befell that beautiful, but ill-fated device. \nSo, living on a 3.5 year old One M7 again for some time, since I had a vacation in Thailand popping up, I decided to go purchase a new phone there as an unlocked device. I initially wanted to go for an unlocked HTC 10 in Carbon Gray. Well, after some time searching for one, I concluded that finding an HTC 10 is like finding a needle in a haystack, as the place was pretty much populated with Huaweis, Oppos and Vivos, along with the usual Apple and Samsung section. My next choice was the ZTE Axon 7. I was very close to getting the gray model, only to be told that they were out of stock not only in the particular store I was in, but also throughout the city. It also didn't help that this particular Axon was the A2017G variant, which has poorer software support and global LTE compatibility. \nYet another defeat. The Oppo and Vivo devices didn't interest me and while the S7 edge is a mighty fine device, I wanted to try something different. There was actually a Moto Z and a Z Play right behind me, but I only played with them for a few minutes, and that particular store didn't have them in stock yet. An XPERIA XZ and X Compact was also present, but I had concerns with the way Sony's been going with their handset business.\nI decided that if I am unable to find a good Android-powered handset by the end, I may just spring for an iPhone 7 Plus, which had the 128GB variant in stock and was also globally unlocked (sadly, it has the Intel modem, which I didn't like, something which may influence my decision to just purchase the US unlocked model).\nAfter a while in Bangkok's famous Mahboonkrong mall, I came across a store whose other branch I visited the other day. Again, they didn't have the Axon 7 in stock (only the Axon 7 Mini), but when I asked about the Moto Z, they apparently did have quite a few in stock, mainly the Z Play but they also had 2 Moto Zs, albeit they were in white.\nAfter looking at the 2, I eventually decided on the regular Moto Z (even though I feel the Moto Z Play is the better all-rounder) and I got a JBL SoundBoost MotoMod for a pretty nice price. I'm still trying to find an Incipio mod to make the battery last longer.\nPretty interesting story on how I came to the Moto Z, eh? It was not what I planned for, but I am actually quite surprised by it. I'll post a full impressions and review after a while.", "time": "11-07-2016 06:09 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5550803", "text": "I think the Z is a great device.

The stock battery is pretty good, but the ability to slap on one of the mods gives it great battery life. The only concern I have is over updates and support.

The Tumi has that gun metal type stainless look. Not sure which one I'm going to wrap yet. I use either one of my battery mods a good bit. Although a little heavy, it's not too bad. Really overall the Force is still relatively thin or in line with other larger screen phones. What I like most is that either battery when attached looks like the phone came that way. I see so much potential for these mods. I'm hoping a company will revamp the current battery mod and make a slimmer version even if it doesn't have quite the same output as the current batteries have. The Force already has one of the longest battery life you can get so a slimmer version of the battery would still give you all the extra juice you will ever need in a days time, maybe even two days.

It's just so much snappier which lends me to feel that it's tuned more efficiently for the hardware than Samsung and TW.

The S Pen on the N7 is much better and I will miss the new features. But I'm happy with my Note 5. \nI have been watching reviews of the Moto Z and everyone said the phone is fast and lag free. The phone is light weight which is exactly what I want. I've owned a number of Motorola Androids that goes back to the Froyo days. The last Motorola I had was the Moto X. I had a lot of issues with Motorola so I stopped buying their phones. So I truly hope the Moto Z works out for me. \nI will admit I still love Samsung. Touchwiz has come along way.

From everything I've read on the subject the sweet spot for an Li-ion battery is between 40 and 80%. So there's that. Plus by strictly using the mod to power the device (or more correctly constantly keeping the main battery fully charged) you'll probably discharge the mod (an Li-ion battery) completely on a regular basis. [Taken from the web] \"One of the worst things you can do to a Li-ion battery is to run it out completely all the time. Full discharges put a lot of strain on the battery, and it's much better practice to do shallow discharges to no lower than 20 percent\". \nSo by using the main battery for 20% at the start, and then letting the mod do the rest you'll probably not deplete it too often which is better for the mod. The good news is that the mod is replaceable, but no sense helping it along to a quicker death .

The force with this mod would be about 13mm thick (too thick) and will have a 5,720 mAh battery capacity.\nFYI, a lot of devices that seemingly have dual front facing speakers, due to the dual grille setup, use the dual grill setup to trick you into believing that the phone has said setup, when its sound actually only comes out of the bottom grille. Moto has done this before, along with ZTE's 2015 axon lineup, and even the nexus 5x only fires sound through the bottom grille. The nexus 6p has a true dual speaker setup, like the MXPE. So, by the subtraction of one grille, many people think this is an inferior speaker setup to other front firing speaker phones, when a vast majority of phones with a dual grille front speaker setup only have single front firing speakers like this, because the sound only comes out of the bottom grille.", "time": "06-12-2016 03:03 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5221334", "text": "Thanks for the 411.

But if I'm to spend $800 and above, the phone had better be something that pushes its limits on what's possible, it had better be a phone that brings something unusual to the table than mere spec bumps.\nIt had better bring something drastically different, something exciting to the game, afterall if I have $900 and above to spend, then it has to be different from the phone next door. Phones are ridiculously expensive for what they offer nowadays, gone are the days where there was a clear disparity between an $850 phone and a $300 one. So if my concern is just performance, then I should probably get the OP3/moto g4/nexus 5X and just call it a day then.\nNow this is where the Moto Z comes in. Yeah, its not cheap when you factor in the price of the modules and all, but technology isn't cheap, neither is innovation. I'd rather buy a mysterious phone, a phone that kisses my imagination like the Z, than buy a flat out basic run of the mill top end smartphone like the htc 10/GS7 etc if you ask me (not the EDGE though).\nGranted this phone isn't for every body and if you don't like it, fine, but that doesn't take anything away from the Z. Yes, I know, There are few controversies like the removal of the headphone jack, the battery capacity and the release time frame, but something must always give in, usually, something always has to be sacrificed in other for something else to happen. The phone needed to be this thin for it to still look this good while using the Mods (I bet the Z will look better than the Z force when you use the Mods). The camera bump? I even find that interesting too. The headphone jack? Isn't that going to be the industry standard moving forward now? Moreso they're even reasonable enough to include and adapter in the box. The release date? Yeah that's probably the most stupid thing they could do (I wonder who came up with that idea).

The phone as it is has top notch specs across the board, like 4G Ram, 5.5\" QHD screen, SD 820, stock android ui, with the best feature set (like the best always on display on the market, the best voice assistant on the market, moto assist, one handed mode, smart screen mode, fm radio).\nWhat's not to like? This is even before we start scratching the surface of the possibilities of what the Mods can do along with their crazy implementation.\nThe design is daring and fantastic as opposed to these tired/uninspiring/repititive designs we now see everywhere (htc 10, Op3, g5, s7, p9) the same reason I loved the 6p and the S7E too.\nLike I said, the phones with their modules might not be cheap, yes, but technology isn't cheap, and usually, innovation isn't cheap either. Phones like the OP3 might be cheap and have great specs across the board but this phone isn't targeting that audience tbh..\nIts easy to see why Mods are the future, but, I'd rather have prefared if it were adopted by the iphone or samsung first, as that way there'll be far wider adoptation as against when its being done by MOTO or LG.\n*Take a bow* MOTO Z!!!!!!", "time": "06-16-2016 04:32 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5227337", "text": "Glad you like it!

I don't see any phone competing with that (even if they don't sell)\n@veteater. Actually, the Moto Z is made of steel at the back and aluminium at the sides, giving out the effect of glass. Pretty impressive stuff there.\nAs for me, I'd be going with the standard Moto Z. The Z and its thinness just looks downright premium (The All black one) even making the z force look at little dated when you put them side by side. \nNow, for instance, If the Z costs $500, I'd easily get the black battery case ($80) taking the battery capacity to almost 5,000mah, then buy the speaker Mod (that also has 1,000 mah) ($79) and camera Mod for maybe $200 (which will also have its own in built battery) amounting to about $950 then after that, I could buy the projector and the onecompute Mod and what ever comes out down the line..\nThis will make me use the Z for 2+ years as nothing released next year will have any in-built component that'll be close to being as good as what the Mods will be able to offer. No phone speaker will be better than those JBL speakers, or in built cameras better than those Hasselblad ones, nor will they have projectors inside them nor will they have batteries capacities close to 5,000mah yet, (not to even talk about having all of them possible on just one device) and that's even before we start seeing all the other Mods that might be released down the line adding that the price of the modules will only become cheaper.\nSo, in the end, I'd rather buy a device to rule them all by spending $1,500 on the Z and modules for 2+ years, than buy a $800 phone this year and another $800 flagship phone next year that will still end up being another run of the mill basic flagship phone you see everywhere.

Moto shattershield on the X and Z force models at least allows one to replace the top layer when scratched, and will not shatter at all due to being plastic. The s7 active, on the other hand, is only shatter-resistant because it has a decently thick plastic coating over the existing Gorilla Glass 4 display. Not only does it scratch easier than gorilla glass, but due to how the coating is made, it literally melts and bubbles away from the glass when burned (no one would realistically do that) or relegated to hot conditions, like being left in your Camry on a hot SoCal day for example... and the screen will still crack. So other than the larger battery, the active is not worth it. All the bloatware, the $100 price hike up to an insane $800, the fact that the s7 active basically is only splash-proof, or the fact that I could get an s7 (which I would never do) and a life proof and come in cheaper than the active. Oh, also the s6 active literally got marshmallow 3 days ago. Really, phones are only water resistant, if you want waterproof you need a case that is waterproof. I've spilled iced tea on my turbo 2 which I damned near baby so it is in almost pristine condition right now, and it survived, but I wouldn't purposely submerge my device in water.\nAnother thing: if you had a super-durable phone in every regard, it would basically be made out of a solid chunk of rubber, first off, or a metal unibody sandwiched between two thick coatings of rubber. The screws to access the internals of the phone would be exposed, and would have to go all the way around the device like a samsung. Every port that could get water in it would be covered by a flap, like pre-2015 Sonys, the earpiece, speaker(s) and noise cancelling mics would have a waterproofing nanocoating, even though this nanocoating technology is great on its own. The screen would be shatterproof and built like that of the Moto. The speaker(s) and mics would have to be on the front as to not make cuts/points of entry in the rubber, like the Moto Z. The fingerprint scanner would either be on the front in a setup like the Moto Z's or integrated into the power button, and the phone would have to be at least 8mm thick.

The texture on the steel attracts fingerprints.\n-The phone is quite flexible (I tried to bend it a little when no one was looking, as well as flex it, and flex the phone does. It flexes about as much as my Turbo 2, which, for reference, flexes a lot. However, due to the steel back and how well the Z is put together, nothing popped out of the phone unibody and it seemed to \"lock out\". However, the phone does feel dainty, and as if you are going to break the damned thing, just because of its weight and thickness. So, until JerryRigEverything snaps the thing in half (or doesn't) refrain from putting the phone in skinny jean pockets.\n-It is literally the fastest, zippiest phone I have ever used. No kidding.\n-The camera is very good, but not LG G5 or GS7 good.\n-The fingerprint scanner is NOT crooked, contrary to what Droid Life says. And it is definitely a small scanner. (Disclaimer) every fingerprint scanner on every phone is a little crooked, some more noticeably so.\n-The side bezels are slim and so is the top bezel, and the bottom bezel is basically the same size as my turbo 2. \nOverall, the phone seems like a very nice phone that needs to be compared against this year's nexus.", "time": "07-26-2016 06:39 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5284203", "text": "Interesting.

The mods are the most innovative thing done to a smartphone for a long while... It's about damn time. However, the standard Z is too expensive. The camera on the standard Z is better than that of the Nexus 6P's but doesn't compare to that of the GS7, HTC 10, or LG G5. And battery life is a bit short with the 2600 mAh battery, however, the phone is quite efficient. The unlocked variant of the phone will with be less expensive than the Droid edition on Verizon, at probably about $450-$550, at which price this phone and its mods would be a steal. But $624 is steep for the Z.\nSure, there are your ZTE Axon 7s and Oneplus 3s of the world, at $400-$450, but they only work on GSM carriers, just like the coming unlocked Z. So right now, you are basically out of luck if you are on Verizon and don't want the bloatware or outrageously priced devices on their network. Really, the only option at this point if you want a high end phone that is less than GS7 price and works on all four carriers is the upcoming nexus. If an unlocked Z would work on all four carriers it would be just as good, or better of a deal than the nexus. \nHowever, the ONLY smartphone you can buy if you want assured monthly security patches is the nexus. Samsung has been doing well in this regard because they have the money to afford the monthly updates. Motorola and the rest of them are skating on ice in the phone market, and none of them provide monthly security patches. Their update schedules are terrible because they cannot afford it. At least motorola spoke on the matter. So, as much as I like the Moto Z and as much as I want one, I am going to most likely get this year's nexus because I avoid Verizon bloatware and don't end up paying $600+ for a high end phone, and I get stock android. Also, I receive instantaneous updates in every regard. So I want a moto Z, and it is one of the best, if not the best, phones of the year so far, but am basically forced to get the nexus if I want Verizon service but don't want Verizon bloatware, or the slow security updates that come along with any phone that is not a nexus or a high end galaxy.", "time": "07-29-2016 01:36 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5288578", "text": "The Moto Z price isn't very relevant for many buyers who can get a deal at some point.

I have created a rating scale, consisting of 100 points. 25 for loudness, 20 for clear audio, 25 for bass, and 25 for mids-treble, and an extra 5 thrown in for putting the speaker in the right location. \n*Content utilized for the test:\nSvidden- We Are (EDM/Dubstep)\nDisturbed- Open Your Eyes (Rock)\nLeafyIsHere (Voice/Talking)\nSamsung Galaxy Note 7:\nLoudness 17/25\nClarity 18/20\nBass 15/25\nMid-Treble 22/25 \nLocation 2/5\nOverall: 73/100...C\nI just wish it were on the front, as it is a good speaker unit. It is well balanced, and while not as loud as the HTC 10 or the Droid Turbo 2, it is clear. Bass was decent, and Mids are where the speaker begins to come alive. Treble was not overly sharp or overly muddy... However, the phone was not at exactly full volume when tested, so I cannot comment on distortion at full blast (it was at 90% volume). Unfortunately, you cannot hear the speaker if you are holding it in landscape because it's n the bottom of the phone. So while a good speaker, it is in the wrong location.\nMoto Z Droid:\nLoudness 16/25\nClarity 20/20\nBass 13/25\nMid-Treble 25/25\nLocation 5/5\nOverall: 79/100...C+\nThe Moto Z speaker is a good one. And, it is on the front, great for watching movies and playing video games with. However, the speaker is pretty mediocre as far as loudness goes. It is very clear in its sound, and distortion was unnoticed at full blast. Mids and highs were sharp and simply nice to hear on the Z and clearer than those of the Turbo 2, but the speaker lacks bass when compared to the Note 7, HTC 10, and its Droid Turbo 2 predecessor, although the EDM/Dubstep song played did sound decent on the Z, if a bit lackluster on bass. Other audio samples, especially voices, sounded very good on the Z, where bass really isn't required. As long as you don't listen to a ton of Dubstep music or anything that has more than moderate bass levels, the speaker on the Z is a good unit.\nDroid Turbo 2:\nLoudness 20/25\nClarity 17/20\nBass 19/25\nMid-Treble 22/25\nLocation 6/5 (EXTRA POINT!) \nOverall: 84/100...B \nThe Droid Turbo 2's audio experience is simply enjoyable. No, the dual grilles at the bottom does not mean dual speakers. The right grille is the speaker, and the left is the loudspeaker. The one at the top is the earpiece, in a totally different setup than the Moto Z's \"one speaker for all functions\" approach. Since the speaker on the Turbo 2 is larger and most likely has more powerful drivers than that of the Moto Z's, the sound is louder and definitely more bass heavy, which can be seen almost instantaneously when the phone is listened to side by side with the Z. Anyway, the amount of bass is very enjoyable and comes in handy when listening to EDM/Dubstep music, or anything bass-heavy. Mids and highs weren't sharp and clear like the Z's; while they were definitely there in full precedence due to the notably balanced sound coming from the Turbo 2, they were a little muddy. I allotted the Turbo 2 the extra location point because although they are both on the front, the speaker at the top of the front is somewhat awkward. If the Turbo 2's speaker had slightly clearer sound (especially in mids and treble) then it would be one of the best (if not the best) single speaker units on the market to date. Definitely a great speaker unit.\nHTC 10:\nLoudness 23/25\nClarity 20/20\nBass 20/25\nMid-Treble 24/25\nLocation 6/5 (EXTRA POINT!)\nOverall: 93/100...A\nThe HTC 10 simply takes the cake here. It is extremely loud and clear, and basically every point in every audio sample I played was repeated amazingly. There is the tweeter up top, and the woofer on the bottom, for Bass and Mids. Sure, the latter will be covered during gameplay, but the tweeter is decent by itself, though just as advertised, the tweeter is for treble. But the sound experience as a whole was simply amazing, and in my opinion, better than the HTC One M9 before it. If you want a great phone and an audiophile's dream that works on Verizon (I don't think the ZTE Axon 7 does) then the HTC 10 is the phone to beat.

But I had trouble getting a decent shot of my kids playing sports (indoor, hockey (so it was fast)) with the stock camera. Tried other apps to get a 'sport' mode, but couldn't get a clear pic without blur. So since I like gadgets, and now had a real reason to try it, I bought it.\nRandom thoughts: Couple things I didn't know from the reviews I saw were that it had a couple different scenes, including a sport mode. That worked great for taking action shots. There is a delay taking the pic due to the focus, but when you start anticipating that, it works good. The flash fully lights a completely dark room. At full zoom, the physical camera button is hard to press without a shake, but you can use the screen's shutter button, and it works great. The'chin' at the bottom of the phone that people complain about makes this easy and comfortable to hold. It feels well made, and is fun to use. The optical zoom makes a huge difference in getting close to the action when you cannot move closer yourself, like a sports event. \nI was on the fence, but after having it 1 day, I think I totally made the right decision.

But having the mod means you have many, many more options of what you can do with the photo after you take it, without having to carry additional devices (laptop, etc) or transfer files. You can take the picture, then edit, share, etc right away on the same device. But will you actually still use it after ~4 years? That regular point & shoot camera will still have the same usability ten years down the road...\nFor me, it'll come down to how good the photos are (the Z's camera is already pretty darned good, and I have a DSLR if I want REALLY good photos), and what the price is.

And probably better than most 3,000 mah phones tbh", "time": "07-30-2016 04:02 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5291233", "text": "It is slightly more efficient for the size of battery it has than the Z force, but the standard Z does not have the battery life of your average 3000 mAh phone. A bit ambitious of a statement... . Since I am here now, I will go ahead and give a second impressions review of the phone, as I went to the Verizon store to actually get to really use the phone (standard Z):\n-Design\nI have nothing but good things to say about the design, It is a beautiful phone, and is ludicrously thin. The back is stainless steel and it doesn't feel at all like glass, contrary to what dome reviewers said. The phone is not the most comfortable to hold without a mod, due to the lack of ergonomics in hand, flat back, and sharp edges, but a simple style shell fixes that with its slight curves round the edges, and the battery mod makes the phone feel amazing in the hand. The top of the phone's front houses the 5MP front camera, the front facing speaker/earpiece, an IR camera, and a front facing flash, the usual affair for a flagship motorola at this point. The bottom contains a moto logo, a fingerprint scanner, as well as two IR cameras flanking the fingerprint scanner. Below that are two noise cancelling mics. Side note: the white front exposes everything, and literally makes the front of the phone so ugly that you wonder why the white version of the phone even exists. The black front hides all of the sensors and therefore looks nice.\nAround top, there is a microSD card tray, that doubles as a SIM card tray. On the left, there is nothing, and on the right, there are your volume buttons, and below those, the power button with a slight texture. On the bottom, there is a USB-C port. Around back is the 13MP Sony IMX214/IMX278 camera, laser autofocus, and the dual LED flash. Another noise cancelling mic is at the bottom of the back of the phone. Said phone measures 6.04\" by 2.96' by 5.19mm thick.\n-Display (source: Anandtech)\nThe phone has a 5.5\" AMOLED display at a resolution of 2560x1440 pixels (1440p) at a pixel density of 534 ppi. It is bright and shows relatively accurate colors, when compared to my Droid Turbo 2. I think the GS7 display looked better, however. Display measurements:\nWhite point: 7,080K (Kelvins)\nThis means that the phone's display's whites are a little bit cool, and definitely cooler than those of the Nexus 6P or Oneplus 3 (sRGB mode).\nGrayscale DeltaE2000: 3.33\nGrayscale accuracy is worse than that of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Note 5, as well as both the Nexus 6P and the Oneplus 3 in their respective sRGB modes, due to a cooler white point that also throws grays off a little bit, especially lighter shades of gray.\nSaturation Accuracy DeltaE2000: 3.09\nThis is quite a good result, but not as good as the Galaxy S7, Note 5, Oneplus 3, or Nexus 6P. Color saturation is very close to the target sRGB color space, although blue is a bit oversaturated, and red is ever so slightly undersaturated. This causes a slight shift in secondary colors magenta and yellow.\nGMB Accuracy DeltaE2000: 2.53\nOverall color accuracy is very good and on par with every other flagship. So, the display is a well calibrated AMOLED, although its whites and grays are slightly cool.\n-Software\nWell, its close-to-stock with some Motorola enhancements, and the Verizon bloatware we ALL love, right?\nAnyway, instead of the Moto Z coming with the Google Now Launcher preloaded, it comes with \"Launcher3\", somehting that Verizon has had Motorola put on the Droid line of phones since the original droid turbo. It is obviously different from Google's own launcher: it lacks a Google Now leftmost screen, and the backgrounds for the app drawer as well as those for the folders and widget menus are all transparent. Regardless, everything is kept close to stock android. You have your usual suite of Google apps, and a slew of verizon apps. The games can be deleted, luckily, and every Verizon app other than \"Voice Mail\" can be disabled. Then there's the usual affair of Motorola apps, with the exclusion of the Gallery app, which has been replaced with Google Photos, and the old calendar app, which has been replaced with Google's calendar. The phone is literally the fastest phone I have ever used. There was no lag or slowdowns WHATSOEVER during operation, it put my Turbo 2 to shame and made the S7 look like it was moving in slow-motion, no kidding. I will post benchmarks and camera information later, when I can get a better look at those aspects of the phone.\n-Audio\nThe phone has a single front-facing speaker. While I didn't spend very much time listening to it, I can definitely say that it is a good speaker. The sound is loud and clear, and actually quite crisp. Unfortunately, the speaker lacks good bass/low end. However, in the midrange, it starts to come alive. Where the speaker really shines is its treble, with clear high tones that are not overly pitchy and have a decent richness to them, with little distortion. For a better summary of the audio experience: Imagine an HTC 10 without the subwoofer, just the tweeter, and add a slight bit more richness and bass to the speaker. However, while the speaker on the Z is good, it is by no means the best, and its inherent lack of bass allows it to be outmatched by the likes of, say, the Droid Turbo 2. And I obviously don't have access to the USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, so I don't know what headphone audio sounds like through the Z and its adapter.\n-Battery\nfor some reason, the charger on the demo unit was not working, so I was able to pseudo-test the battery on the Z a little, and from what I can tell just from using the device for about 45 minutes (light-moderate use), the battery drained about 9 percent, from 35% to 26%. Then again, I am spoiled by the great uptimes I receive from my turbo 2, with its gargantuan 3,760 mAh battery. But still, the Z would probably give you about 3-4 hours of SOT with moderately heavy use, which is about right on par with what an LG G5 would get and less than what a GS7 or HTC 10 would get. However, for such a low capacity battery, it is an efficient phone. Again, it is about on par with the LG G5, but not the GS7 or HTC 10. The fix for that is the battery mod, which increases total capacity to 4,820 mAh. It can be utilized to simply recharge the phone, or could be used as something that is kept on the phone daily, that keeps your phone at 100% until the mod dies, then the phone uses its internal battery. If the mod used on the phone daily, it works somewhat like certain fast chargers, including Motorola's own turbocharger, where it charges the phone's internal battery to 100%, and the phone simply utilizes the charger as its power source instead of its own internal battery, unlike battery cases that simply charge the phone, and serve no other function but to charge the phone. Since it is almost 5,000 mAh of battery to be charged, this will cause you to charge your phone overnight instead of topping off.\nOverall, the Z seems like an innovative and spectacular phone, if a bit too pricey. The price of the unlocked Z will certainly be more reasonable and a bit less expensive than that of the droid edition. However, I would not settle in to buying one until the nexus comes out, as that is truly this phone's only real competition.

That's another $480 for the joy of being in contract, or do they waive the access charge increase if your buying on payments? Good question because Best Buy has it for a buck. In that case they would raise it. \nSo maybe clue me in if you know, does buying the Z on payments cause an increase in the access fee? and, does it put you in contract for another 2 years? Maybe different with different plans, I dunno just how the \"M\" plan fits in here. In any case back to my initial head scratcher, what's the incentive to be in contract? I'm not really seeing anything jump out at me. Some devices give you a gift card, some don't. Existing customers get bill credits of maybe $300?

So many phones for the average users out there to choose from, the Z might not be their device of choice. I'm not interested in the mods but the first thing I thought of was having to carry them around with me. And with the possibility of even more coming out later this just increases. By the time Verizon's exclusive is over the Z will be approaching old news status. Between Samsung and Apple the competition is fierce. An awful lot of folks will opt for a new iPhone 7 over the Z which should probably be out by the time Verizon releases it's exclusive hold on the Z.

You can even tell by the sudden dryness in the media about the note7. Its now basically old articles you see all over the web.\nThe only thing the note has going for it is its samsung fan base, otherwise, I don't see how its actually better than the Z and lol, you're not a Moto fanboy stop lying here.\nYou're more of a samsung die hard coming to big up the underwhelming note7 using the situation of the forum (at the same time forgetting the reason for it), God, its so obvious..

I waited months to buy my 2013 Moto X. I\u2019d found my color combination in ten minutes and fallen in love. It was the last AT&T-branded I would ever willingly buy, and I loved it to death. No, literally. I used it quite hard and it shorted out less than two months after purchase. And I got burn-in on the next two 2013\u2019s I went through, and when my last 2013 got upgraded to a 2014 by Motorola Support, I was honestly a little fearful about the size jump. But I loved the 2014 Moto X, even if I had to go from my lovely white face to black to avoid the pimply look of the IR sensors\u2026 And it was a faithful, if slightly underpowered and overworked device, and I loved the fluff out of Touchless Controls AKA Moto Voice.\nThe 2015 Moto X announcement left me groaning. Sure, they\u2019d finally added a microSD slot, and sure, they\u2019d finally given it enough power (though perhaps not enough batter), but the thing was a whale. Maybe not a whale like the Nexus 6 had seemed the year before, but my size 7 jeans and their tiny, tiny pockets looked at that phone and cried. And I couldn\u2019t in good conscience upgrade to it. \nThis year, the Moto Z announcement is months earlier, again. And it left me groaning a little, again. I don\u2019t think the device is terrible. Far from it, in fact; it looks like it\u2019d be an interesting phone to play with, especially from my customization-obsessed viewpoint. But at 5.5\u201d and any illusion of small bezels abandoned, it was still a big phone (though not the KAIJU the Phab 2 Pro was). Even worse, by the time I\u2019d be able to buy it unlocked, it\u2019d be old news and fighting with the full fall release schedule.\nIt\u2019s one thing for a phone to be a carrier exclusive for a month. It\u2019s another thing for a phone to be a world exclusive for an entire Duarte-damned season.\nWhile this phone is new and hot, it\u2019s only available to subscribers of the big red devil checkmark. And when it comes to GSM and the rest of the world in the fall, it will be old news, even if new and noteworthy Motomods are coming out. It will be up against the new Note, the leaks of the new Nexus phones, and the new iPhones. Unless those mods are insanely hot, I don\u2019t see the Moto Z competing with the Fall lineup. Releasing worldwide in the summer would at least give it a few months to get out there and get really used before it had to deal with newer shiner ****.\nI do not take issue with three of the more popular dings on the phone:It doesn\u2019t have a headphone jack. Fine. I use Bluetooth most of the time anyway. It\u2019s one less thing to break and it means I have an excuse to go test out USB-C headphones, including those noise-cancelling ones from HTC I\u2019m still waiting for. And if you\u2019re a true audiophile, you\u2019re not buying this phone anyway, you\u2019re buying a V10, HTC 10, or an audio-centric phone. Android\u2019s about choice, and if you\u2019re an audiophile or someone who just hates Bluetooth (you are WRONG, by the by), then you have other options to exercise. No one\u2019s holding a gun to your head to buy this phone.It\u2019s not too thin. It\u2019s not. All the people who went to the demo area and started using the phone without at least a Style Shell on it said the phone is too thin, and they\u2019re right, but this is not a phone that was made to be used naked. You don\u2019t need those pogo pins exposed and vulnerable, so if you\u2019re not getting either a case (oh sweet binary, the case market for this phone is gonna be a nightmare), you should at least be getting a Style Shell to cover the pins. Get a nice color or maybe the leather. Cleaning the leather won\u2019t be a ***** this time since you can take it off the phone! Or get a battery mod in a nice design and be functional _and_ fashionable. \nThe instant you put a shell or Motomod on this phone, it\u2019s no longer too thin. Once you get into the functional mods like the speakers or the pico projector, the phone\u2019s verging on too thick. If the phone had been made the same thickness as a Galaxy S7, once you stuck a shell on it, it\u2019d\u2019ve been too thick. It\u2019s not too thin; it\u2019s just not a complete phone out of the box, which is a whole other issue that needs to be discussed closer to launch.The camera bump is ugly and it makes the bump pointless. The camera bump has a point, and they're some pretty points, too. The first being that you needed more space for the camera sensor, the flashes and the laser focus. Second, if the camera wasn\u2019t bumped out, once you put a shell on it, the camera would be recessed, which would be pointless, and once you\u2019d put the speaker/projector mod on, it\u2019d be in a tunnel. Third, the camera\u2019s bump is distinctive and helps keep the magnetic mods aligned and in place instead of slipping all over the back of this steel smartphone. \nThat camera bump ain\u2019t pointless - it\u2019s required.\nThere\u2019s still a lot about the Moto Z to love, and it\u2019s the stuff that wasn\u2019t even mentioned in the presentation. It\u2019s the IR sensors that lit up the screen when Yang Yuanqing finally pulled the sheet off the Moto Z. It\u2019s the Moto Voice that I still use even more than I use Google Now because Google Now still won\u2019t let me customize my launch phrase. It\u2019s the mostly stripped down version of Android that Motorola achieved during its short tenure under Google. That\u2019s the Motorola I fell in love with, and it\u2019s still hiding under the mods and the camera bumps and that horrible square fingerprint scanner (WHAT WERE YOU THINKING). And even though that Motorola is still hiding in there, it can\u2019t break the spell and give me back the magical phones I proudly owned the last few years.\nThe honeymoon is over.

In 2013 my posts are all over the forums defending the decision to use the custom SoC they used, and I was using exclusively Moto phones until the 6P was released (So three X 13's, 14, 15, Nexus 6 and a G + a 360). I didn't to use my X 2015 very long because a month or two in my daughter apparently ninja-star'd it into the floor - which is when I had to return to using the Nexus 6 / X '14 combo I'd been dual wielding for a bit. Losing Moto is like losing a long-time friend (even though there's only two years and 8 devices in our relationship) - I didn't come to the breakup lightly and I wouldn't have chosen it. \nSo, I don't believe the Z is going to be a bad phone. I think it's going to be a very good phone for those who choose it. But there's no denying it's a directional shift and it's one that I find very frustrating because of the opportunity cost. Moto decided to stop supporting their devices with timely updates and security patches. That doesn't matter to most people, but it matters a lot to me. Moto decided to provide less support for their devices from a customer service standpoint. That doesn't matter to most people, but it matters to those who get phones that have issues. Or that have questions about shipping delays, etc. Moto was one of the leaders in bringing new and better things to Android. MotoMaker, the G line, the X line, very well designed phones that are not in line with the new Z. That's fine, the Z is something new. It's not a continuation of the X line - but the X line is what I was on board with. And I came to the X line because it was a Nexus + More Better Stuff that worked on Verizon. The 2014 was even more so, with leather and even better features. The 2015 brought it more in line with mainstream devices. In 2016, I can safely say, the Z is definitely not a Nexus + More Better Stuff. It's a Moto Z, which is different. Where the X was about simplicity - data driven components matching how customers actually use their phones - the Z seems to be more about blazing a new path and changing how customers use their phones. \nI completely understand some people are going to love it and some are going to hate it. And to each their own and we shouldn't ever begrudge someone for having or sharing their opinion on what they want to spend their money on. I don't believe that it is elitist to say that one line of phones fits a person's needs better than another. I also don't believe it is safe to say the Z is the logical next step in the X evolution.

I can't help but feel like the back of the Moto Z was designed to always have a module on it -- but selling the phone without a basic one in the box seems like the cheap, money-grabbing thing to do. Look! You can add functionality to your phone with modules! And without one, your phone will feel too thin, have a huge camera hump, and its contact points (that should be squeaky clean for a solid connection to be made to the phone for a module) are fully exposed right out of the box! Oh, and if you want to cover that up, buy a module (yay, more money for us). It feels like they're putting an unfinished product in the box and telling us that what we need to make it really whole is sold separately. meh. I hope there's something in the box to cover that up ... but I'm betting not.\nOh yeah, and then there's that whole Verizon exclusive thing. That alone is going to destroy this phone's chances of success in the broader market. Ah, well. Hopefully Lenovo will learn from this (or maybe not).\nI got disgruntled with moto/lenovo when they stopped caring about updates to their existing phones and their dev/forums/support team started acting like they were one giant, disorganized mess. At that point, I exited the Motorola Feedback Network for good, and I worried about what the future with them would be like. I see now that I was absolutely right to walk away after the 2014 Moto X, and after seeing the Moto Z, I know that I will not be coming back (at least not for a very long time).", "time": "06-12-2016 12:25 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5221352", "text": "Some are saying it will come with one shell included so you don't have to have those connectors naked nor have a camera hump.", "time": "06-12-2016 03:46 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5221399", "text": "I'm leaning towards believing that it will come with a basic Style Shell.\nPosted via the Android Central App on the Moto X Pure Edition", "time": "06-12-2016 04:26 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5223576", "text": "I've been seeing rumors about this?

There were a lot of things I liked but also some things I didn't like that were pretty significant to me.\nFirst, let's start off with the good. The overall hardware is pretty much your typical flagship Android smartphone. A Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of memory and 32GB of storage that's expandable via microSD. Pretty high-end across the board. I also liked how they returned to AMOLED this time around, which is great, especially for stuff like Moto Display, of which an OLED panel makes sense for anyway. Super-quick charging on the Z Force is a nice bonus along with the improved cameras (I'm still not sure if Moto has sorted out their processing, but the addition of OIS and the release of a heavily-improved camera app should help things out). Software is basically close-to-stock Android with some extras like the aforementioned Moto Display, which I liked since the OG Moto X from 2013. And finally, even though I'm still not big on the whole modular design on smartphones unless a universal standard that is adopted by more major smartphone OEMs becomes a thing, Motomods is much better implemented than LG's \"Friends\" IMO, since it doesn't require a battery pull (and subsequent power off), can be hot swapped as a result, is easier to snap on and remove and has more modules at launch, which are infinitely more useful than the ones LG has, with more to come. Also, a Type-C charging port is a nice touch (though I'm not sure if it is fully-compliant. Probably not, due to quick-charging, but if it's anything like LG's implementation, USB Power Delivery and the other nifty features of USB-C should still be there).\nHowever, there's a couple of downsides that just don't bode well with me, personally. First of all, the design is a bit....ehh. I mean, the phone overall doesn't look bad or anything, but some parts look somewhat...off to me. The flat-tire design on the camera module looks weird to me and the squared FPS on the front is also kinda odd-looking (not helping is that the visible IR sensors on the white model makes it look somewhat goofy to me). The lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack is also a disappointment for someone like me since I use it very frequently, and while Moto is smart to offer an adapter in the box to lessen the pain significantly, I can't help but feel that it's not going to go well with quite a number of folks. And of course, the battery on the standard Moto Z. I'm sorry, but 2,600mAh on a phone with flagship hardware and a QHD display is borderline unacceptable at this stage. Haven't we learned from the Galaxy S6? Given that the Moto Z Force has a much larger 3,500mAh battery in a similar (albeit slightly thicker) profile, I can't help but wonder why they didn't go with something closer to 3000mAh in the standard model. Also, this is more of a personal thing, but I think it's just too thin. I know, I know. They have to make it thin to make sure the Motomods don't add extra bulk or anything, but surely, even an extra 0.5mm couldn't hurt?\nOverall, I'm rather mixed on this device. It was actually better than what I thought it would be, but my expectations weren't really high to begin with. It delivers a lot on what I expected and it does a lot of things pretty well, especially when it comes to the basic Android experience. However, some things, like the pretty disappointing battery capacity on the standard model, and lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, just doesn't really do favors for the device for me. I'm also not too sure on how Moto will support this device in the future via security patches and software updates, since they have gotten pretty slow since the Lenovo takeover. Perhaps the one thing that I think really blows it for the device is availability. Throughout the summer, it's exclusive to Verizon, and an unlocked version will come in the fall. On it's own, that might not sound too bad, but when you consider that other phones, like the Samsung Galaxy Note 6/7, the iPhone 7 and the 2016 Nexus devices, usually come out in that timeframe (the Note may come sooner), then it doesn't look too rosy. However, I do hope that Moto does shift through a good amount of these phones, since we need competition in the Android space, and for all the flak the Moto Z has been getting, it at least does a lot of things right, especially the Motomods, surprisingly enough.\nOn a side note, anyone noticed the \"Moto\" logo above the front-facing fingerprint sensor?
