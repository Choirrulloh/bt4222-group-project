Chicago area in fact. \n \r\nI'm sure the one in Europe is just as good as the one here. \n \r\nI don't know if I'm a \"power user\", but I do use my phone somewhat frequently. The battery life is very good to great, though I would not say it's #1. But you can do things like disabling or uninstalling unneeded apps, and even temporarily disable Location to help with that. I did that the other day when I went to a concert and the battery life wasn't bad all things considered. I've had the phone since January, so not super long, but enough to say it's been pretty consistent so far.\n \r\nI can only answer your question about 2G/3G/4G based on my own experiences here in the states andreuwz. For me, the connectivity is EXCELLENT and the phone even comes with VoLTE (Voice Over LTE), which gives it even greater reception and access to the newest and best signals, like Band 12 (aka 700 MHz) spectrum, which for people who have T-Mobile (which I do), you can ONLY get if HTC took the time (and spent the money) to certify it with T-Mobile as they require certification if a phone is to be able to use VoLTE on their network. HTC DID do this on the unlocked HTC 10 (which is what I have), which was a major factor in me switching to them from Sony. Not only does VoLTE give you access to Band 12 here, it also connects calls faster and makes them even clearer as HD Voice is a part of the VoLTE package. You should check to see if VoLTE is available in your country as the unlocked 10 WILL have it included if you do. \n\n \n\n \n \r\nHope this helps!", "date": "11 Sep 2017"}, {"text": "it's brilliant.

I was a huge Sony Xperia fan, but after getting the Xperia X Performance last year, I found it was very much under par vs. other phones and my previous Z3, which was awesome. Last year I owned the S7 for 4 mos, and I will tell you I was really NOT pleased with that phone. You mentioned lagging? It lagged ALL the time. It's that crappy TouchWiz UI they put on their phones. It sucks. Plus other things that suck with Samsung and that phone were the overly complicated Settings menu, how the screen and camera took or displayed oversaturated pictures, the audio SUCKED on it. I mean it was AWFUL man. The speakers rendered bass sounds and made them sound like lasers being shot off. lol Via headphone the audio quality is under par, and there was an issue when I connected using the MicroUSB-C port that caused interruptions to my music once every 3-5 minutes. I found out later it was a BUG in the audio driver of the USB port, and I don't even know if Samsung ever fixed it or not. \n \r\nSo I went from S7, to Xperia X Perf, and then in January I gave the HTC 10 a second try. I was so focused on Sony that when I tried it a year ago, I kinda wasn't as impressed, like with camera, and returned it after a week. But since then, the 10's gotten at least THREE major camera updates, which has made a SIGNIFICANT improvement in the camera quality. Anyway, in January I gave it a second try in a different color (Topaz Gold), and this time my experience was WAY better!\n \r\nReasons to buy the 10: the 2K screen, the great premium feel of the aluminum unibody, the great & easy-to-use camera, the simple Settings menu & UI, the battery life (is really good, better than S7's IMO), the audio quality is not just better than the S7's, but as good if not better than the LG V20's Quad DAC!! Speakers (there's 2 vs. S7's 1) are better on 10. I compared the 10 to the V20 and found the quality to be equal but the 10 can get louder via headphones. There's also little things like Auto Call Answer with the 10 where you can just put the phone up to your ear when you get a call and it automatically takes it. NO need to swipe the screen first! I keep that feature on all the time. And the phone definitely doesn't lag at all vs. the S7. The call quality is also much better on the 10 than the S7. MUCH clearer. Signal quality is great on both, but what good is that if the call isn't clear?\n \r\nHere's more on why the 10's audio is incredible: www.androidcentral.com/htc-10-audio-testing-boom\u00adsound-evolved  (Definitely check out the headphone audio part, and all parts in BOLD)\n \r\nSo there ya go!

Samsung is a lil better now on that front, but they STILL have that LAGGY TouchWiz garbage UI and the Settings menu still make you think harder to find things than you should have to. \n \r\nRegarding battery life, Phone Arena compared the two and found that the HTC 10 has a battery life of 7 hrs and 10 min, where the S7 came up a little shorter at 6 hrs and 37 minutes. So once again, HTC outdoes (overrated) Samsung. lol Even the newer phones from each have the same results. The HTC U11's battery life is rated at 9 hours and 3 min, while the S8+ is rated 8 hrs even, with the S8 only being about 20 min better.

I think the issue is the PRESSURE of water. If you drop a few droplets on the speakers (or etc holes) and it gets in there, per IP 53, it should still be fine. But when you shoot water at it from like a garden hose, or if you drop it in say a pool (esp a deep pool), the pressure is gonna FORCE the water in more, and then the chances of it getting water damaged go up significantly. So again, my answer is no with 99% certainty. \n \r\nDepending on when you bought your 10 and from where, you may or may not have Uh-Oh Protection. If you do, you can get it replaced for free if it DOES get water damaged or the screen cracks (no questions asked). If you bought your 10 more than a month or so ago and it was purchased directly from HTC.com (U.S. only), then you HAVE Uh-Oh Protection as I do (I bought mine off HTC.com in January).

The U.S. HTC site has it, so you may wanna check there, but then you gotta pay for shipping probably. Or else eBay? Might be cheaper on eBay. \n \r\nThe Sprint Store by me has the U11 (Sprint is the ONLY U.S. carrier that has it in their stores). I just confirmed that, so gonna try to go check it out sometime soon. I won't be buying it though cuz I hate phablets, plus I prefer having the 3.5mm port, and also I prefer the look of the 10 over the U11's.

Who would've thought 2 years ago that I'd be saying that now about an HTC phone?! lol Also, I like that with Edge Sense you can take pictures using only ONE hand instead of two. I take it with one, but it's awkward cuz have to hold it a certain way and stretch my thumb to get to the shutter button icon. lol Edge Sense \"squeeze to take a photo\" is more convenient.

It was better before when it was Classic BoomSound (vs. the new Hi-Fi BoomSound). But I'm sorry, I can't agree on the camera at all. I TOO had the One M8 and LOVED it, but the camera was at best very good, maybe SOMETIMES great, but never consistently. The 10's camera however was the first (esp after 3 major camera updates) to actually MATCH UP with or be at about the same level as a Sony or Samsung camera. I get so much more detail and sharpness now than I ever did with the M8's camera. I recommend using the Auto HDR function. \n \r\nWith regard to screen clarity, I think the 10 is better there too. It has a 2K screen vs. the M8's 1080p screen. \n \r\nThe other major improvements of course were the 820 processor chip, which is SUPER fast, and maybe the biggest improvement was the speaker but esp the headphone audio! The M8's audio was very good, but only after I rooted it (ONLY phone I ever rooted) and got the Harman/Kardon mod for it. But the 10 is on a different level, putting even Sony's audio to shame. This article (below) talks more about it. It proves the 10 is without a doubt the best phone for audio out there (next to the LG V20, though I still prefer it OVER the V20 too). Read it and pay CLOSE attention to anything in bold, and focus especially on the headphone audio part. Dedicated DAC and dedicated headphone amp? THAT'S how you make a great audio smartphone!

So, when I saw there was an M10,  I assumed, surely I'll get all the wonderful things I like about the 8 PLUS whatever new additions in the 10!  Bad assumption. They moved the  speaker and reduced it to just one so now I need another device for louder sound, I absolutely get super annoyed with the camera to the point that I'm discouraged from taking pics, the screen clarity doesn't compare to that of the 8.

It's superior in EVERY way to the U Ultra AND cheaper too! Yeah U 11 is nice, though I still like the 10 more overall, including looks. \n \r\nThe U 11 is cool to me except: 1) Too big. I prefer non-phablet phones. 2) I don't like that they removed the 3.5mm headphone jack because that means you HAVE to use the included 3.5mm to USB-C adapter for audio (the adapter INCLUDES the great DAC and amp the 10 had built into itself). HTC claims the speakers on the U 11 sound louder because of the removal of that headphone jack, but I don't care. They should've just kept it. The 10's speakers are loud enough. 3) Glass back means you HAVE to use a case basically, unlike the 10 with the metal back. I don't want to use cases anymore. Tired of them. Even the clear ones mask the phone's good looks. 4) Speakers.........HTC needs to go back to Classic BoomSound with front-facing STEREO speakers! \n \r\nAlso...........1) Use a bigger battery for better battery life 2) Make a virtual fingerprint sensor like Apple and Samsung are for the iPhone 8 and Note 8. \n \r\nYeah I'm not a fan of Samsung. They ARE getting better and better though, but I still have my issues with them. One thing that's apparent is they don't seem to care much about sound quality. I DO, so that's a big problem for me. Also I don't care for their oversaturated Super AMOLED screens either, and their Settings menu is better now than S5's but still confusing. Their UI STILL lags too, where HTC and Sony's phones are fluid and quick. I would like to see HTC go \"18:9\" with the U 12 next year though. One thing HTC is bad at (Sony isn't though) is inner design. They waste a lot of space on the inside, which is why their phones are bigger than they need to be. For Samsung, I DO like Samsung Pay though. Was cool on my old S7 to have that, but that phone was overrated.

That sux, but at least you can still use the 10 for the most part. For one of the newer bands (Band 12, aka 700MHz), T-Mobile actually REQUIRES that phone companies get certified with them or else the phone won't be able to utilize VoLTE (which includes HD Voice). The issue there for me is that if VoLTE isn't available, T-Mobile won't allow the phone to use Band 12. So if I'm in an area that let's say ONLY gets Band 12 and not the other main bands (which are 2 & 4 for me), then I won't be able to make or take a call. So for me, it's an issue. Not sure how it is there though? But because of that, I'm doing everything I can to make sure the phones I get are T-Mobile certified. HTC OFFICIALLY certified the unlocked 10 with T-Mobile, so I'm GOOD to go there fortunately. \n\n \n \r\nYeah the U Ultra I don't think HTC certified with T-Mobile. The U 11 I think it might but I am not assuming anything until I get confirmation. But I'm not buying it anyway cuz I like my 10 better, so I guess it doesn't really matter anyway. \n \r\nI see. Well I'm glad Jio brought VoLTE there cuz that's good to have. It makes calls you make connect faster and have both a stronger connection and improves reception too I believe. \n \r\nYeah if U 11 gets VoLTE and 10 doesn't, then I can't argue that that's a good reason to buy it. The U 11 doesn't have the awesome DAC and amp inside of it like the 10 did. Instead, it's the ADAPTER that comes with it that has all that. So to get the BEST sound quality, you have to be using that adapter (3.5mm to USB-C). So far, I've confirmed the amp is very strong like the 10's, and the sound quality I've read is great too, though I'm still waiting for more detailed reviews on that front. Still, it has the great camera, 835 processor means MUCH faster data connections than what the 820 offers, 2K screen, Edge Sense, etc. \n \r\nThere's a Sprint store by me, so I may go check out the U 11 when it gets released next Friday (June 9th). Not to buy, but to check it out and hopefully get to try Edge Sense too. Sprint is the ONLY U.S. carrier that's officially selling the locked version of the phone. For all the rest we have to buy the unlocked version. I think that's dumb but whatever. HTC and Sony can't expect to ever really do well here w/o full major carrier support. Sprint is the WORST one of the major 4 carriers, so going with them is ok but not the best move. At least the unlocked versions work with the other 3, but it's still dumb. \n \r\nHaha yes!!

You can see the wipers animation cleaning the rain (on weather apps), clock choices widget apps, there I fell in love with Sense.\n \r\nAfter that came the cool rotating homescreen with sense 3.0 on Desire S, weather apps, where the cloud 3D effect was breathtaking, seriously lol. And photo gallery app with scrolling upside down animation.. That's just about the peak of high time of sense UI.\n \r\nAfter htc sensation, one X and m7, htc tried to de-sense, I lost some eye candy but I still can have a new feature like navigation button arrangement, instead of classic 3 button (back, home, recent apps) you can add screen off button which very useful since htc can only do double tap to wake and not to sleep like LG.\n \r\nOn Sense 8, htc removed bloats (seriously?) and deleted double apps which google already have. And this where things has gone too far. Htc sense is the most fluid android sense out there and heck, if bloatware is the public enemy then samsung will go bankrupt with its lagwiz lol. And google apps is flat ugly.\n \r\nI think htc lost it's identity in the process, and by choosing nexus or pixel way, they should put their deleted apps (music, clock, weather, etc) on playstore so give the people who loves them a choice. But they don't.\n \r\nThere's a lot of 3rd party apps out there try to mimicking sense. But their imitation aren't my taste, I want the genuine sense lol.

But that's cool. Glad you like it. Too bad the HTC 10 doesn't have it anymore, but I guess that's part of their attempt to remove \"bloat\". lol Poweramp is too dark?? Well there are other \"skins\" you can download that are probably brighter. I actually prefer the darker themes or skins because sometimes the white/bright ones can hurt my eyes. lol \n \r\nYeah I guess you have to with the 10! I got the new Alpha 704 \"beta\" version of Poweramp. It's a bit buggy with the album covers (doesn't always \"remember\" to switch when you change artists or albums), but it has a feature the official one doesn't which I love............you can enable 1% volume increments so instead of the volume shifting 5-7% everytime you push the up or down volume button, it just goes in 1% increments, which helps you get that PERFECT volume, which I absolutely LOVE, especially when listening on headphones. You can Google it if interested. The dev for Poweramp said he'll prob have the official version out (v3) by the end of this year. Hopefully he does so ON TIME! lol Already been a while since v2 was deployed (a couple years I'm guessing?).

Yes it is a software thing, correct. Haha........the AKG K550 or K551 will WIPE THE FLOOR with any Beats headphones or earphones. THAT'S a promise! lol You should just check on eBay or Amazon etc and see if you can find a good deal on one. You said you buy One phones from the U.S., so you should consider checking US eBay and Amazon too then perhaps, if interested. I actually just took a quick look now, and I found 2 sellers on eBay who are willing to ship those 2 headphones (in brand new condition) to Indonesia. See links below, again, if interested. Go to US eBay and search for \"AKG K550 MK II\". Choose \"New\" on left side filter menu. Then look for seller \"damannn20\" who's selling it for $126.99. Then open up another tab and do same thing (make sure to choose New again) but this time search for \"AKG K551\". Look for seller \"techronics-store\" who's selling black/silver K551 for $169.95. Both sellers looks reputable to me. \n \r\nNote: The K550 and K551 headphones sound like 99% the same, so let's just say they sound 100% the same. lol Also, the difference between the K550 and K550 MK II is really only the model name. The K550 was the U.S. version, while the K550 MK II was the UK/British version. I prefer the K550 MK II only because I like how the model name is written vertically on the side earcups vs. horizontally (the eBay pic shows it incorrectly. Google \"AKG K550 MK II\" for actual look.). Very minor thing. The difference b/t the K550 and K551 is that the K551 costs more but has a shorter cable (4 feet vs. 10 feet) + its cable has an in-line remote & microphone in it for calls, pause/play, volume adjustment, etc. But I think the K550 MK II looks SLIGHTLY cooler plus you can simply \"twisty tie\" the longer 10-foot cable. \n \r\nOh I see. Ok. Kinda like how people do it here in a party. lol\n \r\nYeah they got rid of that stuff so they could say there's less bloatware. lol You can just get a a third-party Gallery app or else a File Manager app and just go to the \"Pictures\" folder in it, which is what I do on my 10. For music............you should seriously consider Poweramp. It's the ONLY music app I've been using for years now, even though I'm constantly trying out other ones. But they never quite hit the mark the way Poweramp does. Either they don't sound as good or are not user-friendly. You should get Poweramp for both phones! lol (But you only have to pay for it once!) There's just some magical about how music sounds when played via Poweramp. It makes it sound better somehow than other apps. \n \r\nYeah like my cousin's wife got a Blackberry and it didn't have a Gallery app on it either so also no photo editing software. She didn't like that cuz she constantly likes to edit photos I guess. For me I don't care cuz I rarely do edits on pics and if I do I can just send it to my PC and do it from there if I actually need to, which is like NEVER. lol ", "date": "04 May 2017"}, {"text": "Rockstar, \n \r\nIt's 7.00 pm here, just get back from work and lay in my bed when writing this lol.\n \r\nThanks for your thorough explanation about the audio, you have sound knowledge in that dept. \r\nI think it's a software, just like beats audio on m7, \r\nI still have a pair of beats from it lol.\n \r\nIn my office we listen to music collectively, not private..

Didn't know Sprint had locked GSM capabilities! Sux they don't also offer 4G in your country, but wait so you can still get 4G LTE if you use the CDMA operator though?? Not sure I understand. \n \r\nYeah that's good that Verizon's phones are easy for you though at least. \n \r\nOk......if you MAINLY listen to music via the speakers, then yeah I'd prob go with M8 too. Usually ppl who listen at work do so on earphones or headphones, but that's cool you don't have to do that. That's cool about the Hi-Res headphones. Yes that is correct.......no Hi-Res earphones with my 10. It seems like we never get the \"cool extra bonus stuff\" that other countries do. At least not ALL the time. Yes, I got the HTC 10 for example but NOT Hi-Res earphones. To be honest with you I'd never use them anyway cuz I prefer headphones. I feel like you get better sound from them, but I've never tried really pricey ones though. Only pricey headphones. My AKG K551s are not that pricey though (about $170 now though I paid $200 for mine months ago), yet I found they sound better than some $300-$400 headphones I've pitted them against! If you ever get headphones, and want INCREDIBLE quality for not too much money, get the AKG K550 or K551. You may never go back to earphones again. LOL \n \r\nYeah when I had the rooted M8 with that H/K mod in it, I used Clari-Fi like 100% of the time. It definitely made the music sound better. My Sony phones had a feature like that too called DSEE HX. It essentially did the same thing.........it \"guessed\" how the mp3 song would sound if it were a CD-Quality of Hi-Res file, and made \"intelligent choices\" as how to render it. But it only works on mp3s as usually CDQ and Hi-Res files already sound better. But that's more to do with the fact that those other 2 (especially Hi-Res) always get BETTER masters than the mp3 versions get vs. the higher resolution. Not a lot of people know (or believe) that. But it's the truth. I've read studies and did my own blind ABX tests so I know it's true. Yeah I believe that too........the H/K mod made my regular M8 sound better and I'm pretty sure louder too, especially after reading what you just said. \n \r\nWow. You had a nice little SIDE business goin' on there it sounds like! lol Yeah I mean I didn't even KNOW that HTC made red One series phones before the 10. News to me! Well the enthusiasm going down for HTC is because of Samsung's rise but also because HTC doesn't do enough to ADVERTISE for itself anymore. I remember the M8 having MULTIPLE commercials on TV here. I haven't seen ANY ads for the M9 and definitely 10 on TV here AT ALL. People aren't gonna buy what they don't know, so when ppl see Samsung ads which are on all the time, of course they're gonna go with Samsung. It sux because I love HTC and Sony's phones THE MOST but they both are bad about marketing their phones here. HTC at least still has SOME carrier involvement. Sony cut all ties with the carriers here after the Z3, and now they not surprisingly sell LESS phones than they were before they stupidly did that. \n \r\nOn the 10 you mean? I dunno...........I don't even keep track anymore. It does go VERY fast though IMO. I guess Google is trying to use something different to replace QC, which is why the S8 is only QC 2.0 compatible and U 11 they say only 3.0, even though the 835 chip IS QC 4.0 compatible. Blahh whatever. QC 3.0 is just FINE for me! lol", "date": "04 May 2017"}, {"text": "Hi Rockstar, \r\nIt's 7.45 AM here and I guess it's late evening in chichago :)\n \r\nAbout Sprint, they have GSM capabilities but locked, so people here unlocked its GSM capability, and we can use it with Indonesian sim cards, but its LTE freq doesn't match, so we are limited to 3G only.  \r\nWe can get LTE using indonesian cdma operator tho. The GSM LTE freq here is 900/1800.\n \r\nOn the other hand, Verizon handsets are world phone, we don't need to unlock it, just insert the GSM or cdma SIM Card and voila, the signal is there :) \r\nBut to use tethering feature you need to root the phone.\n \r\nI listening to music thru external speakers A LOT, so the m8 wins over HTC 10 no question (I owned them both).  However while using earphones, I agree with you that  HTC10 have  advantages over M8. I have hi-res earphone in the 10 box, and it delivers great sound. I heard US version don't have hi-res earphone in the package?\n \r\nThe great feature of H/K m8 is Clari-Fi, it essentially restore the quality of compressed audio.The sound is crisp and every detail is clear. And H/K version have louder audio output than regular M8, I compared them side by side that's why I moved from RED verizon M8 (which colour i like most) to Sprint M8 h/k lol.\n \r\nYeah I sold m7 sprint RED everytime I can buy them. Essentially I emptied the market and buy every mint condition m7 RED available lol. Back then, HTC is quite popular and many use them, quite easy to sell them because RED is also RARE stuff. Now only few people using HTC flagship here in Indonesia and that trend is world wide that's why HTC is in trouble. People can list HTC10 camelia RED in OLX for days and it hasn't sold. The enthusiasm isn't there anymore.. :(\n \r\nAnd oh, regarding the QC 3.0 I only manages to get 50% after 1 hour of charging. How is your experience? \n \r\nCheers!", "date": "04 May 2017"}, {"text": "Rafe, \n \r\nOh ok. So you went from Red to Grey/Black. Nice! Yeah those updates made a difference. lol When I compared the 10 to S7 and X Performance, pics I took of like blu-ray movie cases didn't come out as detailed as the other 2 phones' did. Like when I zoomed in on the cases the words were blurry, but were in focus on the other 2. But when I took similar pics on the 10 the 2nd time around (in January, after 2 of the 3 updates had been deployed), the detail was there which made me very happy. \n \r\nThat IS odd, because here the Verizon and Sprint phones are ONLY available as locked. HTC states their unlocked phones for the US are GSM network-based, which means AT&T and T-Mobile (I have T-Mobile). Verizon and Sprint are CDMA network-based, so it's different there. My assumption then is that in Indonesia you guys MUST run on CDMA then if you're using phones designated here for Verizon & Sprint. Interesting. What's more odd is that you're getting the \"unlocked only\" color choices on those phones for Verizon and Sprint, which always have LIMITED color options here. Very strange!! I really can't explain that one. \n \r\nInteresting...............I would suggest though that you use the HTC 10 for music listening. The Harmon/Kardon (or H/K) M8 was great for 2014, but the 10's audio capabilities are FAR more advanced. Just see the article below. I'd compared my 10 to my $299 Oppo HA-2 premium amp/DAC device (   ), and it matched if not outdid the HA-2 in both sound quality and volume. So I sold off my HA-2 and now just connect my headphones (AKG K551) DIRECTLY to the 10. The audio is THAT good on it, so seriously consider what I said. \n\n   (If the U 11 DOESN'T have this level of sound quality or better, then I'm 100% NOT getting it! lol. See headphones section and parts in bold too.) \n \r\nThen again, if you're ONLY listening from the speakers, then the H/K M8 MIGHT be better? Not sure. You should compare the speakers on both phones and see, or maybe you already did that? For headphone listening though, 100% for sure go with the 10. Funny you mention the H/K version. When I got the M8 3 years ago, it was the regular one, but I found out the only difference b/t that one and the H/K version (which was a Sprint only \"exclusive\" here, and I had T-Mobile) was with the software, NOT the hardware. So someone came up with a mod which if you root your phone, you could install to make the regular M8 an H/K version. So for the first (and last lol) time ever, I rooted my phone and installed that mod, and DID notice a difference in quality from the regular one. I was very happy with that phone for like 6-8 mos, then the Sony Xperia Z3 came out which was better so I upgraded. Now Sony's phones are only better on camera. For battery life and especially audio, they have fallen way behind HTC. HTC is even catching up on camera, especially since they switched from the Toshiba camera sensors (which Sony bought that business out from them) to the Sony ones........starting with the 10. \n \r\nHow did you get the extra units to sell?? lol Did you just buy them and resell them at a higher price there in your country? I see about Sprint and no LTE vs. Verizon having it. Yeah I switched to T-Mobile about 3 years ago (February 2014), and never looked back. They have grown SO quickly here and give you so much more value for what you pay for (pay less, get MORE) than Verizon did, so I have NO plans to ever go back to Verizon again. The reason why Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint are more competitive now with pricing and features has A LOT to do with T-Mobile, so people here should appreciate that. \n \r\nHaha yeah I knew you didn't have Uh-Oh, so I guess it's more of a risk for you. Not sure how it will work if someone wants to put a case on it. Maybe HTC will offer \"special cases\" to people that are custom-made for the U 11? The newest leak indicates that the body may not be metal but perhaps either glass or else I'm HOPING a glass/metal hybrid. It says: \"Fluid and reflective; designed to be quiet no more.\" The \"quiet no more\" part indicates they may be trying something new since the U Ultra DOES have a glass back, so hopefully if it's not metal it's metal/glass.

I also dislike phablet phones, so I wasn't too thrilled to hear the U 11 would have a 5.5\" screen. Depending on a few factors (definitely audio), I may or may not get it. But the problem is the TREND seems to be for flagships that they are getting bigger and bigger, so if I want to continue having flagships, then I may not have a choice? 5.5\" isn't THAT bad I guess if you don't use a case. I used cases for years but last month or two I've been trying my 10 without the case. I like it better overall this way.

They should sell the U 11 at $600-$650, NOT $700-750. HTC doesn't have the same kind of presence that Apple and Samsung do, but if they sold their phones a little lower, they could GRAB more attention to their phones and most likely sell more phones and make a nice profit as well. They need to start doing more to market/advertise their phones to here in the U.S. People won't buy phones they've never heard of, at least most won't.

That would be cheaper because it's older. There's also the new Sony Xperia XZs which just got released I think this week?

Ok I C.\n \r\nMy sister had the M9. I thought it looked really nice and basically was the same as the M8 but better (love the 2-tone color one which is what she had........silver & gold, which was inspired by luxury watches). The only issue with the M9 IMO was the camera was really no better than the M8's was, which was inconsistently good at best. HTC was still using Toshiba camera sensors back then, which weren't the best like Sony's are. Shortly after Sony BOUGHT OUT Toshiba's camera sensor business though and did so early enough so HTC would begin using Sony's sensors on the 10 and thereafter. So that's yet ANOTHER reason to get the 10 b/c the camera sensor is better. The 10 even TIED the Samsung S7 and Sony X Performance for OVERALL camera quality on DxOMark (see link below, right side.......\"88\"). After getting THREE major camera updates since its release, I can say the camera on the 10 is VERY GOOD TO GREAT and more consistent than past One phones were. \n\n \n \r\nI was (and still slightly am) a huge fan of Sony, but like I said in my last post, they've let me down too many times. I had the Sony Xperia Z3 and it was arguably the best phone ever, but they had some kind of bug in Stamina Mode that caused issues with MMS texts in that I wouldn't always get them. You know how many times I had to embarrass myself and ask ppl to resend a text I found out they'd send but I didn't get? It soured my experience with that phone.........wasn't until I found an app called 360 Hibernation Master (which doesn't even work on ANY new phone anymore) that I got the battery life I wanted and could keep SM off, which finally fixed the problem. Had the phone 1 1 /2 years and only REALLY enjoyed the last 3-4 mos. The X Perf was a real let down b/c I realized shortly after I'd passed up the 10 last summer for the X Perf that the NEW Sony phones NO LONGER have the awesome 2-day battery life they did with the Z series. Sony doesn't even bother advertising it anymore either if you've noticed. Again, the only thing I'd say they have going for them is the camera, but it's NOT THAT much better than the 10's at all. Even now they're releasing the XZs on Wednesday for $699 and it still has the 820 chip??! Total ripoff. Wait a month for the HTC 11 and I think THAT will be an incredible phone. But honestly, I'm SO happy with my 10 I may not even upgrade this year. We'll see. \n \r\niPhone? Up to you man.

I dunno if it's more fluid, but I WILL say it's at least AS FAST as my Sony Xperia X Performance was. I mean it's VERY fast and loads up everything and downloads & installs updates VERY quickly too, etc. \n \r\nI sold my X Perf for the 10 for the following reasons: \n \r\n1) I compared my X Perf to my $299 Oppo HA-2 amp/DAC, and it could NOT match it in terms of sound quality, but the 10 DID. Shortly after I sold off my XP AND Oppo! Now I just connect my headphones STRAIGHT to my phone. So much easier than before. Unlike the X Perf, the 10 comes with a DEDICATED DAC and DEDICATED headphone amp for incredible audio quality. Sony used to have this set up on their phones but now they've gone cheap and try to market \"Hi-Res\" on their phones but resolution doesn't matter, it's having great components & parts that does. \n \r\n1) HTC treats its U.S. customers better, gives us a phone in the 10 that offers U.S. customers VoLTE, which I could no longer get with Sony phones b/c they're too cheap pay T-Mobile to run their certification test on their phones to make it enabled. HTC wasn't too cheap and so now my calls connect faster and are stronger b/c of VoLTE. Also, with VoLTE I'll be able to use the Band 12/700 mHz spectrum which requires VoLTE in order use it on T-Mobile's network. That means if I'm in an area that ONLY gets Band 12, with Sony I wouldn't be able to make or take calls, but with HTC I am. \n \r\n3) Slightly better battery life on the 10. \n \r\n4) Though the camera on the Sony is still slightly better, the 10 has gotten VERY close after 3 major camera updates were deployed to it. \n \r\n5) With HTC, by buying THROUGH HTC.com, I get 1 year free Uh-Oh Protection. So I save money by cancelling my phone insurance for that year and after that I can get it back or get private insurance via like Worth Ave Group, etc. \n \r\nI couldn't recommend the 10 more. And I WAS a huge Sony fan, but things have changed. With Sony I had to buy the int'l X Perf JUST to get a working fingerprint scanner.

Its ruggedness, super fast processor speed,good battery backup, Fast charging and good finger print sensor exceptionally faster than iPhone 6S. 2TB of expandable memory.

I also am in charge of purchasing for where I work & purchase hundreds of HTC phones a year. So when you look at the business I give HTC it is about 30 grand a year. \r\n This review is for my personal HTC phone. I purchased a HTC 10 through Sprint with one of those leasing plans in July. My phone just stopped working for no reason. One morning it was charged 100%, I made a phone call, put the phone down & 10 minutes later went to make another call & the phone was off. Never could get it on again. So I thought the Uhh Ohh protection would be a great idea.So I sent my barely used, in perfect condition phone to HTC. Last Saturday I received back a Frankenstein phone(buildaphone), spent 5 hrs on the phone with sprint trying to activate the phone. The meid & imei were completely different numbers instead of being one number off.  I finally talked to a 3rd level engineer & he said no way this phone can be added to sprints database, even though it boots up & says sprint it is a gsm phone not cdma, he told me to call htc & tell them so send another phone. So I did & they told me their rma dept was not open until Monday. Instead of shipping me a new phone. So I called first thing Monday & they submitted a ticket to their escalation dept, told me I would hear back in 3-5 days!!!! No I am not joking any other company would have next day the phone because they screwed up. Not HTC!!!Oh & the lady asked me if I bought my phone at Walmart & if it was prepaid?! No it was a sprint phone that's what I sent you. What you sent back is not my phone at all.It is now a week later & I still have not heard from them, I still don't have a phone that works & I am still paying for a phone. I called again today & was told I have to wait to hear back from their escalations department. Anyone have any advice???? This is ridiculous, how does a company treat its customers like this?

My provider told me after I had dropped my m9 in some water that they no longer carried the m9 and I would have to get an m10 but he never told me how awful the m10 is.  I was thinking it was going to be an upgrade but to my surprise this phone runs like complete shit the internet usage (internet or 4g) is so slow.  And the fact that this phone has a charge port that is not a micro USB might be the most depressing thing ever. That means you have the charger that comes with it and that's it.  If you lose that charger if you break the inside charge part on the inside of your phone,  then what?  Yeah not much you can do but just change phones at that point.  I mean sure it's gimmick is that it charges fast but you know what it also does?  It only stays charged for a total of maybe 5-6 hours.  And thats brand new. So yeah if I wanna sit here and just keep putting my phone back on the charger after every 5 hours that's be great but I don't.  And I can't see why anyone would,  and not to mention that fact you'll have to keep your stupid charger with you at all times.  Because it's not like you'll be able to barrow someone else's.  People say the reason they like this phone is because of the sound but I could give less of a fuck I just want a phone that works.  My m9 worked great and had nothing but positives this phone is a DOWNGRADE by every meaning of the word.

(Only 2,400 mah for a 5.2\" screen). \r\nWith the HTC 10 I still experience battery issues and can get mostly about 4 hours of screen-on time. I am not a heavy user, I usually just browse Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and open the camera every once in a while. \r\nHTC boasted with a \"2 day battery\" but it wouldn't last me even for half a day. \r\nOther than that, the camera tends to overexpose pictures sometimes, especially in daylight, and night shots usually come up blurry, even though it has an OIS. \r\nMultimedia wise, I can say that the speaker is a bit weaker than the BoomSound speakers I have on my HTC Desire Eye. No idea why HTC decided to drop the boomsound in their flagship model but, what can you do about it? Personally I'd rather get a Full HD screen with better speakers than the 4K display which basically has no benefit in terms of performance. I also find myself usually toggling battery saver mode on for longer battery life, but the screen is rather dark in the battery saver mode (the screen itself isn't bright at all in general, good luck with the sunlight), so I have to compromise. \r\nDesign wise, the phone looks good, I like the metal feel (even though it gets hotter beause of it), the fingerprint sensor is usually fast, but I don't like the sides of the phone - they're not curved enough and if you won't put a case, you'll feel the roughness in your hands while holding it. They should have had gone with the 2.5D bezels. \r\nAnd one last thing - I can't see anything on the screen with my polarized sunglasses! That's a major letdown and everytime I want to take a peek at the phone I have to remove my glasses. Overall I've paid 700$ for the device but I don't think that the value justifies it. I would have went with the Galaxy S7 but I'm a media user and the S7 doesn't have high volume while lisening to music via earphones, which is an important thing for me.

I guess Samsung, Sony or LG will now get my money...", "date": "27 Jul 2016"}, {"text": "I bought HTC 10 in India 3 days back. Its an awesome phone. Will recommend to all. I really feel bad for HTC that they are not able to sell this phone in good numbers. People are really ignorant about this phone.  \r\nLet me tell you how I decided on buying this phone. But first let me tell my experience about my previously owned phones. I had bought Note 1 in Feb 2012 and after using it for 1.5 years it started having issues of random reboots and it happened every now and then when I was browsing or having phone calls. When I visited their service station the guys over there told me that motherboard was faulty and needed to be replaced which would have cost INR 10k. This is the quality of Samsung flagship phones. Also by this time phone was extremely laggy and slow. Then I decided to buy a new phone instead of spending so much on slow laggy phone. So I bought HTC One M7 in Aug 2013 and let me tell you its was a beast when it came to day to day operations. For 2 years it was running butter smooth. Only after I upgraded to Lollipop things had become a big laggy but that was only observed few times. Still its fast when you compare a 3 year old device. My sister has galaxy S3 which is 3.5 years old is its slow as snail. Also she had to change mother board twice (during warranty period) and this is her 3rd battery in her phone. Compared to that battery on HTC One M7 is so good even after 3 years. It can last up to 2-3 hours of screen on time. Also I keep my phone charging for the entire night still no issues like low performance or bloating of battery which is common on Samsung phones. \r\nNow let me tell you about my journey of buying this gem of a phone. I had decided on upgrading to a new phone this year so from past few months I have been constantly watching reviews and comparison videos on youtube. I was confused between S7 edge and HTC 10. My wife was suggesting me to go for Oneplus 3 as it was cost effective. I had almost finalized on Oneplus 3 soft gold edition but then I saw many negative comments on Amazon and gsmarena about the quality of the phone like fast draining of the battery, issue with finger print scanner when kept in pockets facing leg side, defective display etc. So this phone was now out of option. Now I had almost made up mind on S7 edge as it had superior screen and camera as compared to HTC 10. But again I knew how laggy the phones get in 1 year. Also I read in many user reviews that the phone was extremely fragile and the screen or glass back  would easy break or scratch with small falls. So if I had decided to buy this I would have to use a case which would make the phone bulky which I never liked. Also its a finger print magnet both back and screen and it looks so awful cover with fingerprints all over.  Also in many user reviews (gsmarena) I read how the screen would have issues (faulty)on a newly bought phone or issues related to wifi, rebooting, lagging, even water damage considering its water resistant and can stay submerged in water upto 30 mins etc.  So finally I decided to go for  HTC 10. And I can say I made a smart decision. Now coming to this beautiful phone below are some things I observed: \r\n1. Built quality: Extremely awesome. Can beat any phone in the world when compared to built quality even Iphone. Extremely durable. Watch drop test on youtube for this. It feels so premium in hand. Those big chamfered edges on the back its feels like a piece of jewellery. \r\n2. Display: If you dont compare the display with amoled (S7 edge) screens then its way too awesome. Good brightness with high clarity and vivid colours. I would rate this display 9/10. \r\nThere is issue with polarised sun glasses though for some models. When you view in portrait mode then visibility is almost reduced to 10%. You will need to look in landscape mode or turn the brightness to 100%. But this is not observed on all models only few. So it depends on your luck which model you get. \r\n3. Performance and Software: I have no words for it. Everything opens in an instant, Its butter smooth. UI so user friendly and simple. You can customise each and everything from wall paper to icons etc. Its extremely fast. Sense has always been the no 1 skin on android and it continues to do so. There is 0 bloat ware and you can disable the unwanted apps. I bet you cannot complain in this department and HTC is way ahead in terms of competition when its comes to software. \r\n4. Battery: I am getting screen on time of more that 5 hours which I feel is good. Yesterday with moderate use battery reduced from 100% to 11% in 14 hrs 30 mins which is more than full day. So I don't think anybody can complain in this department as well. Also you have quick charge. It charged from 11% to 94% in 1 hour which is extremely fast. So no worries in this department as well. Yes the phones become warm while fast charging but its ok. Its not unbearable and can be overlooked.  \r\n5. Camera: Main camera is also good though I did not get a chance of taking too many photos I think is among the top 5 contenders of this year. Selfie camera is on the top, better than that of S7 edge. I can say you wont be disappointed with the camera as well. Even if you watch videos on youtube you would observe sometimes it takes better shots even compared to S7 edge or other phones in this category.\n \r\nOnly negative thing I feel about this phone is the price which is INR 52990 which I feel is a bit high. Considering all mid range phones come in metal and have similar specs. Also HTC is not doing so well they should have kept prices 5K to 10K less than the completion which would have helped them to get good sales. Also I was getting S7 edge in INR 51290 considering 10% cash back and normal S7 was about INR 44K this phone feels overpriced which is hurting its sales. HTC should do something in this area.\n", "date": "27 Jul 2016"}, {"text": "No one will answer you about this question because I have also asked this question several times and I am also waiting for Dual SIM model of this set.

The battery life id imagine is good, but for a heavy user like myself i have to charge my phone about once, sometimes twice a day. Be careful in the summer, if it is really hout out and you have your phone in a case the volume buttons bend, and the charging port can also stop working after a while. I have had both of these happen and already gotten a replacement phone and charger from HTC. Screen quality is stunning, call quality is very crisp and easy, build quality is great and feels amazing in hand, not too light or heavy, quick charge has been such a life saver, you can charge your phone from zero to one hundred in one hour while heavily using it.

When you take your phone out of the box, while there are plenty of settings you can tweak, you can only alter what the manufacturer and carrier allows you to. By gaining root access you can modify the device's software on the very deepest level. It takes a bit of hacking (some devices more than others), it voids your warranty, and there's a small chance that you could completely break your phone forever. However, some people take that risk so they can enjoy the benefits of rooting.\n \r\nRooting offers these abilities:\n \r\n1. Install OS (operating system) updates when you want to without having to wait for a release from your carrier. However, you have to go find and download that update that someone puts online to use. (Risky)\n \r\n2. Change phone settings that normal users can't change because the manufacturer does not want you to tinker with setting that deeply. HTC is one of the few manufacturers that allows for \"developer options\" without having to root your phone and it does not void your warranty.\n \r\n3. Not having to use the \"skin\" provided by the manufacturer. For example, if you root a Samsung phone and hate their Touchwiz \"skin\", you can install any skin you want into the phone. However, this can and often does disable some features of the phone. Camera software can stop working, etc etc.\n \r\n4. Get rid of APPS you don't want. Some carriers and manufacturers will preinstall their own apps that they don't allow you to remove. This is called \"bloat\". The HTC 10 has done a FANTASTIC job of getting rid of bloat. It uses mainly only essential Google apps and ALL of them can be removed without rooting.\n \r\nThere are other reasons to root a phone that mainly tweak the performance by messing with system settings, but for the day to day average user, you do not need to root. \n \r\nIf you want a phone that allows you to do 90% of the things rooting allows you to without having to root, then buy the HTC 10.

You can not satisfied 100% people. Apple & Samsung uses bottom firing single speaker but people's are not complaining about that. But they criticized HTC's speakers, though it is the market's best sound system till now.. understand?", "date": "23 Apr 2016"}, {"text": "My post was deleted from before and I am not quite sure why.\n \r\nI received my preordered HTC 10 on the 16th of April in Taiwan, where I live.I bought the dark grey with black front version.\n \r\nWhen I first opened the box I was in love. The HTC 10 is a strikingly handsome phone. It has now been roughly 6 full days that I have been using the HTC 10 and these are my thoughts:\n \r\nThe Great:\n \r\n1. Solid, well crafted body. The phone looks and feels stunning.\n \r\n2. Sound quality from the earphones is phenomenal! \n \r\n3. UI is fast, slick and minimal.\n \r\n4. It charges super fast.\n \r\nThe Good:\n \r\n1. The battery lasts  a solid day with normal usage. (Calls, internet surfing, picture taking, light streaming of music)\n \r\n2. The photo quality from both cameras is better than any other camera HTC has made so far.\n \r\n3. The fingerprint reader works really well and is very responsive.\n \r\nThe Okay:\n \r\n1. The phone feels bulky. It has heft to it and the edges start to feel a bit sharp.\n \r\n2. The power button is a bit overly textured. \n \r\n3. The internal speakers (tweeter and sub woofer) deliver loud sound but not stereo sound. The speakers lack the sound quality of the M7 or M8. They have the volume power, just not the quality.\n \r\nThe Bad:\n \r\n1. The laser auto focus was buggy out of the box. It kept popping up an error message that it was being blocked and it wont let you take the picture. HTC has since sent out a camera software update and it kind of fixed the problem. The error is now infrequent, but still happens in low light.\n \r\n2. The video and audio will sometimes stutter when a lot is going on at the same time; ie: streaming a video while downloading an app while having a few applications open in the background and having the volume on high. \n \r\n3. Overheating. The phone got very hot a few times. Mostly when I was streaming video or playing a game.\n \r\n4. The positioning of the tactile buttons on either side of the fingerprint reader is much too low. I found myself missing them when trying to select them. I needed to tap a couple times to hit the right spot. There is just a lot of \"dead space\" above the buttons. I guess that is a very minor issue as it is something that just needs getting used to.\n \r\nI did contact HTC Support about the laser focus errors, overheating and stuttering problems. They said to return the phone to them for a replacement.  I want to hold onto the phone for a couple more days and see if the problems persist or resolve themselves. \n \r\nAll in all, I am pleased with my purchase and I do like the phone a lot. I would recommend the HTC 10 to audiophiles, people who love a solid, handsome metal phone and anyone still using the M7, M8 or M9 as a worthy upgrade. I just hope the few problems will be fixed.\n\n", "date": "23 Apr 2016"}, {"text": "I think people should be prepared in knowing that the HTC 10 does not have stereo speakers anymore. Yes, it has a tweeter and sub woofer, but the sound output really is flatter...more monotone.

Metal back with antenna bands which HTC revealed on February 19, 2013 in New York and London. The iPhone 6 had a similar design and was revealed on September 9, 2014. Apple and HTC have agreements between them, which may or may not be related to the metal back with antenna lines.\n \r\nEither way, the HTC 10 is far less likely to be mistaken for an iPhone than the HTC A9.\n \r\nThe big news, for many, is camera. I was hoping it would at least be decent, but I was not expecting it to be suddenly sharing the number one spot on the Dxomark ratings.  Now granted, Dxomark rating only highlights the technical abilities of a camera, and are not the be-all end-all (we have real world usage for that!). However, it does tell us that it is technically good, and the early reviews seem to back that up. Who would have thought that an HTC camera would be sitting on top of Mount Everest sharing a hot thermos of coffee with the Galaxy S7?\n \r\nAs someone who puts phones through the ringer as a part of my job as an engineer, I can lay out some basics about the internals: The battery life will be good. HTC claims 2 days, and in light of the M8 battery tests for which I have the data sheet for, the 10 doing two days with moderate use is on target. We typically got 1.5 days on the M8 with \"I don't care\" usage, and 2 days in moderate use, and the M8 has a smaller 2,600 mAh battery. Performance will be slightly better than other phones with the exact same SOC, because HTC has always done a bit better, even without cheating ;)\n \r\nAudio wise, I'll have to hear it. I will miss having stereo in my face when playing games and watching movies, but for people that set their phone down and expect it to fill the room, the subwoofer will be nice. From the headphone jack, it will be very good, and I'm interested if it can unseat the M8, which is still king of the hill after two years (the LG V10 came close). I have the full spreadsheets listing all the top phones, so it will be easy to see when the HTC 10 testing is complete. For those of you that have not experienced HTC with a set of good headphones, and who do not plan on getting one, I suggest that you don't try them out if you have a \"normal\" phone.

Yes the HTC M10's Chipset, CPU and GPU are better then Oneplus 2, but nobody is saying \"WOW\" because HTC did a poor job on the other specs.\n \r\nAnd I'm just comparing HTC with OnePlus, because comparing HTC with LG or Samsung won't be a fair match.\n \r\nLike many others, HTC has again 1 fan less and I'm considering to go for either LG G4 Pro or LG G5, because both have better specs in many other areas then the HTC M10.\n \r\nWish you all the best luck HTC.", "date": "18 Feb 2016"}, {"text": "& I wish that HTC will remain the sapphire glass for the main camera like what they did on one (m9)", "date": "18 Feb 2016"}, {"text": "i love htc love  i wish this phone have a version for 5.5 but if not i buy it anyway ", "date": "15 Feb 2016"}, {"text": "LTE Cat6 300/50 Mbps No no....
