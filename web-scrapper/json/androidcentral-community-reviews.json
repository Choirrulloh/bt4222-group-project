[{"title": "[PREVIEW] Griffin Survivor Series Cases for the Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+", "thread": [{"postID": "post6189025", "text": "There may be the name \u201cGriffin\u201d, in this opening paragraph, but don\u2019t let that mislead you into thinking that I\u2019ll be talking about Gryffindor, or Harry Potter. I\u2019m here to talk to you about the new case lineup from the case manufacturer, Griffin. I recently did a review of one of their products for the iPhone, and I decided I wanted to get my hands on some of their cases to showcase for the new Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+. One of the hardest parts about getting a new phone is trying to figure out what case you want to get on launch day so that you have everything you need to keep your phone safe and stylish. I am ever more wary about Amazon reviews as the days go by, so hopefully I can clear up the air a little bit and offer some fresh insight on a great selection of options for your new Sammy device.\nGriffin has been around for a long time, and they make a wide selection of cases for most phone manufacturers. In the phone case world, there are so many different cases to choose from that sometimes it\u2019s hard to get past the front-page ads on websites and find something new, or different that\u2019s worth taking the risk. In days of old, many a time I went straight to my old tried-and-true cases for $10-15, not wanting to spend much money on a case, and I certainly don\u2019t blame you if that\u2019s your M.O. (\"Modus Operandi\", for those of you who ever wondered what that stands for.) However, there were always cases in the $20-30 range that I always wondered about, and considered purchasing but was afraid to because I didn\u2019t want to waste my money. Well, if you\u2019re on the fence and want to try something new to go with your new S9/S9+, here\u2019s a new selection of cases that might be worth exploring. Say hello to the Survivor series by Griffin.Survivor Strong:\nFirst and foremost, we have the Survivor Strong. Out of the three cases, the Survivor Strong is the most rigid, and protective of the three cases in this preview. It has a very hard outer-shell (made from polycarbonate), and rigid bumper protection that will keep your phone safe from drops, slips, and getting squished or smashed between things. It\u2019s a solid one-piece design that\u2019s designed to give you a slim profile, but isn\u2019t slim on protection. The overall grip on the case is solid and even though I don\u2019t have the S9+ yet to try it out on, I\u2019m anxious to see how it fits. The Survivor Strong has been drop-tested on concrete, and is MIL-STD rated to protect your phone from drops up to 7ft. I really like how Griffin went the extra mile with all three of these cases to highlight the fact that the phones were dropped on concrete. Other phone cases don\u2019t ever say what they are designed to be dropped on, so it\u2019s reassuring and comforting to know that these guys have been dropped on concrete and still keep you rolling. And even though the case keeps damage at bay, it still allows the warm and fuzzy wireless charging waves through its rough exterior to allow you to charge your phone without plugging it in. The Survivor Strong is available on Griffintechnology.com, and is currently priced at $29.99. This case is available in two different color options: Grey/Pink, and Navy/Coral Blue. Survivor Clear Wallet:\nNext we have the Survivor Clear Wallet edition. While it may be clear, it also has a cool Black-colored folio cover that flips over the front. The folio cover also doubles as a wallet/card holder, enabling you to show up to three different cards, for ease and convenience. The back-side of the case is of course clear and allows you to show off the dazzling new S9/S9+ color that you decided to purchase. What color did you decide on? Regardless of the color, it\u2019s sure to look fantastic pared with the black bumpers and snazzy folio cover that allows you to keep your screen protected on the go. In addition to style and convenience, the Survivor Clear edition also offers a little bit of drop protection, which helps make the package even sweeter. The Survivor Clear offers 4ft of drop protection (on concrete), and also allows for wireless charging. If you think that this is the case for you, you can find it on Griffin\u2019s website for $24.99, and it is only available in Clear/Black.Survivor Clear:\nLast but not least is the Survivor Clear, which is an unsung favorite of mine that I\u2019ve already had the privilege to use on my iPhone X (full review coming soon). I\u2019m a big fan of clear-style TPU cases, because they give you solid protection, yet still allow you to keep the slim-form factor. Another reason I love them so much is because it allows me to keep my phone in a natural\u2019esque state, which lets me show off the cool new color that I\u2019ve chosen for my phone. In the age of cases and phone protection, it seems harder and harder to justify carrying around a phone without a case \u2013 and I certainly don\u2019t advise it. But protecting your phone comes at a cost\u2026 you can\u2019t show it off its natural beauty and glory; unless of course your use a clear case. Well, the Survivor Clear does a great job of giving you the best of both worlds. Not only is your phone safe and secure with 4ft of drop protection, you can still power on with both wireless charging and the cool \u201cnaked\u201d look on your phone \u2013 and who doesn\u2019t want to show off their new Samsung phone? They\u2019re gorgeous. If you\u2019re interested in picking up one of these sweet TPU cases, you can check it out on Griffin\u2019s website for $19.99. Of course, it only comes in one color\u2026 well, not really a color. It\u2019s clear Conclusion: Each of these cases does a great job at keeping your phone protected, while simultaneously giving you several different style, and color options to choose from. The prices are pretty well on-par with other similarly marketed products, and the level of protection that you get is reputable. You really can\u2019t go wrong with either of these three options. If you have any questions please feel free to leave them down in the comment section, and I will follow up later on down the road with more review information once I actually get to test them out on my new S9+.", "time": "03-13-2018 10:15 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "[REVIEW] Anker SoundCore 2 BlueTooth Speaker", "thread": [{"postID": "post6188506", "text": "One of the things I\u2019ve been trying to do over the last six months is branch out and broaden my horizons on the types of things that I review. In this endeavor I have reviewed quite a few pairs of different earphones and headphones recently, but this is the first time I\u2019ve ever reviewed a Bluetooth speaker, so you\u2019re in for a treat. This item is the SoundCore 2, by Anker. I\u2019ve reviewed a couple of Anker\u2019s earphones and I was impressed with the varying levels of power and clarity that they offer in such an inexpensive package. Logically, I decided to go back to the Anker well once again and give their SoundCore 2 speaker a chance, and I\u2019m glad that I did.\nSound Quality: The overall sound quality that this baby cranks out is solid, and well-balanced. This is the kind of speaker that you can use just about anywhere. Not only does it produce easy listening tunes while you\u2019re at the office, but you can take it home and fire it up for the after-work party as well \u2013 and do it all one the same charge! The power range and balance are good at low volume as well as at full-blast, which is an exceptional trait in audio accessories. Usually you get great high-level volume, or you get quality sound at the lower-end/normal listening volume. From other speakers that I\u2019ve tried out before or owned, it always seemed like they couldn\u2019t shift gears and take things up or down a notch when you need to, but the SoundCore 2 pulls this off really well. I made sure to put the speaker through my gambit of different types of music that I like to listen to, and I was happy with pretty much all of it. The most notable areas of performance on this speaker are vocals, bass, and balance. The bass drum sounds clear and has a good sound, not just a beat. The bass doesn\u2019t carry or have as much boom as some other products that I\u2019ve used before that cater to bass enthusiasts, but the SoundCore 2 still performs well in this area, I think the best sound that I got out of this speaker was listening to some 80\u2019s tunes. If you\u2019re a Billy Idol, or Van Halen fan, then you\u2019ll really enjoy the eclectic sound reproduction that comes out of these drivers. The voice and guitar blends of some classic 80\u2019s hair band music really pops, and sounds great. If you really want to get a feel for what the SoundCore 2 has to offer then fire up some AC/DC and listen to the hi-hats in the beginning and you\u2019ll be hooked, especially once the guitar and vocals kick in.\nFunctionality: The speaker is crazy easy to use. At first, I thought the big buttons on top were a little silly looking, but then I started using them and appreciated the simplicity that they offer. Really, there are 5 buttons on the whole speaker: Volume Up, Volume Down, Power, Play (doubles as Pause), and Bluetooth Pairing. The only other thing you have to worry about is the rubberized cover on the side that you move out of the way to charge this baby, which you don\u2019t have to do often. The \u201cPower\u201d in PowerCore, stands for more than just volume. The battery life on this speaker is fantastic, like many of Anker\u2019s other products. Their accessories are all well-balanced when it comes to power consumption and performance, giving you the best of both worlds. The product has an advertised play-life of 24hrs \u2013 holy smokes! It\u2019s also water-resistant, which is a plus if you want to listen to music while you\u2019re laying out by the pool. Of course, it isn\u2019t waterproof, but it will withstand getting splashed periodically. In addition to being an awesome speaker, you can even use it for phone calls. The SoundCore 2 has a built-in mic that allows you to answer phone calls in the middle of listening to your music without having to worry about tracking down your phone. It\u2019s a really nice feature that I enjoyed a lot. Last but not least, Anker was nice enough to throw in 3.5mm auxiliary port as well, in case you find yourself in a position where you need to go the old-fashioned wired route. \nAdditional Features and Specs: \n- Rated at \u201cup to\u201d 24 hours of playtime (wowsers!), which is based on volume level.\n- Fully charges in 3 hours.\n- 33ft connectivity range\n- Built-in microphone for phone calls \u2013 seriously, this is cool\n- Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity with a 66ft listening range\n- Comes with a tiny charging cable and no base.Conclusion: The Anker SoundCore 2 Bluetooth speaker is a great piece of audio tech. The multi-function capability of the speaker combined with ease-of-use, and all-around sound performance give this little guy lots of check marks in my book. It sounds great and goes for hours on end without skipping a beat. One hang-up with Bluetooth accessories is that they die too often, or at the most inconvenient time; not this speaker. The only reason it will likely ever die is because it lasts for so long that you forgot to charge it the day before. I give it two thumbs up! \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one of these sweet little speakers, you can check them out on Anker\u2019s website: https://www.anker.com/products/varia...eaker/A3105011 \u2013 they are currently priced at $39.99. They are also available for purchase through Amazon. The SoundCore 2 comes in one color: Black.", "time": "03-12-2018 09:54 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Mujjo Touchscreen Gloves: Touch All the Things (Or Maybe Don't)", "thread": [{"postID": "post6185505", "text": "We\u2019ve all been there. There\u2019s a blizzard raging outside and as you step out of the car to head to the house, you\u2019ve got a good 30 seconds to check your phone to see if you have any likes in the 10 seconds since the last time you checked your phone. However, if you take your gloves off, your hands will be cold. What to do? I absolutely MUST check Instagram?!?!\nWell good news, Mujjo has a series of Touchscreen Gloves that will let you check all the things without having to freeze your hands off. They sent me a pair of their Single Layered and Leather Crochet Touchscreen Gloves to check out and thankfully, Atlanta had a few snow days this winter so I really got to test these bad boys out. \nInstead of crafting two separate reviews for both pairs of gloves, I\u2019m going to do them both here and let you pick your favorite.Single Layered Gloves\nI\u2019ll just say it - these are probably the nicest, lightweight, touchscreen gloves that I\u2019ve used. I have tried a couple other cheap gloves from Amazon and these are no comparison. They\u2019re just better, hands-down. Tee hee. Design\nThese are the most lightweight of all the gloves that Mujjo makes and are perfect for days or climates that get chilly, but not down-right freezing. They fit snugly on your fingers without cutting off circulation. The knitted fabric keeps the elements out, while a thin layer of fleece keeps your hands warm. There seems to be a small amount of elastic in the wrist which helps to keep the gloves securely on your wrist without allowing the elements in either. The gloves are secured with a leather strap and a magnetic snap button that adds another level of quality to them. Like I said, they\u2019re nice.\nMujjo also claims that they use a new improved yarn that is stronger and less prone to pilling which is certainly helpful. I have not used their previous generation of gloves so I can\u2019t compare it to what they had before, but I can say with confidence that these will be more durable than my cheap Amazon pair. Lastly, there are small silicon dots placed on the fingers and palm that provide grip for your phone so it doesn\u2019t go flying out of your hand as you try to take it out of your pocket. That would suck...believe me. Function\nNow, the more important part, will they actually let me to constantly Tweet my 23 followers without having to take my gloves off?? In short, yes! In Mujjo\u2019s words, these gloves were designed to allow \u201cUnrestricted Usage\u201d and I would say that is mostly true. What they mean by that is that you are not limited to being able to use just a couple of fingers to touch the screen. These gloves are designed to allow you to use any of your fingers, knuckles, palm, or even heel of your hand to touch your screen. I tested this claim as best I could and it works. Now keep in mind - touching your phone with the heel of you hand is going to be much less accurate than using your fingers - go figure. \nNow for those that don\u2019t know, the screen on your phone works by sensing the conductive properties of your skin. That\u2019s why normal gloves don\u2019t really work with touchscreens. To fix that problem, Mujjo knitted high-quality silver-coated nylon fibers into the fabric, thus making the gloves conductive when coming in contact with your skin thereby allowing you to use your phone while wearing their gloves. Magic!\nIt actually does work, a little better than I was expecting to be honest. I\u2019ve included a short video below that should help give you some idea of just how much functionality you\u2019ll have and as long as you have a little patience, you should be able to do almost anything you need to, even text.  Leather Crochet Touchscreen Gloves\nOk, the reason I called the Single Layer Gloves the nicest lightweight ones that I\u2019ve used is because the Leather Crochet ones are the nicest I\u2019ve used, period. These gloves will definitely class you up quite a bit, which is really saying something for some of us out there!Design\nStylish is kind of an understatement when describing these gloves. The unique combination of leather and crocheted cotton is really cool. I\u2019m not a fashionista by any stretch of the imagination, but I think they\u2019re cool. And that\u2019s all that matters! \nThe palm is covered with Ethiopian lambskin which, according to the company, is known for providing the best insulation out of all the types of leather. Who knew? Atop the leather is Egyption cotton which of course is high quality...cuz I\u2019m a cotton expert. But seriously, how could Egyption cotton not be high quality? The same great leather strap and magnetic clasp from the Single Layered gloves make their way to these guys to round out the show.\nNot only are these gloves super stylish, but they\u2019re incredibly comfortable as well! You can thank cashmere lining for that. My hands never got cold while wearing them. I took them with me to Boston for a week or so and the weather never got above 20 degrees while I was there and my hands never once got even a little chilly. Function\nSince these gloves have leather instead of cotton touching you plam, Mujjo had to come up with another way to allow you to touch your touchscreen. All they really say about that is \u201cnanotechnology\u201d (cuz aliens) but it still works. Mujjo also says that this nanotechnology works independently of your skin which allows them to put the cashmere lining inside without affecting functionality. Sure, we\u2019ll go with that. \nAs far as functionality, I will say that it works much better than I thought it would. Being that these are significantly thicker than the Single Layer gloves, there is much less freedom of movement in the fingers so while you can use your phone, it may take you a few more touches to do things. You will have to be much more deliberate with your touches while wearing these. For simple things like answering of declining calls and maybe taking pictures, these will be fine. For anything more delicate such as updating social media or definitely typing in text, it will be more challenging. Again, I\u2019ve included a short video below to give you some idea, but don\u2019t take the video as final word. They are much easier to use than what I was able to get on video. One Last Thing\nThere is one thing I need to point out with the Leather Gloves. The Crochet pattern on the back tends to catch on stuff and come apart far easier than I would like. Within just a few short weeks of use, I had runaway threads sticking out all over the gloves. Your mileage may vary, but it was kind of annoying to see such nice gloves quickly develop such an issue. So What\u2019s the Verdict?\nBuy them! Right now! Do it! I\u2019ll make it easy for you. They have 6 different types of gloves to choose from depending on your geography and circumstances. \nThese gloves are definitely worth getting if you\u2019re in a place that calls for them, or if you travel frequently to one. If you are in South Florida and don\u2019t get out much (Modern Dad) then I would probably not recommend picking these up. If, however you live in Canada (or really any cold, snowy climate) then you can\u2019t go wrong! These gloves will certainly make the winter months a bit more bearable.

However, when it comes to phone cases, sometimes two really is better than one, and that\u2019s the case with well\u2026 the case. What case is it you might ask? Well, it\u2019s the DualPro by Incipio. Incipio has been making the DualPro case for quite some time and it\u2019s one of their more popular series of cases. I have to admit that I happen to be a big fan of them. I started using the DualPro series case a while ago, and I loved the version for my BlackBerry KeyONE. In fact, I loved it so much that I decided to get one to review and use for my fancy new BlackBerry Motion.The Look: The look of the case is the timeless, integrated two-case system that provides tons of protection for your phone. It has a soft inner case that wraps around your phone and keeps it safe and warm, and then a secondary shell that\u2019s made of hard plastic that helps add impact resistance and drop protection. The case does have seams, but it appears to be as almost seamless - for real; it looks and feels like a one-piece. There are several other two-piece case systems that I have used in the past, and many of them have a hard time sealing up properly and melding together; not so with the DualPro. The DualPro clicks into place and is comfortably snug, but oh so elegant. The version that I got is the Black on Black case, and it looks fantastic. The DualPro also comes in Iridescent Midnight Blue, which also ooks fantastic. The Feel: The case has a very unique feeling to it. In addition to being ultra protective, the patented Plextonium that forms the outer shell is svelte, and almost has a soft-to-the-touch feel. It\u2019s not slick, but your finger glides over it with ease. In addition to having a unique, comfortable texture, it\u2019s also not prone to scratches \u2013 at least they aren\u2019t readily visible. The overall feel of the case is nice and it feels sturdy, yet form-fitting. Usually protective style cases are pretty bulky, but the DualPro has a really solid feel to it that I like, and just feels right when it\u2019s on the phone. The buttons are nice and responsive, with a comfortable tactile feel. Last but not least, the cut-out for the USB-C port is great and gives you easy access to charge your phone.Security: Security is where the DualPro shines. It may be fancy and feel great, but it also has 10ft of drop protection \u2013 holy smokes. You can drop this thing from the same height as a basketball goal rim and it will still be ok \u2013 according to them. I\u2019m not crazy enough to drop my phone 10ft. However, 10ft is easily above what many other cases in this price range and heft have to offer. The case has a shock absorbing inner core that keeps your phone safe when it counts and keeps you focused on more important things like living your life and enjoying your phone in a variety of situations. Conclusion: The Incipio DualPro is a great case that gives you flexibility with day-to-day life, when you otherwise might have to compromise on style or appearance to gain some added protection. However, with the DualPro, you can take what life throws at you and keep on keeping on. The aesthetics and form factor are excellent, it feels great and it has more protection than you can shake a stick at. Pros:\n-\tIt looks great and really molds to the phone. Aesthetics are solid,\n-\tThe Black and Blue colors really make the phone stand out.\n-\tSecurity is top-notch! 10ft of drop protection is crazy.Cons:\n-\tDoesn\u2019t come in more colors \u2013 two is nice, but three or four could be better\n-\tIt\u2019s not the cheapest case in the world ($29.99), but it\u2019s well-priced\n-\tBecause of the rounded top of the Motion the top case seal looks a little odd. \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one of Incipio\u2019s DualPro cases for your BlackBerry Motion, you can check them out on http://www.incipio.com \u2013 they are currently priced at $29.99.

The great thing about all of the colors is that they all look fantastic, so you really can\u2019t go wrong.\nOn the eve of the greatest annual phone release in the android world, Incipio has risen to the occasion once again and already has a lineup of cases ready to go for game day. If you\u2019re new to the phone accessory world, Incipio has been around the block more than a few times, and they always manage to deliver a solid assortment of gear. I was pleasantly surprised to see that not only one, but two iterations of the Esquire series case made the cut, and the Octane was also revved up and ready to go for launch day. Speaking of launch day, let\u2019s see the launch day harvest spread of what Incipio has to offer.\nCarnaby Esquire Series: They\u2019re sleek, they\u2019re stylish, and they elevate your phone game to the next level. Whether you\u2019re making objections in the court room or placing your phone on the table during a board meeting, the Esquire series will keep your phone safe, and looking good at the same time. While they aren\u2019t MIL-STD rated for drop protection, they\u2019re definitely no slouch. I\u2019ve used them on just about every device I\u2019ve had in the last two to three years, and I keep coming back for more. The tightly woven fibers are made from high quality nylon, and the quality control on these guys is best-in-class, at least in my opinion. You won\u2019t find much out in the accessory world better than these guys, unless you\u2019re reaching up into the next echelon of style and wrapping your phone in leather. This generation comes in the classic Black and Blue colors that we\u2019ve seen in past generations. You can pick one up right now on Incipio.com for $34.99.Esquire Series Folio Edition: I like to call this case the Esquire Part Deux. If you\u2019re interested in keeping it fancy, yet flexible, check out the Folio design. Not only does it offer the same features and fantastic looks of the base Esquire series case, it also offers the folio cover, which also works as a stand for your phone. This model works great for professional, as well as personal settings. Tired of holding your phone while you skim through work documents or watching Netflix? No worries, rotate the stand and toss this baby up on the desk. Not only is it convenient, but it\u2019s stylish. In addition to doubling as a stand, the inside of the folio also allows you to carry two cards with you. If you work in the business/professional world and routinely have to wear a suit and tie, the added flexibility of being able to through your cards in the case and ditch the wallet is a luxury. Interested yet? The folio edition is only available in Gray, and you currently going for $49.99. It\u2019s a bit of a price jump, but the flexibility and added options are definitely worth consideration.Octane Series: The Octane series is a high-performance case that looks down-right sexy. Available in four different colors: Black, Electric Pink, Frost, and two-tone Galactic Green/Gray. The case is made out of Incipio\u2019s trademarked Plextonium material, and also incorporates a polycarbonate material into the shell case for added strength. The ridges on the bumpers help with added grip, and the protective cushion built into the bumpers helps seal the deal on protection, ringing in at 6ft of MIL-STD rated drop protection. I have used the Octane series cases before on a few different devices of mine, and they\u2019re a great go-to option for both style, and protection. The added grip and protection allow you to enjoy life on the go without having to worry about damaging your phone, and the subdued styling helps to keep scratches at bay. All in all, it\u2019s a solid case that offers various options for style, and it won\u2019t break the bank. You can pick one up on Incipio.com for $24.99.\nInterested in picking one up or have questions about the new Incipio case lineup? Sound off in the comments.

If your answer is \u201ceverything I own!\u201d then SCOTTeVEST is definitely something for you.\nSCOTTeVEST is a clothing company that takes a little different approach to pockets. They\u2019re obsessed with them. They love them so much that they put them on everything. It\u2019s like Frank\u2019s hot sauce. They even put pockets on their underwear. No joke.\nFor these guys bags are overrated and so early 2000s. The cool kids don\u2019t carry bags any more. Any why should you when you can comfortably carry quite literally everything you would need right in your jacket? Or vest? Or hoodie? Or underwear? Or even in your lab coat? Seriously\u2026they make a lab coat.\nSo now for the big question...does it work? Can you really fit more than any one person could ever possibly carry at one time into one of these jackets? I\u2019m glad you asked.Soft-wear\nSo this is their Hoodie Cotton and that\u2019s exactly what it is, which means is super comfy, super warm and just makes you wanna snuggle. Even with all the zippers and pockets, it\u2019s still very comfortable to wear if you\u2019re a hoodie kinda guy or gal. As the name suggests, it\u2019s made out of cotton and it feels fantastic. And since it\u2019s made out of cotton it's premium level comfortable and is also amazing in colder weather You wouldn\u2019t think living in Atlanta it would get super cold, but this winter has been nuts. Like crazy nuts. I\u2019ve really gotten to test this guy out and it passes. Keep in mind that cotton may start to cook ya a bit in warmer weather due to it not being the most breathable fabric.\nMy absolutely favorite design feature of this guy, aside from the ridiculous number of pockets, is actually built right into the hood. It\u2019s a little drop down eye mask sewn into the front of the hood that you can drop down when napping to help you sleep a bit better. And the help all those random strangers and pesky family members get the picture, there\u2019s a not-so-subtle \u201cDO NOT DISTURB\u201d printed on it. How has no one thought of this before?!?!?! Like seriously world, that\u2019s just common sense. \nLastly, I know it\u2019ll seem weird to some people, but I really like the thumb holes cut into the end of the sleeves - they're actually more like cool ninja sleeves. It may not be the coolest feature, but as a 90s kid, it\u2019s wonderfully nostalgic and helps feed that awkward 12-year old kid that I once knew and loved. It also actually keeps your hands warm too so it earns it\u2019s spot on the hoodie. Hard-wear\n21. What comes to mind when you think about that number? Black Jack? That crazy birthday in college that you may or may not remember? Well you should have been thinking, \u201cthe number of pockets I wish I had in my jackets.\u201d That\u2019s what I was thinking. That\u2019s what all the cool kids were thinking. And it\u2019s precisely the number of pockets on the SeV Hoodie Cotton. Twenty-one. Let that number sink in. Most backpacks don\u2019t have that many pockets, which I guess is kind of the point. Anway, moving on. \nLet\u2019s start with the two pockets typically on a hoodie, or at least what you thought was just two pockets. SCOTTeVEST is anything but typical so they turned these two pockets into nine. Nine pockets. How is this possible?? I honestly don\u2019t know! It\u2019s kind of insane that they are able to turn what you thought was just two pockets into nine. These will hold so much more than just your hands, although they are great hand holders - it's perfect if you don't know what to buy yourself for Valentine's Day! \nNow, back to the two pockets that you would expect to have in which you typically rest your hands (1 & 2). Both of these are dissected by the lining of two additional pockets accessible via zippers from the top of these two hand pockets (3 & 4); ba-da-boom-ba-da-bing, now you\u2019ve got four pockets (5 & 6). If you reach into the left side hand pocket, you\u2019ll find a small velcro pocket for keeping your loose change around (7). However, if you\u2019re one of those extra cautious types and doesn\u2019t like carrying all your spare change in just one semi-secret coin pocket, no worries! Tucked away in the two front zipper pockets are two more such semi-secret velcro coin pockets (8 & 9). Ok, those are all the pockets on the outside of the hoodie, at least I think they are. I\u2019m sure one or two more will magically appear at some point!\nOne last thing to note is that in the right side hand pocket, there is an elastic \u201ckey-keeper\u201d band secured with a snap button. This technically doesn\u2019t qualify as a pocket, but it\u2019s certainly a cool feature to prevent any wander hands from wandering off with your keys. SCOTTeVEST designs their stuff with travelers and business folks in mind so keeping your stuff secure is priority for them.\nLet\u2019s move inside shall we? Both sides are actually laid out the same way so I\u2019ll just cover it all in one pass. Starting at the bottom, the first pockets you\u2019ll come to are small, what I\u2019ll call \u201chalf-pockets\u201d (10 & 11). These are rectangular pockets that are perfect for holding similarly shaped objects. The left one is recommended for holding a notepad (for those nostalgic folks who still write stuff down...weirdos). This half-pocket on the right side is really interesting, and especially cool for me. I love sunglasses and may or not have more pairs than my girlfriend has shoes. This right-hand half-pocket is actually designed to hold sunglasses. You can tell they designed it this way because they secured a microfiber cleaning cloth onto an elastic band inside this pocket. Yeah, no joke. There\u2019s a pocket layout printed on it to help navigate your way through the jacket and it\u2019s also just cool seeing them catering to those of us with sunglass addiction...it\u2019s a thing. \nAbove these dope half-pockets are two Pad Pockets (12 & 13). What are they called Pad Pockets you ask? Well why do you think? Cuz you can fit an iPad in them! Go figure! That\u2019s right, the full size (not the super size 12.9\u201d) 9.7\u201d iPad and similarly sized tablets will fit in either of these pockets! That\u2019s just awesome. Backpack who?? Full disclosure, I do not own a 10.1\u201d iPad Pro so I was unable to test that one, but the two devices are so close in size that I would be surprised if it didn\u2019t fit. \nMoving on up, above the Pad Pockets, you\u2019ve got two phone pockets (14 & 15, they just don\u2019t stop!). These guys are large enough to fit pretty much every phone on the planet. Basically, if it won\u2019t fit in this pocket, it\u2019s not a phone, it\u2019s a tablet. In true SCOTTeVEST style though, both pockets have a mesh front that allow you use the touch screen while pocketed. I\u2019m not quite sure how much use you\u2019ll get by being able to touch your phone through your pocket, but I guess it\u2019s convenient for dismissing phone calls, or other simple tasks. \nNow there is a small seam inside both of these pockets which, according to SCOTTeVEST, technically provides two more pockets in this guy (this would be 16 & 17). I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re officially \u201cpockets\u201d, but they do work pretty well for storing a charging cable or charging brick so they\u2019re still helpful. Just to the right of the phone pockets, right up against the zipper, are two pen pockets. These are for...pens (18 & 19). Go figure. \nLast, but certainly not least, although quite possibly the smallest, are two BudBucket Pockets (don\u2019t ask, I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re called that either). These are about the size of a USB thumb drive which I guess is what they\u2019re intended for. You might be able to fit one or two other things in there, like maybe half of a pencil, but other than that you probably won\u2019t get much use out of them. SCOTTeVEST recommends using them for Bluetooth earbuds which will work, but depending on the size of yours, it may be a small hassle to get them out of the pocket easily. (20 & 21). \nAs proof of SCOTTeVEST\u2019s commitment to quality, each jacket design is inspected by a licensed chiropractor to ensure that all the added weight will not adversely affect your spinal cord. To accomplish this, the company devised a unique placement of the seams to allow for as much even weight distribution as possible. Now, if you add 10 pounds of gear, you are still going to be carrying an extra 10 pounds of gear, but distributing the weight evenly across your chest, shoulders, and back is a very welcome feature. \nOne last, very cool feature of this hoodie is called the Personal Area Network (PAN). This patented system is a network of small holes and elastic bands strategically placed throughout the hoodie to enable you to keep your headphone cable secure and out of the way. The PAN allows you to run your headphones into almost any pocket on the hoodie, as long as it\u2019s on the inside. So if your phone doesn\u2019t like to discriminate against the other pockets inside your hoodie then you\u2019re good to go! It\u2019s the ultimate in headphone cable management. Who doesn\u2019t love cable management?Show Me the Money\u2026\nYeah, you didn\u2019t think they were just gonna give away all these pockets and features for free did you? The Hoodie Cotton clocks in at $95 before tax which is actually on the cheaper end for their products. There are a few shirts, and some underwear that is cheaper and you can occasionally find some discounts on Amazon and the like, but it\u2019s still gonna cost you.\nHowever, it\u2019s not all bad. Considering that this thing is designed to essentially be an extra carry on bag or day bag replacement, the cost may not be as bad as it sounds. Most decent backpacks are gonna run you at least $60 or more, so this may be a worthy investment.So, is it Worth It?\nUp to you. The SeV Hoodie Cotton is a fantastic piece of clothing. It\u2019s super comfortable, it\u2019s fashionable, or at least as fashionable as a solid color hoodie can be, and it\u2019s got an insane amount of carrying capacity. If you\u2019re a frequent business traveler, or if you hate carrying a bag, then absolutely buy this...right now\u2026 here\u2019s the link. \nIf being able to carry every device you have even possibly owned in your jacket is not that important to you, then maybe you don\u2019t need this. There are definitely plenty of other comfortable hoodies with the normal amount of pockets. Just think about how much you really need 21 pockets. \nI love my hoodie. I\u2019m gonna keep it and have no problem recommending it. You can get yours from their website right here in Black, Cobalt, Ash, Maroon, or Navy. Go ahead. Get one. I dare you.", "time": "02-25-2018 09:26 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Incipio Carnaby Esquire Series Preview/Review", "thread": [{"postID": "post6172161", "text": "Ever dream of a chance at the sweet life? Have you wondered what it\u2019s like to hang your hat on the bar ledge and sip delicious, carefully aged scotch while you talk about the stock market and make cheeky political jokes with your pals? Me too\u2026 for sure. Sounds great! This case may not quite do that, but it will make you feel pretty cool when you slide it out on the bar while you relax with a nice refreshing micro-brew. Welcome to the Incipio Carnaby, Esquire series \u2013 the case that dreams, not lawsuits, are made of. \nThe Esquire series case is a fancy little number that the dreamers and creators at Incipio have crafted up, like the sweet ambrosia of the mobile industry, and sent down for us phone toters to raise a glass, and raise our phone status, with a sweet, sweet case. This is my review refresh for the Pixel 2 with new colors, as well as showcasing the fancy new color options and selections for the iPhone X, and the BlackBerry Motion.The Look: If you can\u2019t tell, I am rather smitten with this case; so smitten in fact that I currently have it for the iPhone X, Pixel 2, and BlackBerry Motion \u2013 see the group photo! The design, the aesthetics and the classy woven fabric on the back of the phone just exudes class. Pound-for-pound, this is my go-to, most favorite case ever that isn\u2019t leather. It\u2019s different, and it\u2019s sleek, that\u2019s for sure. If you want a case that compliments your suit and tie, you've come to the right place. If you don't wear a suit, no worries; you don't even need one. This case looks good no matter what you're wearing! Sure, there are many fancy leather cases out there to compete with \u2013 I\u2019ve used some \u2013 but this is just on a different level in my book. I have been toting around this case as my daily driver since I took it out of the box, and it really makes me not want to get another case. Sure, there are many fancy leather cases out there \u2013 I\u2019ve used some \u2013 but this is just on a different level in my book. I have been toting around this case as my daily driver since I took it out of the box, and it really makes me not want to get another case. \niPhone X: \nPixel 2:\nBlackBerry Motion:The Feel: The woven cotton material surrounding the case is fantastic. It feels a little slick when you first take it out of the box, but as you use it that feeling quickly goes away. It\u2019s not overly grippy of course, but it\u2019s got a very good texture and feel to it that you won\u2019t find in a normal case. In fact, I even miss the case whenever I\u2019m switching back and forth between my other devices and am stuck using a rubberized/plastic case. The buttons on this case work well and the cutouts are very precise. The buttons aren\u2019t oversized, and they have a nice little click sound that they make when you press them. Another nice thing about this case is that it doesn\u2019t dig into your fingers while you\u2019re holding it. This is the biggest case pet-peeve of mine (you know this is you\u2019ve read some of my other reviews). When I\u2019m holding my phone, especially when lounging in the recliner or laying in bed, my pinky finger cradles the bottom of the phone for support, and it\u2019s so frustrating when you have a case that digs into your finger; well, it\u2019s not a problem with this one! Security: The protection on this phone is also pretty darn good. Definitely be careful if you are looking to set it down on any surface that could potentially be wet. It\u2019s water resistant, but it\u2019s not water proof. The case material is made out of woven cotton, so it can absorb liquids and other oils that a normal case would not, so be careful where you put down your phone. The case does have the protective lip that creates a buffer between the phone screen and a flat surface, which is fairly standard with Incipio cases \u2013 extra points here for me. The case itself rated for 3ft of drop protection, which is super ample for the design. Again, it has protective properties, but this is the kind of case that you\u2019re going to wear in a business or professional environment, not riding around in your Jeep or taking snowboarding. It\u2019s very good at keeping your safe from most any normal danger or chance occurrence you might encounter.\nConclusion: I love it, and I think you\u2019ll love it too. It may not be for everyone or suit your individual lifestyle, but I can recommend this case for just about anyone, especially if you like to change your phone case often, or for special occasions. It\u2019s sleek, it\u2019s suave, and it looks great when you\u2019re wearing a suit or business-professional attire. You definitely can\u2019t go wrong with this case unless you\u2019re a scuba instructor or a deckhand on a ship.Pros: \n-\tLooks really sharp!\n-\tPairs well with professional attire and really impresses \n-\tQuality build materials and the cotton fiber is really nice\n-\tDurable, and well-priced\n-\tThe cotton fibers are tight and have withstood the test of time!Cons: \n-\tCan\u2019t take it scuba diving\n-\tCotton fibers can pick up stains if you aren\u2019t careful\n-\tNot suitable for alpine skiing or boating in the french riveriaFollow-Up Thoughts: I\u2019ve never done a re-tread on a phone case before, so this is definitely new to me. However, after coming back to the same phone case so many times\u2026 (S8+, Note8, Pixel 2, iPhone X, and the BlackBerry Motion), I can say definitively that this is my go-to case. It\u2019s well-made (see if you can spot the drop marks on my BlackBerry Motion pictures), it\u2019s sleek and it just screams class! I get compliments on these cases regularly, and it just feels nice to carry. It has a great blend of style and looks pricey, but the price is balanced and it\u2019s a comfortable case to carry in any setting. I cannot recommend this case enough for any phone that you happen to be using. 10/10 recommend the Carnaby! \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one of these sweet cases, you can find them over at Incipio\u2019s website: http://www.incipio.com \u2013 the price for each phone model is $34.99.

It was an Acer with a 10\" screen. I used it downstairs as an Internet appliance. Worked great. Loved it.\nWhen my PC finally died, I decided to wean myself away from Microsoft. I have retired and did not think I needed the type of horsepower that came with the PC and the MS Office Suite.\nHowever, I had a really nice Samsung monitor and while I knew I could get a bigger and better Chromebook, a Google Rep at a local Best Buy told me I should get a Chromebox. I said great, I can keep my monitor and use a Chromebox. He said Best Buy does not carry them but Amazon does.\nFound the Chromebox M004U with an upgrade to a 4 gb ram card. Paid the $200.00 and was thrilled to see the box, with the Asus security tape intact, at my door. Plugged it it, turned it on and I was thrilled.\nEight months later I noticed my external speaker had an annoying hum. Attached that speaker to my Chromebook, no hum. Attached a different speaker to my Chromebox, it began to hum.\nCalled Asus and they told me to ship it to them as it was in the warranty period. They sent me an email telling me the 4 gb ram was not a genuine Asus part thereby voiding the warranty. I could pay them $100.00 to fix it.\nNope, send it back. Contacted Amazon seller and asked for my money back because they sold me a \"new\" Chromebox with a 4gb upgrade. They never responded.\nBack to Asus and showed them a photo of the label at the bottom of the box. It said it was a new Chromebox. They said the reseller changed the ram and did not use a genuine Asus part thereby voiding the warranty.\nAsus then told me, while they allow their resellers to make such upgrades, they have no policy that requires genuine Asus parts to be used. Naturally, that voids the warranty. \nSince the product arrived with Asus secuirty tape intact, then the only people that benifit from this is Asus. I yelled fraud.\nAfter I contacted my local consumer protection office, Asus got back to me and said they would repair my Chromebox at no charge. They would also provide free shipping. I got back the repaired Chromebox. Asus replaced a faulty audio port and installed a SSD 16Gb drive. They did not change the ram card.\nBut here is my problem. How do I trust a company that knows their policy will void a warranty? Asus delivers a sealed box with a 2gb ram card to the reseller, the reseller cuts the security tape, swaps out the ram for a 4gb card, seals the box with security box and sends it to me. As the consumer, I think I've got a brand new factory sealed product.\nSo, be careful when you buy an Asus product, the fact it has the Asus security tape affixed, does not guarantee it has a warranty.\nAnyone want to buy a recently repaired Chromebox?

Regardless of the time period or setting, it still holds true. In this case, BLU\u2019s day has arrived, on the polished and fantastic powerhouse coattails of the VIVO X. The X moniker was introduced by the iPhone, and rumored for the upcoming Samsung, but today, it\u2019s here for the VIVO; and I happen to think it\u2019s quite fitting. The previous BLU flagship device, the VIVO 8, was good, but in retrospect it really didn\u2019t go far enough to separate itself from its own device lineups IMHO (in my honest opinion). However, all has changed and the mold has been smashed with the VIVO X!Pricing: The MSRP is $299, which is a steal of a deal for what the VIVO X brings to the table. Even more enticing is the limited time sale price of $199 (an amazing discount!), exclusively through Amazon. The VIVO X only comes in one color, which is Black. Specs:\n- An Octa-core MediaTek P25 Helio processor (and Mali GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 2.6ghz\n- 4GB of memory \n- a 6.0\u201d curved glass display made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 \n- HD+ Resolution (1440x720p) with an 18:9 wide screen viewing experience (268ppi)\n- A 4,000 mAh battery\n- 64GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n- A 13MP main camera with Sony IMX Processor & 5MP secondary shooter w/LED flash\n- A 20MP front-facing cameras and 8MP secondary selfie-shooter, with LED flash.\n- Runs Android 7.0 Nougat\n- Bonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)Overview and Performance: \nFirst and foremost, I want to say that this phone is a beast, which is an unprecedented jump in power, functionality and performance that I have not seen to-date, in a BLU phone. As I eluded to above, the VIVO 8 was a solid phone, but it just didn\u2019t jump out at me as a \u201cflagship\u201d device. Many of the specs and accents were there, but it just didn\u2019t have that \u201cflagship\u201d zip and wow factor; that all changes today with the VIVO X. When I first got the email on this device, I had to do a double-take because I didn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. Octa-core 2.6ghz processor, 4.000mAh battery, 6\u201d screen, and 4 cameras! If I said that out loud to a group of people, nobody would expect the follow up sentence to be \u201call of this is in the new BLU phone.\u201d So, without further ado, let\u2019s talk about it. Off the bat, the processor is phenomenal. I\u2019m not going to run out and buy a MediaTek t-shirt anytime soon, but the power and speed in the new Helio P25 processor is definitely noteworthy, and carries a level of production that I wouldn\u2019t have expected out of a MediaTek chip; job well done, MediaTek. The cameras are an absolute delight \u2013 which you can probably tell from my review video, which I spent a good bit of time showcasing the camera. The interface is on-point, the shutter speed is great and the capabilities are equally impressive. This is the BLU phone that finally earned a seat at the table of many of its esteemed colleagues, and has a couple of bragging points to drop on the table.Display: The screen size on this baby is a whopping 6\u201d, with an 80% screen to body ratio, a PPI of 268, and an eye-catching modified 2k resolution of 1440x720p, which they refer to as HD+. The dynamic is a bit curious, but they were able to squeeze it all into an 18:9 aspect ratio, which is the backbone of the elongated aspect ratio. The main benefit to the modified resolution is that it ties in high-definition resolution with stellar power management - the scaled down hi-res display consumes less power and allows the phone to crank out the graphics. The screen is made out of Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which is still my favorite iteration to-date. It\u2019s solid, scratch resistant, and works really well. All in all, the screen balance is great, and you can adjust the color temperature settings to your own individual preference. I think that BLU really hit a home run in creativity and design with this phone, and the screen really helps to showcase the effort that went into making such a great phone.Battery Life: I should have entitled this section \u201cbattery life for days\u201d, but I think that\u2019s mostly fitting with all BLU devices. If anyone were to try to say what niche that BLU has tapped into with their devices, it\u2019s battery power, and the VIVO X is no different. The VIVO X is sporting a massive 4,000mAh battery, which will last you well into day two, with moderate use. One of the great things that really helps to stretch the battery life out is the modified HD+ resolution. Typically, a 6\u201d screen with a 2k/4k phone resolution is going to burn through battery life because of the display size and amount of rendering that is required, but with the 2k/720p screen resolution combination, it helps to keep the power demands down, all while opening up the throttle on the processor to do things other than produce super high-res video that really, many people can\u2019t tell the difference anyway. The human eye cannot even tell a difference between 2k and 1080p until you get over the 5.3\u201d hurdle, so a 6\u201d screen at a modified 2k resolution still looks great. To put a modified resolution on context, the iPhone 8 only has a 750x1334 resolution, and it still looks good too.Fingerprint Sensor: While the FPS functionality of a phone may not be that important to a lot of people, I tend to think of it more as a \u201csleeper\u201d spec. It\u2019s not something that you really pay too much attention to at first glance, but it is something that can start to wear on your over time. Well, the VIVO X definitely won\u2019t be causing you any headache. I have tested a lot of fingerprint sensors throughout my time doing reviews, and I\u2019ve certainly reviewed a lot of BLU phones and I can tell you with absolute certainty that this is the best FPS BLU has ever used, and it\u2019s one of the fastest I\u2019ve ever used before. The fastest I believe is the Pixel 2, but the VIVO X is tied with the BlackBerry KeyONE, in my opinion. It\u2019s fast, and it works in a jiffy. I was very impressed with it, and I\u2019m sure you will be too.Sound: The sound is arguably the best that BLU has produced in a phone before. The VIVO 8 did do a really good job with its dual downward firing speakers, but the VIVO X gives it a run for its money, especially for a mono-speaker configuration. The speaker is much the same as the latest Samsung devices, with the speaker installed on the bottom-right side of the phone. It works and it produces solid sound. The only hang-up I have is that like most phones with speakers installed in this position, it\u2019s very easy to slide your hand over the speaker and muffle the sound. Other than that mild complaint, the speaker compliments the phone really well. Volume and clarity are top-notch for BLU, and of course, I\u2019m happy to report that BLU went ahead and threw in the 3.5mm headphone jack (score!)Camera: And now for something completely different\u2026 This phone has four cameras! Not two, not three, but four (4) cameras! So what does as phone with four cameras do exactly? Well, it takes tons of awesome pictures, and including wide-lens photographs for front-facing selfies, as well as with the rear-mounted primary shooters. The front-facing cameras are 20MP (f2.0 aperture) and 8MP, while the rear-facing cameras are 13MP (also an f2.0 aperture) and 5MP, and each respective pair works in tandem to help you catch some truly creative and epic pictures. The BLU Final Touch software on this device is the best I\u2019ve ever seen, and it shows on both sides of the lens. The coolest feature I think is the wide-lens photo mode, which is built into the camera app. Instead of taking a one-click wide-angle photo, you put it on wide-angle photo mode and hit the shutter button, and then the camera app instructs you to pan the camera to the left and right margins to envelop the whole viewing angle, which creates the wide-angle photo; it\u2019s really quite novel! In addition to the new wide-angle picture feature, the video recording department upped its game as well and incorporated a slow-mo video recording mode, which is fun to play with. Finally, making another appearance in the Final Touch software are all of the cool filter options and the \"beauty mode\" that allows you to fancy up your pictures for social media. All in all, the software suite is technical enough to create some high-class photographs without requiring technical expertise or difficult maneuvering to pull off. Simply put, the cameras are very capable, take great pictures and help even the most novice of photographers take some fantastic shots!Software: The VIVO X is running Android 7.0 Nougat, straight out of the box. This wasn\u2019t very surprising since all of BLU\u2019s new phones in the past 6 months or so have launched with Nougat. I do wish that they have went ahead and upped their game and launched the X with Oreo, but when you\u2019re living in a sub-$300 world, it\u2019s a nicety and not really an expectation. The version of Nougat the comes on the VIVO X is near-stock and very clean. For reasons unknown to me, BLU keeps bouncing back and forth with the UI features and locations of the quick-settings and notification menu. The VIVO X switched back to the same interface as the VIVO 8 and has the notifications drop-down on the top, and a swipe-up from the bottom pulls up the quick-settings menu. It works just fine and isn\u2019t an issue, but I\u2019d really like to see some consistency moving further into the year. The Google Assistant is just a right-swipe away, and is still a great addition to the OS. All in all, it runs smooth and isn\u2019t cluttered up with bloatware and other stuff, which has been a great step in the right direction for BLU throughout the past year. They have cut back on software suites and third-party apps, and really whittled everything down to a very near-stock experience, which I think is great!Conclusion: All in all, I thoroughly enjoy using the VIVO X, and it gets a very solid recommendation from me. The VIVO X is a massive powerhouse in the budget-tier sector, and even reaches up past many mid-tier offers from many other manufacturers. As I said in the beginning, this is a real breakout device for BLU and I really raises the bar for what we should expect from the VIVO flagship series in the future. This is not an incremental upgrade; it\u2019s a huge step forward for BLU and their VIVO series of devices. \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a VIVO X device, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 21 January, 2018, with exclusive pricing on Amazon while supplies last. The normal price is going to be $299, but during the sale, they are discounting it by $100, for a grant total of $199, which is one heck of a deal for what this phone brings to the table.

My very first model was the BlackBerry 7100G. I had wanted a BlackBerry from the very first time I saw one, but I couldn\u2019t afford one. By time I got the 7100, I had a pretty good job and was happy to pay Cingular (now AT&T) by hard earned money for this fancy new device and the additional fee for BIS. For the uninitiated, BIS stands for BlackBerry Internet Services, which was required to use mobile data at the time. The 7100 was my first BlackBerry, but it wasn\u2019t my last. Fast forwarding through the years, the next BlackBerry I got was the Pearl, with its slick little trackball (I went through two of these phones because I used it so much that I blew out the trackball and contacts). I ended up skipping on the Bold series, opting for the iPhone because I wanted 3G internet. I patiently waited for the inevitable upgrade that was slow to come, and then finally pounced on the Z10 once BB10 was launched; it was love all over again. I was happy with the Z10, but I missed the physical keyboard so as soon as the Q10 came out, I switched to that. Over time, I owned the Z10, Q10, Z30, Classic, Passport in White, Black, SE model, as well as the ATT version, and finally after BB10\u2019s glory days had begun to fade, I got a BlackBerry Porsche P\u20199982, and P\u20199983. I was even an early adopter of the bug-plagued Priv that I was proud to use, and then my hopes faded as BlackBerry outsourced the hardware division, and shuttered the doors on the BB10 factory. I was disheartened to say the least, and found it difficult to decide where to turn to for my next device. That was until the KeyONE was announced. I was a day-one adopter, pre-ordering the device and driving semi-recklessly down to Best Buy to pick it up on launch day; everything was right with the world again. I had my keyboard, I had the convenience key, and most importantly, I had my BlackBerry back \u2013 minus the screen that fell out of my phone after a few weeks, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. The most important part of this story is that I finally had a real BlackBerry back in my hands. Sure, it isn\u2019t exactly the same, but the nostalgic effect of BlackBerry Mobile and the well-built BlackBerry oriented version of Android made me feel right at home, especially after I enjoyed the Priv so much. The whole experience helped me to believe in BlackBerry again, and helped me to reestablish ties with the brand after everything seemed to spiral down the toilet over time. Enter stage right --- the BlackBerry Motion. \nThe BlackBerry Motion is an important device, because it marks the very first all-touchscreen model made by BlackBerry Mobile. It is as momentous as the release of the Priv, and the KeyONE, which are both unique and novel in their own way. From the first time I picked up the Motion and started using it, it was like the Z10 and Z30 experience all over again, except it felt comfortable and the dimensions finally snapped. I, and many other faithful BlackBerry users has been waiting and waiting for an upgrade to the Z30, and hoped for another true all-touch phone after the Passport and the Priv, but it never came. Well, I\u2019m here today to tell you that it has arrived, and I\u2019m also here to tell you about it.Pricing: The MSRP is $449, which is the best pricing I\u2019ve seen yet on a new BlackBerry, and I think it fits. I was turned off a little bit by the high prices of the Priv and KeyONE on launch, I feel like this price is much more representative of the specs that are in the phone, as well what the device brings to the table.Specs:\n- The timeless Snapdragon 625 clocked @ 2.0ghz (the same processor that powered the KeyONE)\n- 4GB of memory (hallelujah!)\n- a 5.5\u201d curved display, with 1920x1080 HD resolution, made with DragonTrail glass (403ppi)\n- Display is protected by the nano-diamond anti-scratch coating for enhanced protection\n- A 4,000 mAh battery --- awesome battery life\n- 32GB of internal storage (Expandable up to 400gb with an SD card)\n- Rear Camera: 12 MP, f/2.0, phase detection autofocus, dual-LED dual-tone flash\n- Front-Facing Camera 8MP f/2.2 with flash, and supports 1080p video @30fps \n- Runs Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box, complete with BlackBerry software suite and DTEK security\n- Records video at 30FPS for both 4k and 1080p\n- The first BlackBerry ever with IP67 water/dust resistance! \n- GSM unlocked for use with ATT and TMO, and their various MVNOsOverview and Performance: The performance for the BlackBerry Motion is very balanced. The SD625 is not exactly a beast when it comes to straight-line speed, but it\u2019s a very efficient and able-bodied processor that really shines when it comes to multi-tasking, especially when it\u2019s paired with 4gb of RAM, which is a nice addition from the original KeyONE. I very much enjoyed my experience on the KeyONE, but the overall performance was stymied a bit because of the 3gb of RAM. It was eventually corrected in later versions, and I\u2019m happy that it transferred over to the Motion as well. I tried playing some games on the phone and it can get choppy, even on games a few years old like Boom Beach. It\u2019s not enough it unplayable, but it is a bit annoying at times. The overall flow and utility of the user interface, the Productivity Tab and Hub, are unaffected, and work very well. The Hub was a big question mark for me, especially since the last time I really used it was on the Priv, which left me very unimpressed. The Hub finally seems to have the kinks worked out of it and works as it is intended to, and it was a delight to have it back again! In addition to all of this, this is the first ever BlackBerry with IP67 water/dust resistance \u2013 safe for up to 30 minutes in 3ft of water! Display: The display is excellent, at least in my opinion. One of my biggest hang ups with the KeyONE was the screen. It felt white-washed and bland, and was not an enjoyable experience as well. I actually had my expectations set fairly low for the Motion screen, so it was a nice surprise when I fired it up. The color balance is good. It\u2019s not oversaturated, and it\u2019s not bland. It\u2019s a well-balanced color and tone ratio that does a good job for an LCD screen. I wasn\u2019t disappointed, and I don\u2019t think you will be either. Another nicety is the true, full-HD display, rocking a solid 402ppi, and 1920x1080 resolution. Video and graphics are crisp and look good. It\u2019s definitely the best looking screen I\u2019ve used on a BlackBerry, to date.\nBattery Life: The battery life on this phone is spot-on. It\u2019s really hard to beat a 4,000mAh in your phone. On top of the serious battery capacity, the SD625 processor helps take it to the next level. The 625 is a very power efficient processor, and it\u2019s also great for multitasking performance. I was initially hesitant and disappointed when I found out that they were using the same chip for the Motion, but that was until I used it. The experience isn\u2019t watered down at all, and additionally, it\u2019s really about usage. If you\u2019re a gamer and you want to run the latest and greatest games, then this isn\u2019t likely a good fit for you. However, if you\u2019re a traditional BlackBerry user and you love long-lasting performance combined with efficiency, then this will be a good fit. I don\u2019t usually like to test out my phones when it comes to multi-day use because I\u2019m paranoid about being caught out without a charger, but the Motion held up well into day two for me on a single charge. It didn\u2019t make it through two full days because I use my phones heavily, but it made it all the way to lunchtime the next day before I needed to plug it in. Fingerprint Sensor: The fingerprint sensor is good, and if you\u2019ve read my reviews before then you know how much of a fan I am of front-mounted FPS\u2019s. I hate having to reach around the back all the time, especially in instances like the S8/S8+ debacle. One area of disappointment in the Motion is the lack of accuracy. The KeyONE spacebar/FPS hybrid was next-world level good, and I think that set my expectation really high for the Motion. The Motion FPS is good, but it\u2019s not Grrrrreeeaaat (thanks Tony the Tiger). However, it\u2019s not bad\u2026 it\u2019s just not fantastic. It will definitely let you know if your finger placement isn\u2019t in the target zone by vibrating and refusing you unlock. Once you get your finger trained to the FPS placement, it\u2019s perfectly fine. In addition to being a FPS, BlackBerry upped their game and made it a combination home button/notification scroller as well. While touching the home button works as an FPS, pressing down on the button performs the traditional home button function. As for the scrolling function, if you swipe down on the FPS once it pulls down the quick-option screen and notification, and an additional swipe will bring the notifications shade all the way down; how cool!Sound: The sound on the Motion is adequate. It\u2019s not really anything to write home about but it works well for what it is. If you\u2019re a serious sound jockey and really care about power and volume, then this probably won\u2019t be a selling point for you. If you\u2019re interested in good sound that won\u2019t hurt your ears and provides an enjoyable sound experience, I think you\u2019ll be happy with the speaker and sound quality. There is only one speaker on the phone and it\u2019s a downward firing driver on the bottom of the phone. The placement is \u201cok\u201d, but could be better. I find that many times I find myself cupping my hand over the speaker port and muffling the sound, which is not something I\u2019m crazy about. However, it\u2019s mostly the industry standard and the exact same thing you get out of Samsung devices, except it\u2019s slightly better than that. So, marginal placement and adequate sound is the rating that I\u2019ll give for the sound experience.Camera: The camera experience varies from ok, to painful. If the lighting is good, you can catch some decent shots. However, if it\u2019s less-than-optimal lighting conditions, or low-light conditions, your happiness with the quality of the pictures this thing takes will quickly plummet. Additionally, I found that taking pictures of objects with reflective surfaces is not good either. It drastically dims the screen and takes pretty awful pictures. The only thing I can really say here is that they took the business model for phones to the extreme, as-in, it\u2019s a work/productivity phone and isn\u2019t designed around the camera. However, I would caveat that by saying that it should be better, and could have been better. The KeyONE camera was a bragging point for marketing, and I feel like that should have translated over to the Motion as well. I guess it\u2019s one of the sacrificed specs that ended up on the chopping block for the $100 price reduction. On a positive note, the shutter speed is pretty snappy and it takes quick pictures, which is a bonus for me. Additionally, one cool photo feature that the Motion offers is the secure folder. While taking pictures, if you want to send a photo to the secure folder, place your finder on the home button (don't press it), and it will snap a picture and send it directly to your secure folder that requires either a fingerprint or PIN to access. Of course, regular snaps utilizing the shutter button go straight to the photo folder. Software: In today\u2019s society where BlackBerry is now competing on the Android platform, there are some people (myself included), who really have to sit back and wonder, \u201cwhy should I get a BlackBerry?\u201d It\u2019s not BB10 anymore, so why should I shell out the money when I could arguably get something better from another manufacturer? The biggest answer to that question is the software experience. Although the Motion is still running Android 7.1, I have to follow that up by saying that so is the Galaxy S8/8+, so let\u2019s not throw it on the chopping block for that. The BlackBerry UI experience is deeply modified in important ways that takes time to move over to a newer version of Android. The assistant, the Hub, and the DTEK security suite are vital integrations into the OS, and really help secure BlackBerry\u2019s place in the Android world. Sure, there\u2019s something to be said for \u201cstock Android\u201d, but I believe that there is something to be said for modified UI\u2019s, especially when done right; and the Motion does it right. It\u2019s a pleasure to be able to swipe from the left, or the right (depending on your configuration) and open up the Productivity Tab, which features your email, the Hub, notifications and upcoming events on the calendar. The Productivity Tab has come a long way from the Priv, and is chock-full of customizations. You can make the tab larger or smaller, adjust placement on the screen, and even move it from one side of the screen to the other. I dream of a day when a simple swipe from the left will get me straight to the Hub, but for now this is definitely nothing to scoff at. The entire integration of the Productivity Tab into the UI is seamless and works like a charm. Along with the Productivity Tab and the Hub, the DTEK security suite makes a reappearance, as does the BlackBerry Software Suite, which I love. If you swipe over a few screens you can get to a host of BlackBerry gems, like notes, tasks, events, email, composing texts and BBM messages, and even check your data usage and battery level. The best part of the software suite is the BlackBerry touch keyboard, which I argue is the best in the business. If you\u2019re another device, definitely use GBoard, but if you\u2019re rolling with BlackBerry, you never need to look any farther because you\u2019ve already got the best. It is a perfect and seamless translation from BB10, and I have sorely missed it. I love being able to swipe backward on the keyboard to erase, tap the space bar for suggestion and flick up on the selected text predictions that hover over the letters on the keyboard. If you\u2019ve never used a BlackBerry touch keyboard, you\u2019re certainly missing out; it\u2019s a pure delight. \nIf you\u2019re uninitiated to the BlackBerry Hub, then you\u2019re also in for a treat. The Hub is just what the name is, a consolidated, easy-to-use hub that integrates all of your notifications, communications and events into one convenient locale. You can even customize it to prioritize the information/notifications that you want to see. You can even take it one step further and assign a customized color LED notification to the particular notification. For instance, you can make text message notifications Blue, BBM\u2019s can be Yellow, email can be Green, and so on and so forth. The power of the LED and customization is strong with the Motion. Last but not least is the convenience key, which is unique to BlackBerry and configurable to your favorite apps. Although the placement could arguably get better, you get used to it quickly, and then it becomes second-nature. I personally use the convenience key for Slack, which I use all day long, and it\u2019s incredibly neat, and nice, to be able to press the convenience key and pull the app up without a second thought. Software Conclusions? Game. Set. Match, BlackBerry.Conclusion: Overall, the BlackBerry Motion is a fantastic device and the experience is a gem among Androids. Every manufacturer tries to find ways to differentiate themselves from others, and tries to find a way to stand out from the crowd. Oft times though the additional features seem gimmicky, and not appealing at best; not so for BlackBerry. The Hub integration, the convenience key, the fancy front-mounted FPS with the emboldened BlackBerry logo, and so much more, really help create a unique offering that helps power you through the day. Sure, there are hang-ups (most notably the camera), but in the grand scheme of things for $449, I think the overall package and experience really help make this a worthwhile offering, especially if you\u2019re a current BlackBerry user and are looking for the next leap in your device upgrade future. If you\u2019re a BB10 user, past/present, then this is the next best thing, and my hope is that the experience will only get better and better. However, as-is now, the integration and experience are top-notch BlackBerry!\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one of these delightful other-fruit phones, you can find them on Amazon and BestBuy for the everyday price of $449.

Even those who\u2019ve heard of it might just write it off as \u201csome generic Chinese brand\u201d, but like Huawei and Oppo, these are sizable players in mobile overseas without much of a US presence.\nThe Splatter appears to be Coolpad\u2019s second phone to officially reach the US market and is available direct on their website for a penny shy of a $100 USD unlocked. Carrier support appears non-existent so don\u2019t expect to see one in an AT&T store or anywhere else save for secondhand units anytime soon. This is also available on Amazon.com for the original $139 price.WHAT'S IN A NAME?\n\u201cSplatter\u201d is a unique name. (Surprise!) I found it initially evoked a feeling of ruggedness and silliness. The Splatter doesn't appear any more or less rugged than a typical smartphone and hardly feels silly - making it feel somewhat misnamed but it\u2019s a name that's nothing if not memorable.\nI prefer it to the rather hyperbolic Android naming schemes of old, so at least there's that.I\u2019m looking at you, Samsung Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch.CONTEXT\nFor $100, what do you get?\nNot a bad phone! An unlocked one at that as well with decent band support.\nAlso included in the packaging is a microUSB cable and wall adapter rated for a fairly pedestrian output of 5 volts, 1 amp.Coolpad Splatter. The official phone of buying day-old loaves of bread from Jimmy John's for 56 cents.\nAll one had to do to stand out back in 2013 was have decent performance for the price (which was harder to do then than it sounds) and if you hit that perfect list of compromises, the phone basically sold itself as the legend of its value spread. (See the Lumia 520 and Moto G.) Low-end phones as a class have come a long way in the past few years as I said, and for many, they have become capable daily-drivers instead of their original \u201cI-dropped-my-iPhone-in-the-toilet-so-I-have-to-use-this\u201d role.\nAnd this is why the Splatter can exist as it is, be as competent as it is, and it is also the Splatter\u2019s biggest weakness.\nIt\u2019s 2018 and its seems like everyone has super bargain-bin phone in their lineup. And when everyone\u2019s super, no one is. (I'm just hyped for The Incredibles 2.)\nThe Coolpad Splatter is the phone for people who want maximum bang for minimum buck with extra weight put on minimum buck.\nTo those used to their fancy Galaxy S\u2019s and iPhones, given their dominance of the historically flagship-centric US smartphone market, the Splatter is an exercise in setting expectations. It can't begin to compete with an American consumer's first phone choice, but it doesn't have to. The same way the $200 HP Stream both can't and doesn't have to go toe-to-toe with a top-end MacBook.\nAt a price a mere fraction of the cost of a new high-end handset, it's immediately clear that you won\u2019t be getting all of the bells-and-whistles nor the software support of one. Your resident tech geek won\u2019t be left in awe, nobody will marvel at its design or bezels, but that\u2019s not the point - the question that the Splatter and its many competitors ask is: \u201care the extra four-to-eight Benjamins worth it?\u201d\nAnd if you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t care quite as much about bezels and greater numbers, and there\u2019s many of you, it's a tempting proposition.Coolpad Splatter. The Mitsubishi Mirage of phones.\nIt brings to the table bargain price, bargain value, with none of the potential risk you might take on when buying used as it includes a warranty. Above all, it\u2019ll still get you there at the end of the day.\nWhile the Splatter\u2019s greatest strength is its sheer value, its greatest weakness, as I may have alluded to, is its direct competitors. It poses a tough case against purchasing a high-end phone for basic users, but when pitted against direct competitors, and even phones edging into the midrange, the Splatter\u2019s appeal begins to waver and the questions begin to fly.\u201cWhy the Splatter and not, say, a Moto E4?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not spend an extra __ amount and get ___ phone?\u201d\n\"Why not get an older phone that's used?\"\nThey\u2019re difficult questions, and it comes down to what the user values and specific pricing. I'm someone who doesn't mind buying used, but I also weigh the headache risk as less than the money saved.HARDWARE\nThe Splatter is a sizable Android handset featuring a utilitarian design.\nThe exterior consists of a grey plastic back cover, black glass face and black plastic midframe.\nThe rear features a microphone hole, the Splatter\u2019s main camera, LED flash and a rear-facing speaker of decent loudness and clarity. (just a hair softer than my iPhone SE)\nThe aforementioned grey cover is adorned with the Coolpad logo and textured with a fine hexagonal pattern, a finish that I find stylish, if subtle. I wouldn't mind seeing this texture elsewhere.\nThe cover is also removable and snapping it off grants access to the phone\u2019s 2,500 milliamp-hour battery, microSD card slot and nano-SIM slot as well as exposing a run-of-the-mill black plastic midframe peppered with phillips screws. (I don't plan on opening this one.)\nOn the left and right edges of the Splatter, you will find the volume and power keys respectively \u2013 both have respectable feedback, travel and \u201cclicky-ness.\u201d The top includes a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack placed two-thirds to the right and the bottom, a microUSB port - also on the right side.\nThe face of the Splatter shows off its sizable 5.5-inch display, notification light, front-facing camera, proximity and ambient light sensors as well as an earpiece and microphone hidden amongst a pattern of dots in the plastic border. Three soft keys adorn the bottom border, which are \u2013 left-to-right \u2013 multitasking, home, and back. It\u2019s an inverted layout compared to what I expect and I\u2019m not particularly used to seeing this but it\u2019s one I\u2019m starting to see more often and don\u2019t mind the inversion at all.\nUnder the hood, the Splatter packs...Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 (1.4 GHz, quad-core)2 GB of RAM16 GB of storage + microSD slot5.5\" 720p IPS display8 MP rear camera + LED flash5 MP front-facing camera2,500 mAh removable batteryAccelerometer, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor5.9 ounces, 6.0 x 3.0 x 0.33 inches\nOverall these are respectable specifications. The Snapdragon 435 keeps things running at a brisk pace during general use for the most part and I'll be covering performance in some more detail in the next section.\n2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage is perfectly sufficient for my needs (barring my music collection) and light users should be fine with it. The multitasking maniac may feel constrained and the media maven will definitely want to throw in a microSD card. Those may want to look elsewhere though unless on the tightest of budgets.\nThe window into the device is a 5.5-inch, 720p IPS LCD, which I frankly find excellent. Lower resolution panels don't bother me all that much personally. Viewing angles are good, and some backlight brightness inconsistency can be seen if you look hard for it at the edges, but isn't noticeable in day-to-day use. It's a strong point of the Splatter.\nDo know that I\u2019m not a VR user and don\u2019t really count pixels. (For example, I would be happy with the excellent 5\" 720p panel Microsoft stuck into the Lumia 640 in most any situation.)\nAn eight megapixel rear camera (with LED flash) and a five megapixel front camera serve as the eyes of this phone. Is it great at capturing photos? It\u2019s objectively not great, but its serviceable. I'll have samples in the next post. Currently I have no video samples.\nBattery life is decent, and not anything particularly out-of-the-ordinary.\n2 days of light usage (with 2.5 hours Screen-On Time) brought it down to 25% and heavier, more moderate usage lasted through a day. You won't be blown away, but you shouldn't be left stranded on an average day.\nI wouldn't dare hand this phone to Mr. Mobile for a day at CES or MWC, but honestly there aren't a lot of phones I would hand to him.\nIn a nutshell, the Splatter is a well-rounded hardware package for the $100 asking price.\nMiscellaneous things to note also are:No 5 GHz Wi-Fi, onboard is 802.11b/g/n but no 802.11ac.No NFC (so no Android Pay, NFC tags, etc.)The specs state \"Wi-Fi Calling 2.0\" but I haven't been able to use it on Cricket.I got LTE on AT&T/Cricket, specifications state it includes LTE bands 2/4/5/12/30 (see the Amazon page for details)It\u2019s got GPS!The soft keys are printed and not backlit.The nano-SIM can be ejected by a sliding lever mechanism, unlike other mechanisms I've seen.The microSD card can technically be removed without powering off the phone. Whether it's recommendable without unmounting is something else.The notification light has been witnessed as red, green, and an orange/yellow. It appears to not have white, blue or otherwise mix colors.Phone calls aren't anything to write home about. They work, the volume may be softer than I expected but it wasn't a problem.No biometrics or other fancy features.This phone is single-SIMSOFTWARE\nRunning the software show is a close-to-stock clean install of Android 7.0 Nougat with some Amazon Alexa functionality baked in, noticeable with its Alexa lockscreen shortcut and \u201cCoolpad Alexa\u201d app - we'll get into that in a moment.\nOther built-in apps (or bloatware if you prefer that term) include:Amazon ShoppingTopBuzzSome Weather appThe aforementioned Coolpad AlexaCoolpad browser \u2013 which appears to be a fork or reskin of ChromeSound recorder, which is always welcome\nYou likely won't care too much about these beyond Amazon's apps but they're there and can be disabled or used as you see fit. I don't care for TopBuzz, but I'm sure somebody out there will.\nSecurity patch level is October 1st, 2017. I reached out to my point of contact and was informed there are no future plans for updating the Splatter beyond that. Android 7.0 is where the Splatter will stay.\nI can\u2019t say I\u2019m particularly surprised but I\u2019m still disappointed. Software support in this price range can be\u2026 spotty at best. Security-conscious customers would be better served going upmarket.\nOverall, the Splatter offers a reasonably fluent experience that I was satisfied with. Snapchat stood out early in my review period as a very poor performer but the problem has since been alleviated after I tested it again after the recent redesign.\nThe lesser performance inherent to this model appeared to manifest itself largely with longer load times instead of stuttering, which I found reasonable. Straining this phone won't be too difficult to do though, but it\u2019s perfectly competent. If you use this, consider using the Lite versions of some common apps.\nAlso, thanks to Android 7.0, split-screen functionality and other 7.0 features are here.\nLight gaming works fine and 3D games aren't the smoothest, the relatively low resolution surely helps. Casual users should be satisfied.\nAlso notable is that the default camera is a carbon-copy of the iOS camera app - the UI works about as well here as it does on the iPhone, I just got a kick out of being surprised when laying eyes upon it for the first time. Footage of its UI is available in the third post along with some other clips.ALEXA INTEGRATION\nA headline feature of this phone is integration with Amazon Alexa and it\u2019s a nice addition for those who use Alexa but it\u2019s not quite a killer feature.\nCoolpad has done a good job making Alexa easier to access with baked-in shortcuts but it still has its limitations. Pressing and holding the square multitasking key serves as a quick shortcut to Alexa, coexisting with Google Assistant and a lockscreen swipe shortcut is also dedicated to Amazon's assistant alongside the camera. Once the app is running, the notification shade also becomes home to another Alexa shortcut in the form of a persistent notification.\nIt's not entirely clear whether the Snapdragon 435 supports hotwords like \"Okay Google\" with the display off but that functionality is not present here, nor is there any \"Alexa\" voice activation functionality offered by Alexa's Android app, so this won't be replacing your Echo anytime soon. It's an excellent on-the-go companion though for places the Echo can't follow.\nOverall, it feels like the functionality was bolted-on instead of \"baked-in\u201d, but I don't believe it to be a problem as hooking in Alexa deeply would've been a sizable coding undertaking with not much payoff. It's a sizable differentiator with many people knowing about Alexa these days, and it might be just what the Splatter needs in this cutthroat segment.Miscellaneous software things to note are:There is a loud boot and shutdown tune that cannot be silenced. I'm not a fan.There are options for scheduled shutdown and startup, I've only seen it in an old Alcatel phone I once obtained. It's pretty nifty but most likely won't use it. I know some would definitely appreciate it though. The startup/shutdown sound might hamper its usefulness.The camera app automatically cranks up the brightness when in use, a tiny but much appreciated touch.Ambient Display is available.The camera app has a standard suite of manual controls.WRAPPING UP\nCoolpad Splatter is a phone that is, in isolation, solid. It brings together what I believe is one of many possible winning combinations of \"good enough\" at a low price. I began my review period with the Splatter priced at $139 and its value wasn't the slam-dunk I was hoping for, but since the price has been dropped to $99, it becomes a lot more competitive.\nCompetition is still a large threat to the Splatter. But where the original price made me balk, $99 definitely improves the Splatter's position. The older, popular BLU R1 HD - at the same price - is edged out and the more expensive Moto E4 and E4 Plus are no longer quite as deadly as they were when the Splatter was at $139.\nYou'd be getting more features with both flavors of Moto E4 and marginally less capable chipsets with all three but as a potential customer, it comes down to what compromises you want and don't want. There's still homework to be done and many more options beyond these four handsets.\nBut as far as the Splatter is concerned, it might be on its own in a crowded market, but if the price is right, like now more than ever, it's worth checking out.\nBe sure to decide how much security patching is worth to you before pulling the trigger. It's the Splatter's fatal flaw in my book, but when we get to prices this low, security patches aren't exactly flowing like they are in higher price groups so expectations do need to be checked.Coolpad Splatter at Coolpad.usTL;DR - 5.5\" smartphone is inexpensive, capable and a fairly standard low-end model but lacks software support. Competition is stiff in this category but it's recent price drop tips the scale in its favor. Alexa integration is a value-add.

In all reality, it hasn\u2019t been a day\u2026 it\u2019s actually coming up on a year. I guess the old saying is true; time really does fly when you\u2019re having fun, and I\u2019ve been having a lot of fun with BLU devices this year. I\u2019ve reviewed the R1 Plus, the Vivo 8, Vivo 8L, S1, Life One X3, and now I\u2019m rounding out the collection with the R2 Plus. \nAfter reviewing so many BLU devices, I can\u2019t help but think to myself, is there a place for this phone in the consumer market? Well, I believe the answer to this question is \u201cyes\u201d. In a world of smartphones where we are constantly being spoon-fed type-cast, annual offerings by nearly every manufacturer, forcing us to choose between Option A and Option B, BLU helps make the decision a little bit more flavorful by offering Option C, D, E, F, G, and... you get the picture. In this day in age where smartphones are looking to break the next mold on ingenuity and gimmicks, BLU sticks to the tried-and-true methods of producing a reliable and affordable smartphone lineup that gets the job done, and checks off a lot of boxes for a wide range of people. Enter the BLU R2 Plus: Power and Performance, with a twist.Pricing: The MSRP is $179, but BLU has partnered with Amazon for an exclusive limited-time sale price of $129, which is a fantastic deal! The device is currently only available in Black.Specs:\n- An Octa-core MediaTek 6753 processor (and Mali T720 GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 1.3ghz\n- 3GB of memory \n- a 5.5\u201d curved display, with 1920x1080 HD resolution, made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (400ppi)\n- A 3,000 mAh battery\n- 32GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n- A 13MP f/2.0 aperture main camera with LED flash \u2013 records video at 1080p @30fps\n- A 13MP front-facing camera with LED flash \n- Runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box\n- Dual Sim & GSM Unlocked 4G LTE for use with ATT/TMO, and other MVNOs\n- Bonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)Overview and Performance: Many of the BLU phones that I have reviewed lately have been their higher\u2013end devices, which carry a higher cost and/or offer some more refined enhancements. In the R2 Plus, BLU has pared the device down a bit in some areas, trying to reach a balance between price and performance, which definitely shows. However, one thing I want to reflect on really quick is the idea of a mid-tier budget phone. When we think the phone spectrum, traditionally we have the flagship tier, mid-tier, and budget tier. Well, BLU breaks the mold with this device and brings us a whole new level of economy-phone citizenship, which I shall call the conscientious ownership tier. A lot of what has gone into this phone is maximizing the experience for the user, but keeping price low, which they have accomplished. If you are familiar with any of the recent BLU devices or my previous reviews, then the 1.3ghz Octacore Mediatek 6753 won\u2019t be much of a surprise to you. This has been the mainstay in many of BLU\u2019s devices this year, and it\u2019s a solid chipset. It cranks out enough power for multitasking, a little gaming, and all-around good performance for your day-to-day activities. Where BLU decided to keep things a bit more flashy is with the 5.5\u201d 1080p display, which is rocking a solid 400ppi density. The battery life is on-par with many mid-tier devices, and rounds out the package well. All in all, the phone works well and can handle pretty much anything you throw at it, within reason. The phone does have 3GB of RAM, which is ample, but don\u2019t expect to be doing any high-end gaming or heavy multi-tasking. You can load a very reasonable amount of apps without noticing any shuttering or system slowdown, but the best way to maximize the performance is to stay on top of your app management and close programs every once in a while. Display: Overall, I have been very impressed with the graphics. The screen is the same 5.5\u201d 1080p display that the flagship VIVO 8 carries, which is a nice addition to the spec spectrum on this phone. The color saturation is good and the overall balance of color and temperature are sharp as well. Of course, if you want to change things up a little you can go into the display settings and adjust the warmth to your individual preference. The color accuracy is also more on the natural side, versus the ever popular over-saturation technique that Samsung employs in their devices. I am happy that the blacks balance out well, especially considering it has an LCD screen. Generally LCD screens have more of a white-color effect that makes some of the colors look light and faded. Battery Life: The battery life on this phone is ample, and adequate. When paired up with other BLU devices that have 4,000mAh and 5,000mAh batteries, it seems like a radical shift in battery size. However, when you look around at the competition in the mid-tier range, and even the budget range, you\u2019ll find that 3,000mAh is actually really good, and more than competitive. Unfortunately the phone doesn\u2019t have the quick-charge technology that its predecessors have, but the battery is also much smaller which means that the recharge times naturally aren\u2019t terribly long. Even at 3,000mAh, when combined with the 1.3ghz processor, the battery should last you all day long unless you\u2019re a video streaming warrior. With normal use and mixed media, the phone lasted me all the way until the end of the day, which is perfectly fine in my book.Fingerprint Sensor: The Fingerprint Sensor (FPS) on the R2 Plus is accurate and works well, especially considering that we\u2019re dealing with a phone that costs between the $129-179 range, depending on when you buy it. However, you can tell that it\u2019s not quite up to par with some of the higher-end BLU devices. There is a little bit of a delay between the FPS activation and the screen turning on. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a programmed delay or it\u2019s just as fast as the FPS can work, but you will notice it if you\u2019re switching over from a higher end device. Is it the end of the world? Of course not; it\u2019s a $130 phone. I remember back when phones cost $500-600 dollars and didn\u2019t have fingerprint sensors, so the fact that here we are just a few years removed and you can get a phone for barely over a hundred bucks with bio-metrics in it is an all around win.  Sound: The sound on the R2 Plus is probably the biggest disappointment for me. Yes, it checks the boxes and sounds alright\u2026 but it\u2019s not great. If you\u2019re just into listening to casual music and playing games, then you probably won\u2019t care very much, but I can\u2019t really advocate for that type of listening experience. The size of the speaker is the real limiting factor in the whole package, along with it being mounted on the back. I have highlighted before that I actually like the placement of rear speakers like this, and the same is still true. For the size and quality of the speaker, this one is mounted in just the right spot to maximize its volume and clarity. As you hold the phone, you don\u2019t cover up the speaker like you do with traditional rear-mounted speakers. In addition, your hand makes for a natural reflective surface for the sound to bounce back forward towards you, enhancing the volume and listening experience. But, at the end of the day, the speaker is just too small and tries to push out too much volume. Vocals are tinny, and you get some of that cheap speaker reverb as the volume goes up, which is variable and contingent on the type of music or sound that you\u2019re listening to. Camera: The front and rear cameras on this phone are the same as the ones that are on the Life One X3, which are pretty darn good for an economy level, unlocked phone. Not only does the phone have a 13MP rear-facing primary shooter, it has a complimentary 13MP camera on the front for all of your selfie taking dreams come true; complete with LED flash on both. In addition to the impressive photographic hardware, BLU included complimentary software features and enhancements within the camera interface to help you get the perfect shot! It has quite a bit of built-in features, all at the tip of your fingers. While in the camera app, swiping left-to-right, or vice versa, will change camera modes, which include: Panoramic, Video, Camera, and Beauty Mode. Once inside the specific mode that you want to record or snap, all you have to do is swipe down from the top to get the options icon, which allows you to change the camera settings to your desired preferences, which includes HDR, Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), and much more!Software:  As is on par with most of the BLU phones released this year, the R2 Plus follows suit with Android 7.0 Nougat, straight out of the box. BLU has been very consistent this year with implementation of Android 7.0 across most of their new phone spectrum, which I think is great. Taking a second to address any diehard software junkie concerns, I know some people are starting to expect Oreo with new Android devices, but I want to place that into context. Oreo is still only on 0.5% of all devices and it\u2019s been out since August of 2017. We will get there. Nougat just finally almost passed the percentage of phones that are still running Lollipop \u2013 let that sink in for a minute. So, having said all of that, enjoy the 7.0 experience. It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s sharp and it\u2019s here to stay for a while \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty darn good! In a world where many of the previous flagships are just now rolling out Oreo, or Oreo Betas, I\u2019m perfectly fine with a $100 phone hitting the market with Nougat.\nSpeaking of Nougat, the User Interface (UI) on the R2 Plus is clean, and sharp. BLU decided to stick with the more mainstream approach of the S1 and keep things running a more traditional Nougat interface. With a quick swipe down from the top you can access the quick-options, notifications and settings, and swiping up no longer does anything. Swiping to the right will get you the Google Assistant, which is probably my favorite feature that BLU has implemented this year. The overall experience is really clean, and I like it. It\u2019s about as bare-bones as I\u2019ve seen on any phone that isn\u2019t sold by Google, and I think it goes a long way to adding some credibility to BLU, and their design choices. Other than a couple of standard app formalities on the front page (Google suite, Duo, FM Radio, etc\u2026), all of other apps are hidden away nicely in the app drawer and not taking of valuable screen real estate. Of course, you can clutter it up all you want once you get your hands on it, but I really appreciate the simplicity and lack of bloatware \u2013 A+ on the software side of the house!Conclusion: The phone is solid and does a really good job in balancing price with performance, which is hard to do when you\u2019re BLU. There are so many different phone offerings that sometimes things get a little blurred spec/model wise, but it\u2019s important to note that this mid-tier economy phone brings the best that BLU has to offer when it comes to display and resolution. In addition to screen real estate, it\u2019s backed by a great multitasking processor and a dynamic duo of cameras that will up your selfie game, and allow you to take all around good quality pictures. In many of BLU\u2019s phones, the compromises are made on either the resolution, power, or screen size. With the R2 Plus, you get all of the stuff that you want to provide a solid user experience, along with capable video specs. However, these come at a small price. The battery is smaller, the sound is \u201cmeh\u2019, and quick-charge didn\u2019t make the final cut. So, what I say here is that the choice is yours. I think that the phone checks plenty of boxes for many BLU fans that want the full-HD screen and don\u2019t mind giving up a 4,000mAh or 5,000mAh battery, in exchange for solid 24-hr performance and saving $50-100. So\u2026 the choice is yours! It\u2019s definitely worth a look, and it\u2019s definitely an upgrade over last year\u2019s R1 Plus. \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one the new BLU R2 Plus, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 25 January 2018, with exclusive limited-time pricing of $129,99, and a regular MSRP of $179.99.

I am happy to report that I am just as enthusiastic with the brand-new Soul Impact OE Headphones. They take many of the same winning qualities that I appreciated in the earphones and then took it up a notch \u2013 BAM! And on top of their stellar sound quality and solid drivers, they ring in at a competitive price of $99.99 on Amazon, with a limited time discount code for an additional 30% off, bringing them down into the bargain range of $69.99.Sound Quality: The sound quality on the Impact OE headphones is phenomenal. A lot of the depth and range of sound really helps your music pop. Earphones are great; they\u2019re compact, they\u2019re convenient, and they help get the sound straight to your ear drums. However, no earphones can really live up to the power, all-around sound and dept that you can get out of a great set of headphones. As much as I like the SS19 earphones, I am equally, if not more in love with the Impact OEs. The depth of the base and the vocals are much better represented, especially with the volume cranked up. As far as headphones go, I generally shy away from them because they\u2019re just so darn expensive for good ones, and I can\u2019t roll with cheap audio accessories \u2013 cheap quality, not cheap price. Of course I want to get adequate bang for my buck, but I don\u2019t want to sacrifice on sound quality. Music for me is a great way to shut down the white noise and ambience of the real world, allowing me to focus in on my tunes and enjoy the listening experience. I listen to a broad range of music, but for testing purposes I really have a couple of songs on my playlist that I like to push through and test the listening experience. Right now I\u2019m hooked on the Planet Sakaar and Magic Sword songs from Thor: Ragnarok (the whole soundtrack is just epic), and the new World Through my Eyes mix by Depeche Mode from the upcoming Enter Player One movie. I can listen to them over and over, jamming out while I spend time on my computer. Digressing\u2026 The listening experience on these songs is more than excellent on these new Impact OEs. One of the problems I\u2019ve had lately with earphones is that the mids are not 100% where I want them to be. Either you get vocals, or you get synths; you can\u2019t seem to have both. Bumping up the on-the-ear Impact OE headphones has eliminated that problem. The music is well-ballanced, with just enough thump, vocals, and synth mixed to gether to get a great listening experience! The volume is good too. It\u2019s not uncomfortably loud, but it\u2019s right on the cusp of loudness that doesn\u2019t compromise the sound, but gives you enough juice to enjoy rocking just about any kind of music. Lastly, in addition to sound quality, even though they don\u2019t have noise-dampening technology in them, the combination of snugness and volume drowns out the entire world around you. I was highly impressed with the sealed off, noise free listening experience that these headphones provide.Comfortability: The Impact OEs are as comfortable as I can imagine on-the-hear headphones are capable of. I have actually never purchased a pair of on-the-ear headphones before because they get stuffy and uncomfortable after they\u2019ve been sitting on your ears for a while. To avoid this, I have always, always bought over-the-ear headphones. Well, apparently I\u2019ve been missing out because these bad boys are super comfortable. I took them out of the box immediately after I got them, didn\u2019t charge them, and put them right on and started listening to my favorite tunes. I\u2019m happy to report that a) I have ben using them for hours without any discomfort, and b) I still haven\u2019t charged them after a cumulative 5-6+ hours of listening. Yup, epic comfortability and stellar battery life. Right now I\u2019m just waiting for them to die so I can charge them because I\u2019m curious to see how long they\u2019ll really go for. All in all though I\u2019ve definitely changed my mind about on-the-ear headphones and I\u2019ve really enjoyed listening to them.Functionality: The functionality is pretty straightforward and easy to use. Unlike some of the other audio accessories I\u2019ve reviewed lately, you will have to manually pair these earphones, but it\u2019s pretty easy. From the \u201coff\u201d position. Just hold the multi-function button (the power button) for five seconds and it will put the earphones in pair mode (the light flashes red and green), and then you can easily select them from your Bluetooth menu. Other than that, the volume buttons are easy to use and built into the right side headpiece. The headphones are charged with a standard USB 2.0 connector, which is on the left-side headpiece. The headphones are rated up to 18 hours of listening time \u2013 Holy Toledo! Yup, the battery life is fantastic. Like I said above, I haven\u2019t charged these yet and I\u2019ve easily got over 5-6hrs of listening, spread out over a few days. I wish there was battery meter, but right now these guys are churning along like the Energizer Bunny. You definitely won\u2019t be disappointed with the battery life and power that is pushed out of these headphones! In addition to sweet tunes, comfortability and battery life, the Impact OEs also have a built-in microphone for phone calls, which is pretty sweet. It\u2019s always weird for me to talk on the phone through audio accessories, especially earphones/headphones, but it\u2019s really nice when I\u2019m out for a walk or sitting at my computer and I can keep plugging along while I talk hands-free. One additional feature that I really love is that the headphones still have a 3.5mm headphone hookup on them, which means you can use them for more than just bluetooth connectivity on your phone \u2013 you get the best of both worlds! Additional Features and Specs: \n- Rated at 18 hours of playtime (wowsers!), 2hrs for a full recharge, and 20 days of standby time.\n- Comes with a MicroUSB 2.0 charging cord, but it\u2019s very short. (charging base not included)\n- Bluetooth 4.0connectivity (one-touch pairing)\n- 33ft connectivity range\n- Built-in microphone for phone calls\n- Comes with a hardshell carrying case with caribiner clip. Conclusion: They\u2019re fantastic! I have been enjoying them ever since I took them out of the box, and if you\u2019re in the market for a fancy new set of headphones, I give them two solid thumbs up. The sound quality is great, the battery goes on forever, they have excellent power and balance, and the price is super competitive.

I was a BB10 hold out until the launch of the KEYone in June of last year, but I still dual carried my Passport until December of last year. For most the fluidity of BB10 meant that you could get serious work done without the need to worry about fancy customizations and themes. The ability to swipe right to get to the Hub and the clutter-free main screen allowing quick and easy access to the camera, phone, search bar and clock was, for me at least, a productivity dream. When I switched to Android, I missed the simplicity that BB10 offered. Blackberry launcher provided a lot with its implementation of programmable keyboard shortcuts but lacked any other connection to it\u2019s past. This separation of past and present seems, for the most part, bridged thanks to a new launcher being developed by Zinqs LLC. ZINQS Launcher for Blackberry 10 users has been my daily launcher since it\u2019s initial launch in late December and has only gotten better every single update. The developers have developed mostly Windows applications in the past but were eager to support the Blackberry when reached out to by a forum member.\nScreenshots are taken from my KEYone\nSome of the stand out features that this launcher bundles are keyboard shortcuts, the ability to swipe right to view the Hub (This is currently in beta, and Zinqs informed me that this feature is still being worked on), BB10 style quick settings, phone, search and camera shortcuts and lots more. The current forum thread about the launcher can be found here, and the launcher can be found from the Google Play Store here. The developers are active daily and are always looking for ways to improve the launcher to make it even closer to its BB10 roots. \nMy trusty Passport\nFor users coming from a launcher such as Microsoft Launcher or Nova launcher, you may be initially underwhelmed. The settings screen may feel lacking, and the inability to utilize double tap to sleep, or gestures to pull up applications may seem like a huge step backward. This launcher isn\u2019t built to compete with the feature-packed launchers, but rather to appeal to those who enjoyed the simplicity and appearance of BB10. \nWhen you first install the launcher, you will need to give it permissions to use widgets which is used to place the Hub widget within the launcher. For now, you can enable the secondary widget screen before the Hub, use Blackberry Device Search, and use either the BB10 10.1 or BB10.3 theme. You can change the app layout from 4x4 to 8x8 grid allowing for use on both phones and tablets. \nScreenshots are taken from my Priv\nZinqs LLC has managed to create a launcher for BB10 fans within four weeks, and it is better every day. For those who want to use a modern device but is the experience of BB10 then this launcher may be for you. It is still a work in progress, but it is by far the best option for those who wish to relive their Blackberry past. The ability to use Keyboard shortcuts, Swype to the Hub, and a BB10 skin makes this launcher one app that you should keep an eye on. It is available for free from the PlayStore. The first 24 hours allows the user to play around with the launcher, and after that, it is USD 4.99 or USD 3.49 a year. \nThe support thread can be found here. Just make sure you change your wallpaper from the stock one to one of your own. It has been reported that the stock wallpaper can sometimes cause lag in some devices. \nLet me know what you think of this launcher in the comments.", "time": "01-13-2018 10:59 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6136483", "text": "Welcome to Android Central (although you're clearly no newcomer to Mobile Nations)!

This is where gloves are great, but then I can't use my phone when I need to. Thankfully there are touchscreen gloves, and Mujjo's dual-layered touchscreen gloves are pretty great. Now, I have never known what a proper fitting glove felt like and these Mujjo gloves keep up that trend. However, they are some of the best fitting gloves I've ever worn so they aren't terrible. It's unfortunate that gloves never fit for me, but I'm okay with these gloves as they don't have a lot of wiggle room, though I do need to adjust quite often. \nThe Mujjo dual-layered touchscreen gloves are made with silver-lined nylon interwoven into the fabric. This is where your touchscreen sensitivity comes from and the gloves are covered in it. The dual layer is a wool liner and insulator which will keep your hands quite warm even in sub-zero temperatures. Since the silver-lined nylon covers the gloves, you will be able to interact with your touchscreens no matter where you touch it from. These are some of the most responsive touchscreen gloves I've ever used. There is also a leather strap to hold the gloves tighter against your wrist with a magnetic clasp. This clasp works great too, even if it feels a little loose it still does its job very well. The last key thing to mention is the dotted grip on the palms of the gloves. This will help ensure you don't drop your device while wearing the gloves and just increase your grip on anything. I did notice it takes a little practice to get used to driving with them. I am one of those people that lets the steering wheel spin back after turning and you need to adjust your grip just a little to allow that to happen. \nWhile I haven't been using my Mujjo dual-layered gloves as much as I should be, I have had no issue using them in my daily life. I tend to have issues with gloves because of the fit. As I said, the Mujjo gloves fit better than most gloves I've used and this really allows me to continue in my daily life without having to readjust them as often. When it comes to actually using my phone with them, I still have to adjust my usage slightly and use my fingertips to get the right pressure. That is again because of how the gloves fit my hands. I have also found I need to use a little more pressure than I'm used when wearing them, but it's a fine line because it's very easy to go from no touch to activating 3D Touch on my iPhone X. This could very well just be an isolated use case for me, but it is still something to note. One of the best parts of these gloves is that they aren't heavy, or too thin. A lot of gloves try to be thinner than they need to be, or so thick that they're heavy and not the easiest to use. Mujjo managed to find a very solid middle ground of warmth, weight, thickness, and usability. I was impressed right out of the package with them. Oddly enough, these gloves come in a ziplock bag, which I did not expect. I am going to continue to use these gloves until they fall apart.The GoodWarmConfortableWorks wellThe BadA little costly, not too badNo color optionsPalm grips can be bothersomeConclusion\nHands down, the Mujjo dual-layered touchscreen gloves are some of the best gloves I've ever used, period. The fact that they are lightweight, warm, and very usable just makes them even better. Despite how much I love them, I still think the price may be just a touch high for them. The cost isn't bad though, people easily spend more for less usable gloves. They cost $33.79 and you can pick them up directly from Mujjo. I highly recommend you do if you live in a colder environment. You can find them right at this link.", "time": "01-07-2018 10:15 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Soul SS19 Earphones Review", "thread": [{"postID": "post6128086", "text": "Soul has been around the block for a little while, and their new SS19 earphones are the latest in a line of pretty snazzy earphones. They aren\u2019t quite mainstream in the United States, but their website is chock full of products for you to choose from, and the SS19 is a solid reflection of the brand and what they are trying to pull off, and that\u2019s stellar music quality. \nThe life-force of music is soul, which I think pretty much makes the brand name for the SS19\u2019s spot on for delivering some solid music. When I want to listen to music, I want full spectrum sound with some killer drivers and solid punch in the bass, and the SS19\u2019s deliver most of this. However, the comfort, sound, and power coming out of these babies make them a solid contender, especially at the low price of $39.99.Sound Quality: Do you like to get loud with your music? I\u2019m not talking Sunday morning choir rehearsal loud\u2026 I\u2019m talking about dropping the hammer on some sweet riffs, and getting thunderstuck by some AC/DC. If this is what you\u2019re looking for, then I think you\u2019ll be tickled to death when you turn the volume knob to \u201c10\u201d with these guys. Volume is a really important characteristic for me when it comes to earphones. For instance, Bose has some pretty phenomenal sound \u2013 I have the Bose SoundSports for my daily drivers. However, they just don\u2019t get loud enough for me. It could be that my eardrums are shot after spending a decade and a half in the military, but most earphones really don\u2019t get close enough to my discomfort zone when it comes to volume. I am very happy to report that the SS19\u2019s took the volume level to the max, and allowed their good friend \u201csound quality\u201d to tag along with them. I put these earphones through the ringer and I loved listening to some of my favorite music cranked up \u2013 if you want a solid listen, check out the Thor: Ragnarok Soundtrack with these earphones; it's an audio treat. Now, the story isn\u2019t all musical bliss. There are a few shortcomings, which mainly show up in the mids department. The lows and highs are solid, and the synths are oh so sweet. The vocals really hit home as well. The only issue is that because of the massive amount of power these guys are pushing through the drivers, the mids get lost in the shuffle. It varies from song to song, but I guess you can only push so much noise out of a pair of earbuds before you start to lose something. Now\u2026 does it diminish the overall sound experience? Not so much. Really I found that I enjoyed the sound quality so much that I lost focus on a lot of the nuances that I originally jumped on while I was listening to them. So\u2026 job well done on sound quality.Comfortability: The SS19\u2019s are curiously designed, but not in a bad way. I actually put them in the wrong way when I took them out of the box, and then I was a little confused by the wires that were sticking up and away from my ears. However, after I figured out that the wire was mold-able it was game-on, and I was super happy with the design. It's a pretty novel design actually. The wire coming out of the earbuds has a mold-able wire in it so you can adjust it/bend it to the contour of your ear - super cool! In addition to being cool, they are also super comfortable and probably the most securely fitting earbuds I\u2019ve ever used. These guys seal so well that I can\u2019t hear anything in the outside world when they\u2019re on, and that\u2019s a plus! Wearing these earphones for a long time isn\u2019t a problem at all either. They\u2019re very comfortable and really aren\u2019t very heavy or bulky, so it doesn\u2019t start to wear on you over time. In addition to their naturally comfortable design, the SS19\u2019s come with four different sets of earbud tips for your individual comfort.Before molding the wire:After molding the wire:Functionality: The functionality is pretty straightforward and easy to use. Unlike some of the other earphones I\u2019ve reviewed lately, you will have to manually pair these earphones, but it\u2019s pretty easy. From the \u201coff\u201d position, just hold the multi-function button (the power button) for five seconds and it will put the earphones in pair mode, and then you can easily select them from your Bluetooth menu. Other than that, the volume buttons are easy to use and built into the same control module as the power button. The earphones are charged with a standard USB 2.0 connector, which is on the right-side earphone. As is par for the course, the SS19\u2019s come with a ridiculously short USB charging cable and no charging base. The earphones are also rated as \u201csweat proof\u201d, which is great if you want to hit the gym with these guys on. I will say that the earphones are actually snug enough that I think they\u2019re perfectly legit to workout in. One tiny negative area for these earphones is that they only have a 6hr battery life, but I think that\u2019s perfectly acceptable considering the power that is pushed out of these things. Besides, 6 hours of listening time is more than ample for any activity I can possibly think of, not to mention the ease of which it is to recharge portable electronics now-days. And if you get in a pinch, the SS19s only take 2 hours to recharge. Call quality is perfectly fine, and can be controlled easily using the multi-function button. The multi-function button is pressed to answer a call, and to end a call. If you really don\u2019t want to be bothered while you\u2019re listening to your sweet tunes you can hold the button down for two-seconds and it will ignore the call. Finally, the volume up and volume down buttons also function as \u201cback\u201d and \u201cskip\u201d buttons when you\u2019re listening to music.Additional Features and Specs: \n- Rated at 6 hours of playtime \n- Comes with a MicroUSB 2.0 charging cord, but it\u2019s very short. (charging base not included)\n- Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity (one-touch pairing)\n- Comes with four sets of silicone earbud tips\n- 33ft connectivity range\n- Built-in microphone for phone calls\n- Can pair with up to two devices\nConclusion: The SS19s are a solid buy in my opinion. Great sound, great power, and a novel design that works really well. The overall comfort and quality that you get out of these earphones is top-notch, especially for sub-$40 earphones. \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a pair of Soul\u2019s SS19 earphones, you can purchase them directly through Amazon, with this link: Amazon link https://www.amazon.com/SOUL-SS19-Headphones-Lightweight-Sweatproof/dp/B074V6YG19 --- They are currently priced at $39.99, and are eligible for Prime 2-day shipping.

Have you wondered what it\u2019s like to hang your hat on the bar ledge and sip delicious, carefully aged scotch while you talk about the stock market and make cheeky political jokes with your pals? Me too\u2026 for sure. Sounds great! This case may not quite do that, but it will make you feel pretty cool when you slide it out on the bar while you relax with a nice refreshing micro-brew. Welcome to the Incipio Carnaby, Esquire series \u2013 the case that dreams, not lawsuits, are made of. \nThe Esquire series case is a fancy little number that the dreamers and creators at Incipio have crafted up like the sweet ambrosia of the mobile accessory world, and sent down for us phone toters to raise a glass, and raise our phone status with. The Look: If you can\u2019t tell, I am rather smitten with this case. The design, the aesthetics and the classy woven fabric on the back of the phone just exudes class. It\u2019s different, and it\u2019s sleek, that\u2019s for sure. If you want a case that compliments your suit and tie, you've come to the right place. If you don't wear a suit, no worries; you don't even need one. This case looks good no matter what you're wearing! Sure, there are many fancy leather cases out there to compete with \u2013 I\u2019ve used some \u2013 but this is just on a different level in my book. I have been toting around this case as my daily driver since I took it out of the box, and it really makes me not want to get another case. The Feel: The woven cotton material surrounding the case is fantastic. It feels a little slick when you first take it out of the box, but as you use it that feeling quickly goes away. It\u2019s not overly grippy of course, but it\u2019s got a very good texture and feel to it that you won\u2019t find in a normal case. In fact, I even miss the case whenever I\u2019m switching back and forth between my other devices and am stuck using a rubberized/plastic case. The buttons on this case work well and the cutouts are very precise. The buttons aren\u2019t over-sized, and they have a nice little click sound that they make when you press them. Another nice thing about this case is that it doesn\u2019t dig into your fingers while you\u2019re holding it. This is the biggest case pet-peeve of mine (you know this is you\u2019ve read some of my other reviews). When I\u2019m holding my phone, especially when lounging in the recliner or laying in bed, my pinky finger cradles the bottom of the phone for support, and it\u2019s so frustrating when you have a case that digs into your finger; well, it\u2019s not a problem with this one! Security: The protection on this phone is also pretty darn good. Definitely be careful if you are looking to set it down on any surface that could potentially be wet. It\u2019s water resistant, but it\u2019s not waterproof. The case material is made out of woven cotton, so it can absorb liquids and other oils that a normal case would not, so be careful where you put down your phone. The case does have the protective lip that creates a buffer between the phone screen and a flat surface, which is fairly standard with Incipio cases \u2013 extra points here for me. Again, it has protective properties, but this is the kind of case that you\u2019re going to use in a business or professional environment, not riding around in your Jeep or going snowboarding. So barring extreme sports and maybe working outdoors in Seattle, it should be very good at keeping your phone safe from most any normal danger or chance occurrence you might encounter.Conclusion: I love it, and I think you\u2019ll love it too. It may not be for everyone or suit your individual lifestyle, but I can recommend this case for just about anyone, especially if you like to change your phone case often, or for special occasions. It\u2019s sleek, it\u2019s suave, and it looks great when you\u2019re wearing a suit or business-professional attire. You definitely can\u2019t go wrong with this case unless you\u2019re a scuba instructor or a deckhand on a ship.Pros: \n-\tLooks really sharp!\n-\tPairs well with professional attire and really impresses \n-\tQuality build materials and the cotton fiber is really nice\n-\tDurable, and well-pricedCons: \n-\tCan\u2019t take it scuba diving\n-\tCotton fibers can pick up stains if you aren\u2019t careful\n-\tNot suitable for alpine skiing or boating in the French Riviera\n-\tThe cotton fibers on the case could potentially snag if you aren\u2019t careful\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one of these sweet cases, you can find them over at Incipio\u2019s website: http://www.incipio.com, for $34.99. The Esquire case comes in two colors: Blue, and Gray (this is the Gray model). Incipio is also offering free USPS First-Class shipping in the continental United States You can also find the case at BestBuy.com for $19.99 right now, which is a great deal!", "time": "01-04-2018 11:10 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Velvet Caviar Case/Product Preview", "thread": [{"postID": "post6126204", "text": "They\u2019re sleek, they\u2019re shiny, they\u2019re fancy, they\u2019re trendy, and they won\u2019t break the bank; what am I talking about? I\u2019m talking about Velvet Caviar, of course. Velvet Caviar is a stylish phone accessory company based in New York (no, you can\u2019t eat it\u2026), and they have a fantastic line-up of cases for both Apple and Android devices. Velvet Caviar has a wide variety of cases that appeal to just about anyone\u2019s taste. Their primary bread and butter is more in the fashionista domain, but they dabble in cool cases with flames, granite looking slabs and a whole host of other designs (they even have a coffee themed case!)\nAll of Velvet Caviar\u2019s cases are TPU, bumper-style cases, which helps to streamline the production process, ensures that the cases fit properly and allows the company to focus their time and money on making aesthetically pleasing designs \u2013 don\u2019t believe me, ask the dishes! In all seriousness, I was a bit overwhelmed when I first looked at their website because they just have sooooo many options. Normally I stick to cases with standard colors, like: Black, Blue, Graphite, Steel, Gray, etc\u2026 The normal and unremarkable colors that match my cargo short and t-shirt decorum. However, this go-round I decided to venture a bit outside of my comfort zone and bring a little bit of color, flair, and style to my case carousel. \nIn the preview package that I received from Velvet Caviar, they were very generous. I specifically asked for two different cases, but they gave me five, and threw in a super cool battery charger for good measure \u2013 yes folks, they make matching portable battery chargers too! So, instead of doing one review per each item, I decided to put together a fashion showcase to allow you guys to see some of the clever, and unique work that Velvet Caviar has put into their case designs. I stuck mostly with the camouflage and marble patterns, but you can go straight to their website and check out their ginormous selection of cases that rival even the Kate Spade collection that you can find at Best Buy.The Look: The looks and designs of Velvet Caviar\u2019s cases are as wide and varied as the shades of the evening sky, and starry summer nights. There is no defining style or pattern that stands as the flagship of their case fleet, but there are several groups of designs that fall under a similar scheme, but have different colors; for instance, the marbled style cases. I highlighted a few of these in the preview here, as well as in my YouTube video. Some of the most popular case styles are the Cotton Candy, and Marbled series, which come in various colors and help you to accent your individual style and personality. If you\u2019re really interested in finding a case that fits your individual interest, I strongly recommend you mark off 15-20 minutes of your day and check out their website \u2013 I can almost guarantee you\u2019ll find something that piques your interest.The Feel: As I mentioned above, all of their cases are made from a TPU material, which is solid and fits well. The material is very durable and has extra padding around the corners for protection, which is characteristic of the bumper-style build. The cases have a good, rubber-like grip to them which makes them fairly grippy for a uniform/smooth finish. They aren\u2019t the grippiest cases in the world but you don\u2019t particularly have to worry about them slipping out of your hand. The cases are a genuine pleasure to handle, especially because of the showmanship that is built into their styles. If you pull one of these babies out of your pocket in public, you\u2019ll definitely get a few looks, and maybe a question or two, which is great if you want to show it off to your friends. Another cool feature is that most of their cases are actually lined with velvet \u2013 super cool. Protection: The protection in these cases is mostly the fact that they\u2019re just so good looking that you don\u2019t want to drop them\u2026 lol. Really though, they are a solid TPU material and have extra padding built into the bumpers. They aren\u2019t the most protective but they won\u2019t shatter or get dinged up from minor slips and drops. They aren\u2019t drop-test rated or MIL-Spec rated, but I think that\u2019s mostly because of the nature of their design process and their audience. Everyone is familiar with companies like UAG and Otterbox. Their cases are bulky, boxy, and very protective \u2013 also usually expensive. Velvet Caviar isn\u2019t your father\u2019s tank case. They are a refreshing, good looking case that is designed to protect your phone from the wiles of day-to-day life, and look fancy doing it.\nHere are the cases that I received for this review:Chrome Flames ($24.99 iP7/8 Plus)\u2013 For the inner Harley Davidson fan inside of you.Red Velvet Marble ($24.99 iP7/8 Plus) \u2013 Red Velvet isn\u2019t just for desserts!White Marble Holo Chrome ($24.99 iP7/8 Plus) \u2013 This one really stands out in a crowd, and the fissure lines are reflective.Green Camo ($14.99; GS8+) \u2013 Don\u2019t take this one hunting with you! It might not come back.Orange Camo($24.99 iP7/8 Plus) \u2013 This one is cool take on a classic camo-pattern design.Green Camo Power Bank ($34.99)\u2013 This baby has 4,000mAh of portable recharging power! Zing-pow!Conclusion: Velvet Caviar gets a strong \u201cyes\u201d from me. I have seen lots of trendy, designer cases when I go out shopping (especially at Best Buy), and I can say that I\u2019ve definitely been more impressed with the Velvet Caviar series cases than many other designer case competitors (e.g., Kate Spade), especially at the common price point of $24.99 for most of their cases. There are a few that dip lower, but that varies mostly on style, popularity and the phone it\u2019s designed for. So, if you\u2019re looking for something clever, svelte, and on-par with a the social status that matches the bold caviar name of it\u2019s designer, then I highly recommend giving them a look and seeing if they\u2019re worth your hard-earned cash. \nIf you're interested in taking a look at what Velvet Caviar has to offer, take a hop, skip and a jump over to http://www.velvetcaviar.com and see if you find someting that tickles your fancy.\nAlready have one of their cases?

Even cooler, the cloth-styled carrying case has a magnet in it to help keep it closed shut.Quality and Protection: The tangible benefits of having an upgraded power cord are more than aesthetic. The Powerline+ cables are protective, convenient, well-made and topped off with a dash of \u201cwow\u201d factor. The braided nylon is much more durable than the standard casing that normal charging cables are wrapped in. In fact, Anker has the Powerline+ series cables rated with a 30,000 bend lifespan! In addition to that, the Powerline+ series takes protection to the next level and makes sure that your cable doesn\u2019t get damaged from crimping, crushing, squishing, being stepped on, and all of the other various ways that our cables get abused on a day-to-day basis. Another added benefit is that the slick, double-braided nylon material doesn\u2019t get hung up on the other cables when you\u2019re trying to separate them from each other. This may not be something that is a problem for you, but I have two phones, a tablet and a lamp that are always plugged next to my bed, and these guys love to get tangled up and cause me levels of frustration that I don\u2019t like to admit in public. Well, I\u2019m happy to say that those days are well behind me. The Powerline+ cables are much easier to separate and don\u2019t get snagged, or bound up when you try to pull one out of the mix. It doesn\u2019t prevent them from getting knotted up if you have a spaghetti bowl of cables, but it definitely takes some of the frustration out of the process.Here is side-by-side comparison of the leading manufacturer's stock cables, versus the Anker Powerline+ cables.\nConclusion: I really like these cables. They\u2019re sleek \u2013 dare I say sexy? \u2013 well-made, colorful, convenient and all around fantastic. Are they a necessity? Not really unless you need a spare, if you lost your original one or if the dog ate it, but\u2026 they are a nicety that you won\u2019t find many other places when it comes to charging cables. Cables are generally just cables, but Anker takes the idea of convenience, style and protection, and wraps it into one little bundle of phone charging joy, all backed by a lifetime warranty! \nThe Anker Powerline+ series charging cables are available in various colors and sizes, and lengths range from 1ft to 10ft. The Powerline+ series cables are available in MicroUSB, USB-C, as well as Lightning Cable. The Powerline+ series cables start at $5.99 and go up from there (1ft MicroUSB). Most of their cables start off at $13.99.

In fact, they love life so much that they have named their new phone the \u201cLife One X3\u201d, which is separate from their VIVO series (fun-fact VIVO means \u201cliving\u201d). The Life series devices are one of their main product lines, and the X3 is a direct successor to last year\u2019s Life One X2. Are you interested in loving Life too? If so, then check out the details on this fancy new device which just launched today on Amazon with a limited-time sale price of $149.99, while supplies last (normal MSRP will be $249.99).Specs: Here\u2019s the rundown on what\u2019s under the hood.\nSpecs:\n- An Octa-core MediaTek 6753 processor (and Mali T720 GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 1.3ghz\n- 3GB of memory \n- a 5.5\u201d curved display, with 1920x1080 HD resolution, made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (400ppi)\n- A 5,000 mAh battery!!!!! (this isn\u2019t a typo) \u2013 with QuickCharge\n- 32GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n- A 13MP f/2.2 aperture main camera with LED flash \u2013 records video at 1080p @30fps\n- A 13MP front-facing camera with LED flash \n- Runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box\n- GSM Unlocked 4G LTE for use with ATT/TMO, and other MVNOs\n- Bonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)Overview and Performance: This is my first time reviewing one of BLU\u2019s Life series devices, and my initial impressions are really good. The \u201clife\u201d moniker has real meaning for this device, especially when you look at the specs. The MediaTek 6753 is no new surprise, and I have laid out my comments on it before in my BLU VIVO 8L review, but for those of you haven\u2019t seen that review I\u2019ll give you the quick rundown. It\u2019s a very power efficient processor that handles multitasking well. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t have the prowess of a SnapDragon 8xx series processor, but for multi-tasking, casual usage and a little bit of gaming, it\u2019s just what the doctor ordered for balancing your daily use. One big selling point for me here is the winning combination of the MediaTek processor, combined with a 5,000mAh battery \u2013 yeah; this phone really has a 5,000mAh battery in it. This phone is built for the long haul. In fact, it\u2019s built for more than that. It\u2019s built for life, just like the name implies! This phone will get you through morning, noon and night, and then into the next day, well before your morning cup of coffee runs out. Pricing: As I briefly mentioned above, the MSRP is $249, but BLU has partnered with Amazon for an exclusive limited-time sale price of $149, which is an absolute steal of a deal! The device currently only comes in one color: Black.Display: Overall, I have been very impressed with the graphics. The screen is the same 5.5\u201d 1080p display that the flagship VIVO 8 carries, which is a nice addition to the spec spectrum in this phone. The color saturation is good and the overall balance of color and temperature are sharp as well. Of course, if you want to change things up a little you can go into the display settings and adjust the warmth to your individual preference. The color accuracy is also more on the natural side, versus the ever popular over-saturation technique that Samsung employs in their devices. I am happy that the blacks balance out well, especially considering it has an LCD screen. Generally LCD screens have more of a white-color effect that makes some of the colors look light and faded. Where the display really shines in this device is in longevity. The 1080p display combined with the power efficient processor and 5,000mAh battery will allow you to binge video, games, and YouTube, all day long. There are very little compromises you have to make with this phone, and I like it.Battery Life: The battery life on this phone is insane. It is really phenomenal \u2013 I can\u2019t describe it any other way. I thought that the VIVO 8 and 8L were amazing with their 4,000mAh batteries, but just when you think it can\u2019t get any better\u2026 BLU says \u201chold my beer.\u201d \u2013 or root beer, if you\u2019re under the age of 21. It is nearly impossible for me to kill this thing in one day, and I\u2019m on my phone all the time \u2013 which is an understatement itself. I don\u2019t do a lot of video watching, but my screen is usually on from sun up to sun down, and I was nowhere near worrying about running out of juice. BLU says the battery life is rated at two days of use, which is pretty spot-on for normal users. I\u2019m sure there are people out there who could kill this phone in a day if they really wanted to, but barring streaming 1080p video on Netflix for 24hrs straight, you\u2019ll be fine. And in the event that you are so excited about testing out the battery life that you burn the midnight oil and test it out into day two, the phone supports QuickCharge, so you can be back up and running again in no time. The phone also comes with a 5V/2A charger, which is still using USB 2.0 \u2013 I wish they would go ahead and change this soon, but it\u2019s not the end of the world.Fingerprint Sensor: The Fingerprint Sensor (FPS) on the Life One X3 works well. As I have mentioned before, I really prefer having the FPS on the front of the phone, and apparently BLU feels the same way. Even though the 8L changed things up a little bit, I\u2019m glad they had a change of heart with this phone and moved it back to the front. I really liked how the VIVO 8 FPS was also a home button, which could be pressed down to return to the home screen. The Life One X3 isn\u2019t a physical home button, as much as it is a soft home button. You can touch it to get back to the home screen, but it doesn\u2019t press in. The FPS is accurate and works well enough. The only time I had any complaints was when I went to unlock it from standby. Once or twice it would vibrate and not turn the screen on, but I only managed to get it to do this twice. Every other time it worked just fine. It also has a little bit of lag when opening from standby. It\u2019s not overly slow, but compared to my Pixel 2 that I carry as a daily driver, it\u2019s not quite on the same level. However, I have to temper this claim with the fact that the Pixel 2 cost me $649, and the Life One X3 is $149. You have to make some compromises on your expectations when you\u2019re comparing arguably the best android device on the market to a $150 phone. Sound: The sound on the phone is very good, and definitely better than many other phones off the shelf now-days, especially in this class of devices. The dual-speaker setup on the phone is very much akin to the VIVO 8, and it works well. I especially like the downward firing speakers because the sound bounces right off of your hands, which directs the sound toward you when you're holding it. The volume is great, and it puts out some pretty good sound in the mid, to high range. The bass isn\u2019t spectacular, but it works well for watching shows/movies and casual usage. Oh, and bonus\u2026. It has a 3.5mm jack, which also makes me a happy camper. I know we\u2019re on the doorstep of 2018 here but it still drives me crazy that many flagship devices these days are leaving the 3.5mm headphone jack in the dust. They seem to think that tossing a dongle in the box is an acceptable solution\u2026 I respectfully disagree, and shall continue to lament the slow death of the headphone jack. However, today is not that day because BLU rocks and allows us the ability to plug in our earphones, headphones and auxiliary cords, so we can get our audio straight from the tap. Camera: The camera on this phone is very similar to the 13MP camera that\u2019s in the VIVO 8 (F2.2 vs. F2.0), which is pretty darn good for an economy level, unlocked phone. However, this time around BLU doubled down on 13MP awesomeness and threw a 13MP front-facing camera in as well, with a handily paired LED flash as well \u2013 they spared no expense (RIP John Hammond). In addition to the impressive photographic hardware, BLU included tons of built-in features, all at the tip of your fingers. All you have to do is a quick swipe to the left while using the camera to access all of the enhancements and tons of other options to help you shoot the perfect picture. I have definitely been impressed with the camera suite, which is built into the camera and allows you to make adjustments on the fly and doesn\u2019t require an additional app to tweak the camera or add enhancements \u2013 very nice! The cameras definitely get the job done. The only hang-ups I have are the image stabilization and noise that you get when trying to snap pictures up close, or of moving objects. Noise you say\u2026 what\u2019s that? The noise I\u2019m referring to is the sharpness and clarity of the photographs. You\u2019ll still snag a decent image, but the focus can sometimes give away the low-price underpinnings behind the camera hardware. However, it\u2019s definitely not the end of the world, and once you get used to it you can learn how to take excellent pictures with this phone. Software: Ok\u2026 before I get too deep into the weeds about the software, I\u2019m going to go ahead and address the elephant in the room. For those of you who are in the know, or experienced the problem firsthand, there was a problem with an update for the Life One X2 recently (it was isolated to only that device). When the update was pushed out, if effectively \u201cbricked\u201d the device, meaning it couldn\u2019t be unlocked or used temporarily until BLU came up with a solution to the issue. This lasted about a week until BLU was able to figure out the problem and get people back on track with their devices. As hard as it is to remain neutral when it comes to opinions regarding the issue, I must place it all in context. This is not the Life One X2; it is the One X3. Additionally, the software issue was limited and did not affect everyone running the device, and BLU has subsequently fixed it. So\u2026 rejoice and be happy, for the X3 is here, fun and fancy free, and amazingly cheap for the awesome hardware that it has under the hood. Getting more into the details of the user experience, I am happy to report that the device comes with Android 7.0 Nougat. BLU has been spot on this year with their phone releases, shipping all of their latest devices out with Nougat. I know some people are still die hard OS upgrade fanatics and expect everything to come with Oreo straight out of the box this late in the year, but I want to place that into context. Oreo is still only on 0.5% of all devices, so simmer down. We will get there. Nougat just finally almost passed the percentage of phones that are still running Lollipop (26% vs. 23% ... Seriously\u2026 it's still behind Lollipop). So, enjoy the 7.0 experience. It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s sharp and it\u2019s here to stay for a while. \nMoving on... With the Life One X3, BLU decided to stick with the more mainstream approach of the S1 and keep things running a more traditional Nougat interface, using the swipe down from the top for quick-options, notifications and settings, and swipe up no longer does anything. The VIVO 8 and 8L changed things up for a short while with their counter intuitive swiping from the bottom for settings and all of that jazz, but now BLU seems to have decided to change everything back to normal, which I appreciate. Swiping to the right will still get you over to the handy-dandy Google Assistant, which I absolutely love. All in all, I enjoyed the software experience and I\u2019m glad that they adjusted the UI to bring back the pull-down quick settings menu, and kept the app drawer intact as well. The overall look and feel of the user-interface is clean, and looks almost stock. There isn\u2019t a lot of pre-loaded software and bloatware clogging up the home screen or the memory, which is a winner for me.Conclusion: All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed using the Life One X3, and I have no hesitation in recommending it. Whether you\u2019re looking for a great experience without the high price tag of many other devices, or you just want a solid backup phone to carry around with you, the Life One X3 is a capable phone that checks lots of boxes for a wide variety of people. The Life One X3 is a quality device that lives up to its name and is very competitive within the budget arena. In fact, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s even a step above much of the budget competition, with its golden crown made of 5,000 glorious milliamps, and sharp 5.5\u201d Full HD screen. It\u2019s really hard to go wrong with this device, and I think that anyone that purchases it will be very pleased.\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a Life One X3, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 14 December 2017, with exclusive limited-time pricing of $149,99, and a regular MSRP of $249.99 - here's the link: https://www.amazon.com/BLU-Life-One-X3-Smartphone/dp/B0784VB4JX/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1513224699&sr=8-2&keywords=blu+life+one+x3 So, if you\u2019re interested in picking one up, I doubly recommend that you snag one now while it\u2019s $100 off \u2013 you can\u2019t beat this deal with a stick!\nPlanning on picking up one of BLU\u2019s new Life One X3 phones?

So, here\u2019s what an iRoller is:\u2028 A washable, adhesive roll that allegedly removes fingerprints and lint from your smartphone or tablette screen.What does it look like?\u2028\u2028\nThis is what an iRoller looks like, out of the box:\u2028\u2028\nHere\u2019s the Mini version (isn\u2019t it cute?):\u2028\u2028\u2028\u2028\u2028\nAnd this, my friends, is where the magic unveils:How does it work?\n\u2028\u2028The adhesive is covered with a plastic wrap, that you have to peel off, then slide the lid back and start rolling it on your device! \u2028For a phone, I suggest going from top to bottom. But, it depends on the case, so you might want to use the Mini, just to be sure, and go from side to side..\u2028\u2028 From my experience, your mileage may vary. On my iPhone 8 Plus, with a tempered glass screen protector and an Apple Silicone case, it didn\u2019t work wonders, I had better results wiping the screen on my shirt. Even with the regular size iRoller.\nThen, I tried it on a Note 5, with an UAG case and an inexpensive tempered glass screen protector. This case, being bulkier, the use of the Mini iRoller was required. And it worked a LOT better than what I previously expected or experienced.\u2028 So, is it the Mini? Is it the tempered glass quality? No clue. \u2028The idea is nice. The execution, not so much.Where can I get it?\u2028\u2028\nYou can get both the iRoller and iRoller Mini here for $20.", "time": "12-11-2017 08:29 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "[REVIEW] iRoller", "thread": [{"postID": "post6104074", "text": "Disclaimer: I am still working on a more stable photo setup to prevent blurry photos.What is an iRoller?\nThe iRoller was designed by Dr. Stanley Taub, a plastic surgeon, to organize his operating instruments. Somewhere along the way he realized the sticky mat he was using for organization could clean oil and debris from touchscreens. From there he worked this mat into a roll and marketed it as more economical than disposable pre-moistened wipes for your touchscreens. Also claiming that it is easier to manage than a bottle of liquid cleaner, and will easily fit in your backpack, purse, glove box, or any really anywhere. This may seem a little too good to be true, and I had the same skepticism when I saw it. However, the moment I saw the iRoller I knew I had to try it. It's just a weird and unique product so how could I not?Design and Usage\nYou can think of the iRoller like a lint roller for your electronic device screens but in a roll top shell. The shell is white with silver text that says iRoller, liquid-free touchscreen cleaner on it. I also received a mini iRoller, and that shell says Mini on it as well. There is even a silver circle to indicate which side of the shell opens. You just roll back the cover and there is a sticky mat roll inside. You just roll it over your screen and it should magically be clean. Once the sticky mat collects a lot of dust and debris you can simply wash it with warm water. You should let the iRoller air dry after cleaning it to prevent any excessive wear, unwanted dust collection, or making the roller abrasive. I have not tested the cleaning yet as I don't have much dust or debris buildup at the moment, though I believe it will clean just fine. When you're done using the iRoller, you simply roll the cover closed again and store it until its next use. Does It Work?\nThis is the question you all want to know though, does it work? That depends on who you ask I guess, though for me it works great. I was immediately surprised and impressed. What used to take me a cleaner and multiple wipes with a microfiber cloth I cleaned in second with the iRoller. Now the iRoller isn't going to add any additional protection to your screen, but it will clean it quickly and efficiently. It really only takes five to ten seconds to have a clean screen again, nearly new, clean. My iPad will get a funny residue buildup from the Smart Cover I have for it and the iRoller takes care of it in a few seconds. I fully expected the iRoller to be a gimmick, something to sell on late night infomercials. I did not expect to see it work so well.The GoodAffordableEfficientPortableThe BadHigh maintenanceCover can easily be brokenSome cases can get in the wayConclusion\nI was quite surprised by how the iRoller worked. I can't stress that enough. It really bested all my expectations and it's hard to beat at $20. It's definitely worth trying at least. At this point, I don't know if I'll ever really use anything else because the iRoller impressed me that much. Go ahead and take a look for yourself, you can find the iRoller on Amazon or on the Grommet, right here.", "time": "12-11-2017 06:55 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "RhinoShield CrashGuard Bumper Case,Curved Glass Screen Protector, and Back Protector for the Note 8", "thread": [{"postID": "post6098944", "text": "RhinoShield CrashGuard Bumper Case, Curved Glass Screen Protector, and Transparent Back Protector for the Note 8 ReviewPros:-11' drop protection.-Lightest case for a high level of drop protection!-Compact form factor.Cons:-Curved Glass screen protector is not full adhesive and has some touch sensitivity loss. It also has the dot matrix effect.-Dust can get under the front screen protector.-Back Protector only covers the flat part of the back.-Back cover can be a fingerprint magnet.Introduction\u201cMinimum Bulk, Maximum Protection.\u201d That\u2019s RhinoShield\u2019s motto for the CrashGuard Bumper Case, and it really is true! The case is as thick as three stacked credit cards and weighs next to nothing, yet provides 11\u2019 drop protection! That\u2019s just amazing! Please note that the CrashGuard Bumper case doesn\u2019t cover the front or the back, but, this case coupled with their Curved Glass Screen Protector and Transparent Back Protector gives you protection on all sides, while still keeping with the goal of \u201cMinimum Bulk, Maximum Protection\u201dIn addition to the CrashGuard Bumper Case, Rhinoshield offers a SolidSuit Case and a PlayProof case for select phones, for those who want more back protection. The PlayProof offers either a matte design, or you can have it personalized with a quote or with a jersey style design. Finally, the SolidSuit is more about textures, offering the feel of brushed steel, marble, and a carbon fiber finish. Unfortunately, neither the PlayProof nor the SolidSuit is available on the Note 8 at this time.How does it compare to the competition? Read on and find out!Protection, Curved Glass Screen Protector, and Transparent Back ProtectorThe Rhinoshield CrashGuard Bumper case is as thick as three stacked credit cards, which is roughly as thick as the sides of a typical case, yet provides 11\u2019 impact protection! Rhinoshield claims that their hard polycarbonate outer layer is designed to stand up to all kinds of stress as well as drops and impacts, while the inner layer is made up of a special blend of polymers and molded into a hexagonal structure which helps to absorb and presumably dissipate the impact. In fact, the hexagonal structure adds an additional 15% shock dispersion capability. The lip of the case is a good size at the top and bottom, providing good protection for face drops. I have dropped the phone a few times from normal heights with this case on, and there was no damage to the phone, and only very minor damage to the case. The protection on the S-Pen corner is very good, providing a rigid frame around the S-Pen. This is something that some cases for the Note series neglect or at least have some deficiency.The Rhinoshield tempered glass screen protector is offered with a black border and with a transparent border, and is designed to perfectly compliment the CrashGuard Bumper Case. I chose the black one because I didn\u2019t want to see the halos on the edges. I have used this setup for a few months now, and no halo has appeared. The curved edges of the screen protector follow the edges of the Note 8 well, however, the adhesive is only on the edges, and as such reduces the touch sensitivity. To my knowledge, there is only one tempered glass sceen protector that has full adhesive, the Whitestone Dome Glass but it is complicated to install whereas the RhinoShield one is very easy to install. Also, RhinoShield provides two glass screen protectors for significantly less than the cost of one of the Whitestone screen protectors. The RhinoShield has what I like to call the dot matrix effect. Although it isn\u2019t normally visible under normal usage unless under certain odd angles, or under direct sunlight. I tried to take a picture of this effect but it was not visible in any of my test shots. It also has an oleophobic coating which resists fingerprints, making it easy to clean, and also makes it smoother to touch. Finally, some dust can get under the screen protector, because it isn\u2019t a full adhesive protector. The back protector is transparent and also provides impact protection, which will help to keep the back of the phone from cracking when it is subjected to impact shock. RhinoShield claims that it can take 5 times the impact energy of normal screen protectors. That\u2019s pretty amazing! The installation of the back protector was pretty easy and straightforward. RhinoShield claims light fingerprint and scratch resistance. The scratch resistance is decent, I have used other transparent back cases, and they tended to get scratched up pretty quickly, whereas this back protector only has a few light scuffs even after a few months of usage. Fingerprints though are another story. I noticed that the back was usually full of fingerprints, although you can wipe it off with a microfiber cloth. I should also note that my fingers are very oily, so those with less oily fingers might have less fingerprint marks. Finally, I wanted to note that the protector only covers the flat part of the back. It isn\u2019t a big deal, but one should be aware that it isn\u2019t edge to edge protection. Fitment, Feel, and First ImpressionsRhinoshield did a fantastic job designing this case. It\u2019s really light and thin, for a case that provides 11\u2019 drop protection! The transition from the back to the side and from the side to the front is chamfered, yet it is still fairly comfortable to hold in the hand. The case provides a moderate amount of grip on the sides, but there are other cases that provide better grip. Still, I feel that the grip here is significantly better than the bare phone, and will be adequate for most people. The power and volume buttons require a moderate amount of force to press, but more importantly, they also provide a very pleasant click, that not only can be felt, but can be heard! The cut-outs for the headphone jack, s-pen, and charging port are well proportioned, the latter should be large enough to accommodate most third party cables, even ones larger than the stock cable. I noticed a little wobbling when using the phone on my desk, which, while a minor thing, can be annoying.Although I have numerous cases for the Note 8, the RhinoShield combo of CrashGuard Bumper Case, Curved Glass Screen Protector, and Transparent Back Protector is my favorite, and it is what I have been using primarily as my daily driver for the last few months. I can honestly say that I really like this combo!Why should I buy it?The RhinoShield CrashGuard Bumper Case is the lightest case that I know of that provides 11\u2019 drop protection for the Note 8! This is really an amazing feat, for those who want to have a near naked phone, but with great drop protection! It can be coupled with the curved glass screen protector and transparent back screen protector for even more protection against scratches and face/back drop protection. It isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s a great combo. I strongly recommend this to anyone with a Note 8 looking for \u201cMinimum Bulk, Maximum Protection\u201dWhat are you waiting for?

If you want to see the Samsung branding, then the Arctic Silver with the semi-transparent finish is your choice. \nThe matte finish of the case is smooth and gives a premium feel when you take out the case for the first time from its box.\nTo put on the case, just slide your Note 8 into the bottom of your case and then snap in the top two corners. If this is the first time you are using a Peel case, make sure you do this slowly and carefully so that you don't break the case. \nIf you notice you will not find any branding on the case. The case comes branding free and that's a good thing as it helps you to focus more on the phone than on the case. One of the reasons I love Peel.\nAt just 0.35mm thin, it barely adds any protrusion to the case or the phone. The case fits so perfectly that you will forget there is even a case, standing behind its super thin promise. However, a case this thin is hardly going to protect your phone from drops. So, if you are looking for that protection, then this case isn't for you. \nThe side buttons are where it gets interesting. The side buttons in the Note 8 are not raised enough so I have always had trouble using those without the case. With the Peel case, it becomes even harder to use these side buttons as the case closes even that subtle lip those buttons had otherwise. This is my only downside of using this case with the Note 8. The side buttons are harder to reach as the case makes it difficult to find them.\nThe camera and fingerprint sensor cutouts, on the other hand, have raised lips that make it easier to reach than without the case. Something that is a necessity these days with Samsung phones due to the odd placement of its fingerprint sensor. \nThe cutouts for speakers, charging port and S Pen are well formed. I did not have any issues with the S Pen as it was no different to managing it without a case. \nUnlike other Peel cases I have used (Samsung Galaxy S8 and the iPhone X), I found this one a tad slippery even with the matte finish. That could be the fact that the Note 8 is a huge phone and you cannot avoid it being slippery. \nIf you love thin cases, minimal branding, and simplicity, then there is no doubt you should consider Peel 's Super Thin Cases for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. You can buy them directly from the Peel's website for $24.99.", "time": "11-30-2017 08:16 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6127163", "text": "I've used Peel cases before.

First, I reviewed the SoundBuds Sport, and then the SoundBuds Curve, and now\u2026 I give you the SoundBuds Surge.Presentation: First and foremost, I have to say that these little guys are called the \u201cSurge\u201d for a reason. As soon as I fired these earphones up it was evident that extra time and effort was put into creating a set of earphones that really crank up the volume and the bass, which was a welcomed addition from the SoundBuds Sport. So, if you want to hit some lows and experience more bass when you\u2019re hitting the gym, or just casually kicking back and listening to some sweet tunes, these are the earphones for you. Normally when I first review a set of earphones I\u2019ll turn them on and get my initial impressions and then formulate some thoughts and then head back to listen to some more music and test the headset out some more. Not this time. After I started listening to some music I was enjoying the sound experience so much that I left them in and kept listening to more music. For reals\u2026 they\u2019re good.Sound Quality: The volume on this headset is probably the best so far out of all three Anker headsets that I have reviewed. It gets loud, but not too loud. The loudness is very enjoyable though. Sometimes when you turn up headsets you\u2019ll get some cracking, distortion, or notice some of the shortcomings in the audio experience, but not with the SoundBuds Surge. I even tried maxing out the volume with a couple different varieties of music and I was met with a similar level of satisfaction; loud and quality sound. The quality is excellent too. The lows are redeeming and very well represented, from the bass drum to other instruments and various lows. Mids and vocals are on point. They aren\u2019t forced, tinny, or lost in the rest of the sound experience. Highs are excellent, and blend well with the music. It\u2019s not overly sharp and ear piercing, but you can still hear the instruments. All in all, it\u2019s a fantastic listening experience, especially for the price ($27.99)Functionality: The SoundBuds Surge has a familiar control setup, which is quick and easy to use. The control module has the multi-purpose button for on/off, and the volume up and volume down buttons. Other than that, the control module also has the USB connector on it for charging up your earphones. Pairing is a breeze with one-touch pairing. All you have to do is fire up the earphones and select them from the Bluetooth menu on your phone and tap on the earphones when the name pops up, and voila! You\u2019re connected. If you run into any issues, you can hold down the power button for 3-seconds while they\u2019re on to enter pairing mode. The SoundBuds Surge are rated at 6 hours of continuous use, which is pretty good for a nice, on-the-go experience. I would wager to guess that the battery life is slightly decreased because of the extra power going into producing the excellent sound experience. The charging port is standard MicroUSB 2.0, and the earphones do come with a charging cord (no base). However, as with all of Anker\u2019s earphones, the USB cord is very, very short, so good luck with charging them in any convenient manner. Of course, this seems to be the case with almost every set of earphones I have tested out, so it\u2019s not necessarily a ding on Anker. One day though I\u2019d like to live in a world where earphones come with a 3ft charging cord. And last but not least, as is par with the rest of Anker\u2019s earphones, they give you tons of different sized ear tips and apparatuses to size the ear buds for your comfort. There are four different pairs of ear tips, and three sets of inner-ear supports, sized for your comfort and to keep the earbuds in place. Additional Features and Specs: \n- The SoundBuds Surge are specially coated and designed to be, sweat and moisture resistant, so you can use them safely and comfortably while you work out.\n- Rated for 6hrs of listening time!\n- Comes with a MicroUSB 2.0 charging cord, but it\u2019s very short. (charging base not included)\n- Fully charged in 1.5hrs\n- Comes with a fancy carrying pouch\n- Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity (one-touch pairing), and a range of 10m (33ft)\n- Includes silicone and memory foam tips and fins so anyone and everyone can find a perfect fit with sublime comfort.\n- The backs of the ear buds are magnetic, and they will stick together for convenience.\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a pair of Anker\u2019s SoundBuds Surge earphones, you can find them here, on Anker\u2019s website for the everyday price of $27.99: https://www.anker.com/products/varia...Surge/A3236011 - If you have any questions or comments, please leave them down in the comments section!", "time": "11-21-2017 01:14 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "HTC U11 Life Community Review: The best smartphone you can buy for less", "thread": [{"postID": "post6079114", "text": "HTC U11 is arguably one of the best 2017 flagship smartphones. HTC is now back with a midrange device, the U11 Life for just $349! \nThe U11 Life takes a cue from the top end U11 and builds on its unique liquid surface design. Only this time, the back uses an acrylic glass. Not to be confused with real glass, acrylic is just a clear plastic that resembles glass. That said, HTC has managed to create life out of this acrylic by bringing the same stunning liquid surface design to this midrange device. By just weighing 142g, the U11 Life is a delight to hold in your hands!Specs\nThe U11 Life comes with the Snapdragon 630 processor, which is Qualcomm\u2019s midrange octa-core processor, 3GB RAM, 32GB onboard storage and a 5.2\u201d 1080p Super LCD screen. If the 32GB onboard storage isn\u2019t enough, then you can use the microSD card slot for storage expansion for up to 2TB. If you are planning to take your U11 Life out in the snow or rain, then you should be happy to know that it is IP67 rated. The U11 Life is dust, splash and water resistant up to 1 meter of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. \nIf you are looking for that one port that is hard to find these days on a smartphone, then you will not find it in the U11 Life either. There is no headphone jack. So, you are stuck with getting some nice Bluetooth earphones or use the HTC USonic earbuds that come with the U11 Life. HTC USonic earbuds are probably the best earbuds you will find that ships in the box with a smartphone. \nThe performance is great and provides active noise cancellation which is nice if you are in a crowded place or just want to get into the music and forget about the rest. And not to mention that these earbuds support Hi-Res Audio, so if you are into Hi-Res audio, you should try out these earbuds for once before you put them aside. \nHowever, one thing to note is that the U11 Life does not include a dongle so you can\u2019t use your existing 3.5mm headphones. That's probably the biggest downside to every other phone that doesn\u2019t have a headphone jack today. They usually do provide a 3.5mm dongle in the box. \nThe U11 Life uses the USB Type-C port for charging and the weird thing about this port is its location. Unlike other phones, the charging port is located on the far right and not in the middle in favor of the speakers. It took me a while to get adjusted.\nSpeaking about the speakers, the U11 Life does not come with the iconic HTC BoomSound. So, no front facing stereo speakers! It just has a single speaker. \nThe fingerprint sensor is located in a convenient location in the front at the bottom. Its not the fastest but it hasn't failed me yet. HTC Edge Sense\nAnd yes, you can squeeze the U11 Life as it features the HTC\u2019s Edge Sense which is available in the top end HTC U11 and Google Pixel phones. You can configure and choose your desired action for the short squeeze and squeeze and hold actions. For example, I have configured to turn on and off the flashlight with a short squeeze and launch the camera for the squeeze and hold action. You can configure to do other operations and even launch your applications for those actions instead. \nEdge Sense is also supported in applications meaning that you can use the squeeze actions, for example, in the Google Maps app, to zoom into the map or zoom into the photo when you use Google Photos app. You can also configure these actions for an app if you know how to do it. For example, I have configured to compose a new tweet in my twitter app with a short squeeze and then another short squeeze will activate voice-to-text using which I can compose the tweet quickly!\nThe Edge Sense also supports Amazon Alexa so you can squeeze to launch Alexa. Very useful if you are into the Alexa ecosystem. For me, Google Assistant just works fine!Software Experience\nThe U11 Life ships with Android 7.1.1 and is expected to get the Android Oreo update by end of this year. The default HTC Sense skin is pretty much the same you get in any other HTC device. Its a basic launcher with an app drawer and support for HTC Themes. \nThe home screen is as simple as it gets. To customize your home screens, just long press on the home screen to reveal the settings menu and then choose the option to change the theme, wallpaper or edit pages. \nThe launcher is integrated with the HTC Blinkfeed where you can get the latest news and connect your social accounts like twitter, youtube and many more. If you don\u2019t like the Blinkfeed, you can always turn it off on the home screen page settings. \nThe app drawer is also customizable with few options. You can sort apps alphabetically or by most recent or the way you like. You can search for apps and navigate to the Play Store from the app drawer. Hit that 3 dot button and you can manage more settings like changing the wallpaper of the app drawer and show/hide apps.\nRest of the user experience is similar to the default Android experience - the quick panel settings menu and the settings app, more or less look the same as what you get with the default Android experience. \nThere is no doubt HTC Sense is fast and is great to see that it can deliver a stellar performance not only in the top end U11 but also to this midrange U11 Life. But the Sense UI is getting old. I hope HTC is working on some new update to the Sense UI as it feels outdated when compared to say the Samsung Experience or even the default Android experience. \nIt also supports WiFi calling and Voice-over LTE if your network carrier supports it. Here in the US, U11 Life is fully compatible with T-Mobile and ATT while it supports Verizon\u2019s common radio bands but does not provide those advanced features. Camera\nThe U11 life comes with a 16MP front and rear cameras with a f/2.0 aperture. However, there is no optical image stabilization. The camera software is the same as you will find in other recent HTC phones like the U11. It comes with many modes including the PRO mode which gives you options to control specific settings your shot. \nHowever, I noticed the default exposure level to be very low and many times I had to increase the exposure to get a good shot. Maybe this is a software bug or it is probably the limitation of the camera sensor used. Also, the shutter speed is slow and sometimes I get the message that the photo is being processed after pressing the shutter button while shooting in RAW or HDR. Yes, the PRO mode supports shooting pictures in RAW format.\nThe pictures aren\u2019t bad, but they are not the best. It's not a fast shooter but I think I like the pictures. I found the colors balanced well when the exposure is set right. For $349, I will take it.\nThe rear camera supports 4k video recording with Hi-Res audio. You can configure those once you switch to the video mode. While there is no optical image stabilization, when you take videos, the electronic image stabilization kicks in. Here is a sample FHD video I recorded with the U11 Life. Performance\nThe Snapdragon 630 comes packed with an octa-core processor and Adreno 508 GPU that helps a lot in powerful software and gaming experience. I played a few games like Alto\u2019s Adventure, MARVEL\u2019s Contest of Champions and the EA car racing games. Surprisingly, I did not find any hiccups and enjoyed playing the games in the U11 Life. \nHowever, one thing to note is that U11 Life still uses a midrange processor with just 3GB of RAM which means it could be slower to load apps, games and it doesn\u2019t keep applications in memory for long. When you switch between apps, you could notice a delay as the apps could have been put to sleep instead of keeping them in memory. The first 1 or 2 could work but don\u2019t expect the same with every other app. \nI am surprised and at the same time happy with the U11 Life\u2019s performance. It\u2019s probably one of the best midrange smartphones you can buy today!Battery Life\nU11 Life comes with just a 2600 mAh battery onboard. Don\u2019t let that disappoint you. If you are a heavy user, you will easily get a solid 8hrs usage and if not the U11 Life will last you a full day. With a midrange processor powering the U11 Life, there isn\u2019t much you can ask for here with the 2600 mAh battery. You can always get more power by switching to the Power Saving mode. One good thing though is that it supports QuickCharge 3.0 fast charging so you can quickly charge your U11 Life when needed which has helped me a lot! Conclusion\nThe U11 Life is a remarkable midrange device and if your budget for buying a new smartphone is below $500, then you should certainly consider the U11 Life for its beautiful liquid surface design that is lightweight and for the software experience that does not degrade just because of its a midrange device. And not to forget that it is dust and water resistant that is hard to find in other midrange smartphones. \nYou can buy the HTC U11 Life for just $349 directly from HTC or at a T-Mobile store near you!\nIf you want the top end, you can, of course, get the HTC U11, else you will still be happy with the U11 Life.

[{"title": "Incipio Octane Case for the Galaxy Note 8", "thread": [{"postID": "post6076941", "text": "The Octane case is another one Incipio\u2019s tenured line of cases, which has carried over nicely to the Note 8. The case is durable, textured on the edges for additional grip, and it provides great protection for the device. The symmetry is sleek and adds a unique blend of security and form-factor, which gives it a competitive edge in my book when it comes to case solutions.The Look: The Octane case is sleek and classy, giving the Note 8 an added bump of color which is largely not present on the phone itself. The Note 8 only has a couple of colors, so being able to style up your device and give it a little added flair is a nicety. The Octane case comes in: Mint, Plum, Sand, Black, and Navy. The case is not very bulky and molds very well to the phone, without any noticeable movement at all. The sleek build is complimented with a textured grip all around the edges of the case, which is one of the main selling points for the case. So, if you\u2019re worried about dropping your phone or losing your grip, then this case is definitely one that you want to throw on your Christmas list. The Feel: The texture of the phone is actually a bit slick on the back, but this isn\u2019t traditionally the area of the phone or case that you would be holding, so it\u2019s nothing to really worry about, especially with such a large phone. The Octane is made out of a dual-infused material, with a translucent rigid shell, which allows a little bit of the phones underlying color to bleed through, adding a certain amount of contrast to the overall look. The textured grip is not translucent and blends in nicely, giving the overall appearance a uniform look. The button covers on the case are nice and snappy, and all of the cutouts are solid. One thing I\u2019m happy about is that the power connector opening is smooth and rounded and doesn\u2019t dig into your fingers when you\u2019re trying to hold the phone, which wins bonus points for me. I can\u2019t stand when I\u2019m trying to hold my phone and the cutouts are digging into my finger. Security:  The Octane provides comprehensive security in a sleek and grippy form factor, without having to compromise on protection. It\u2019s a great blend for anyone out there who likes a smaller case but still wants to have more enhanced protection than a lot of the really slim and skin-tight cases. The Octane case provides 6ft of drop protection, which is great for such a slim case. Usually you have to take it up a notch in materials and bumpers to get this kind of rating, so it\u2019s refreshing to see a more minimalistic style case with the added protection of a bulkier case. Additionally, the enhanced grip around the edges helps to keep your phone secure by going the extra mile to prevent accidental slips and drops. Last but not least is the protective lip around the screen, which extends just enough over the phone to keep your screen safe from unwanted surface contact flat surfaces \u2013 this is one of my favorite features in a case. Conclusion: The Octane is a really solid case that provides a lot of versatility and protection in a small package. It has grip, it has 6ft of drop protection, it has fancy colors, and it has a one-year warranty, all for the price of $24.99. For me, all of the reasons I mentioned make this a winner in my book, and I highly recommend it. Pros:\n-\tA great option for minimalists who want protection\n-\tThe grippy edges are nice and work well\n-\tOffers a lot of security and doesn\u2019t break the bank\n-\tThe cutouts on the phone are done well and don\u2019t dig into your fingersCons:\n-\tIt\u2019s not super cheap, but it is priced well\n-\tThe back is slicker than I\u2019d like, but it isn\u2019t overly concerning\n-\tEasy to take off. May be a problem later on (I\u2019m reaching here\u2026)\n-\tI can\u2019t think of a fourth con. It\u2019s a great case.\nIf you\u2019re interested in checking out the Incipio Octane case for your Note 8, here is the link: https://www.incipio.com/cases/smartphone-cases/samsung-smartphone-cases/samsung-galaxy-note-8-cases/octane-samsung-galaxy-note-8-case.html - they are currently priced at $24.99, and shipping/tax vary by location.

One such solution is SmartOmi\u2019s True Wireless Stereo Bluetooth earphone. I have been using the Q5 Bluetooth earphones for few weeks now and this is the review of the SmartOmi Q5 Bluetooth earphone. What\u2019s inside the box?\nIn the box, you get the Q5 earphone, dual charging cable, a pouch to carry your earphone, extra ear hooks of different sizes and a setup & instruction manual. It does not come with a power adapter though but good to see you get a dual charging cable instead of two separate cables. These are true wireless stereo earphones meaning that you can either pair them together or individually. Each of the earpieces has its own battery and Bluetooth receiver. Q5 design\nThe design of the Q5 is simple - a left earpiece and a right earpiece. No bands or wires in between. The earpieces come with a sporty look and with detachable ear hooks that are firm and comfortable in your ears. The earphone does slightly look bigger for its size and that may be due to the fact that it has few components in it - the Multi Function Button (MFB), USB port for charging and a light indicator. \nThe only downside of this design is that you need to charge the left and right earpiece separately. The MFB is the one we will use to pair your Q5 and to use it for other purposes once paired like answering calls or pause/play music etc.,Pairing your Q5\nWhen it comes to Bluetooth earphones usability, pairing is one of the key factors that is taken into account. How fast can you get going with your Bluetooth earphone? Apple and Google have demonstrated this with their own fast pairing tech recently with the Google Pixel Buds and Apple AirPods/Beats earphones respectively. So how fast can you pair the Q5?\nIt takes few steps to pair the Q5 depending on how you want to pair it. With the Q5, you can either use both the left and right earpieces together or you can use them separately. Q5 calls the former the AirStereo Mode and the latter independent mode. Taking this pairing a step further, the left and right earpieces can be paired with different devices. \nTo pair your Q5 in the AirStereo mode:\n- Press the MFB on the left and right earpieces simultaneously for about 4 seconds until the indicators quickly blink in purple color. \n- The indicators will also switch between red and blue colors at the same time. \n- After a few seconds, you will hear the prompt that left and right channels are connected. \n- Now, go to your device\u2019s Bluetooth settings and scan for new devices.\n- You should see \u2018Q5\u2019 earphone available for pairing. \n- Tap \u2018Q5\u2019 to pair.\n- Once paired, you should hear the prompt that pairing was successful.\nIf you are looking to pair your Q5 individually:\n- Press the MFB on the desired earpiece for about 4 seconds.\n- The indicators will switch between red and blue colors. \n- Now, go to your device\u2019s Bluetooth settings and scan for new devices.\n- You should see \u2018Q5\u2019 earphone available for pairing. \n- Tap \u2018Q5\u2019 to pair.\n- Once paired, you should hear the prompt that pairing was successful.\nAt any given point if you want to switch between the AirStereo and individual modes, you will need to first disconnect the pairing from your device and then proceed.\nThe only thing now left for you is to select the preferred ear hook and you are in for a good sound treat!Sound quality\nWhile I am no audiophile, I can at least recognize bad sound quality, especially when using my earphone. The sound quality coming out of these true wireless stereo is pretty awesome - sharp with a deeper bass. The bass and the treble are balanced well even with that deeper bass. I quite enjoyed listening to my song selection which comprises a mix of Indian, pop rock, electronic and ambient music. \nI compared the Q5 with the Apple EarPods that ships with the iPhone and you can clearly tell the difference in the bass levels. Its quite impressive that Q5 is able to produce awesome sound for a much cheaper price than its competitors. \nAnd yes, while its not mentioned anywhere, I can say the Q5 does give you noise isolation and but not complete noise cancellation features. Since they sit comfortably in your ears while covered, it gives you that noise isolation by design. Multi Function Button\nThe Multi Function Button (MFB) plays an important role as it is used to control music, volume levels and even summon Siri if you are paired with your iPhone. You can find the entire set of options in the instruction manuals, but below are some of the basic MFB features:\n- To pause/play music, press the left or right MFB once\n- To increase volume levels, press the left or right MFB thrice\n- To launch Siri, press the left MFB for 3 seconds Connection stability and Battery\nWith its superior connection stability, SmartOmi promises stable connection within 10m/33 feet. It's true. I did not have any issues going around my home or office with the Q5 paired to my iPhone X. I have had the LG Tone stereo headsets before and they had very little to none connection stability as soon as you a move few feet away from your connected device. This is something other cheaper Bluetooth alternatives fail to achieve, so I am really impressed with the Q5. \nSmartOmi promises around 3.5 hours of playtime at 1/2 - 2/3 full volume. I listen to music at that volume range and its pretty close. I was able to get around 3 hours (somewhere between 2.5 to 3 hrs to be precise) at that volume level. This is probably the biggest downside of the Q5 earphones. The battery did not even last a day and I had to charge in the midday. Another issue is that it takes about 2 hours to fully charge one earpiece. If you don\u2019t use the provided dual charging cable, then you will need 4hrs if you don\u2019t charge them together. The battery life won\u2019t be a big deal if you are using your Q5 between meetings and work as it has good standby time, nearly 80 hours. For me, this wasn\u2019t sufficient and 5 hours of playtime could have been perfect instead. Final verdict\nOverall, the SmartOmi Q5 earphone is a good bargain. At just $39.99, you will get a superior sound that is hard to find with other cheaper Bluetooth alternatives. With a comfortable design and flexibility in pairing the earpieces individually or together, the SmartOmi Q5 is a great choice for your sound cravings if you are looking for a cheaper Bluetooth option for your smartphone or tablet. \nYou can purchase the SmartOmi Q5 earphone directly from their website or from Amazon.", "time": "11-14-2017 12:37 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Incipio DualPro Case Review for the Galaxy Note8", "thread": [{"postID": "post6067515", "text": "DualPro is one of the more prominent series of cases made by Incipio, and it is primarily geared towards keeping your phone safe and secure. I have had the pleasure of reviewing other DualPro cases in the past, and this one definitely lives up to the name and legacy of its predecessors. This phone case has been as pleasure from day one, and it has been tough trying to get me to take this one off of my phone. The Look: The Dual-Pro case looks fantastic. I don\u2019t usually gush on about colors and all of that jazz, but this particular model has really caught my eye. The model that I received is Midnight Blue, and I love it. The color changes a little bit based on the light, which helps to change things up a little bit, and offers a surprising experience. One other nice addition in the color itself is minuscule little white/glitter specs which aren\u2019t easy to make out at all, but give it a bit of a sheen when they catch the light. It\u2019s not a glitter effect at all, but it makes the color tone of the case appear slightly lighter in direct light. It\u2019s not something that is overtly noticeable, but if you pay attention and notice the details of your phone case, you will definitely appreciate the creativity that went into the design. In addition to Midnight Blue, the DualPro case comes in five other colors: Black, Merlot, Champagne, Rose Quartz, and *Turquoise/Charcoal* (coming soon).The Feel: The case is as physically complimenting as it is aesthetically pleasing. The case is a two-piece design with a soft, rubber-style case that has a hard-plastic mold that mounts onto it, creating the buffer and protection system that the DualPro is known for. The case fits very well on the phone and isn\u2019t likely to come off without a decent amount of force. I\u2019m not generally a big fan of protective style cases because they are larger and bulkier than I\u2019d like, but the DualPro does a great job of maintaining a slimmer profile for a case that provides 10ft of drop protection. Of course, if you already own a Note8, you know that the phone isn\u2019t small. The DualPro case doesn\u2019t help make the size of the device any more manageable, but for the protection it offers, the size is acceptable. The phone is a but unwieldy for me, but if you are comfortable carrying around the device and using it then this case shouldn\u2019t make the phone any more difficult to manage on a day-to-day basis.Security: Normally I reserve this section to talk about all of the wonderful security characteristics of a phone case \u2013 and I will - but I\u2019m happy to report that security isn\u2019t the only major selling point for this case. This case is very well balanced and offers lots of positive features for looks, form factor, as well as keeping your device protected. The colors are unique, the form factor compliments the phone well \u2013 especially for being a protective style case \u2013 and it even offers 10ft of drop protection, as mentioned above. There isn\u2019t really anything I don\u2019t like about this case, which is unusual for me. I\u2019m generally very nit-picky when it comes to cases, but I plan on using this one as my daily driver for the foreseeable future. The DualPro even has the protective security lip over the front of the screen that allows you to place the phone face-down on a flat surface without worrying about the scratching up the screen. Of course, you want to make sure that you get a good glass screen protector to protect the gorgeous display of the Note8. It\u2019s a $900 phone\u2026 take care of it. Conclusion: The DualPro case is fantastic and I highly recommend it. With all of the gorgeous colors, complimentary form factor and security for days, you can\u2019t go wrong with this case. And to top it all off, you can pick one up for $29.99, which is a darn good price for what you\u2019re getting. Usually I\u2019m not a fan of more expensive cases, but this case is priced in a sweet spot that makes it justifiable and affordable.Pros: \n-\tThe colors are gorgeous\n-\tThe form factor pairs well with the Note8\n-\tThe security of the case is top-notch, and has 10ft drop protection\n-\tThe price isn\u2019t bad at all for what you\u2019re gettingCons:\n-\tThe phone itself is naturally large and bulky, and adding a case doesn\u2019t help\n-\tYeah\u2026 I\u2019ve got nothing. It\u2019s a great case and I love it.\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a DualPro case for your Note8, you can check them out over at Incipio\u2019s website: https://www.incipio.com/cases/smartphone-cases/samsung-smartphone-cases/samsung-galaxy-note-8-cases/dualpro-samsung-galaxy-note-8-case.html - They are currently priced at $29.99, and taxes/shipping will vary by location.

I love the look and feel of genuine wood products (I mean who doesn\u2019t) and it\u2019s no different with cases and gadget accessories. Aside from looking great, they also bring a sense of class to my life which I enjoy. However, I\u2019m torn, because although I love real wood accessories, I\u2019m a minimalist. That means that no matter how gorgeous a case is, I will almost always take it off after a few weeks because I much prefer the natural feel of my phone or gadget. Thankfully, skins allow me to have something that\u2019s both minimal and stylish giving me the best of both worlds and thanks to companies like TOAST, I can now have a gorgeous, real wood cover for my stuff, without having to deal with a bulky case.  Real Wood is Better Than Fake Wood\nTOAST is a company that makes real wood skins for a wide range of products. They cover (ha ha) everything from phones to game consoles and they recently sent me a genuine bamboo skin for my MacBook Pro. I even got to choose a design to go in place of the iconic apple logo. This thing is gorgeous. It\u2019s a little tedious to get installed, especially if you opt for the additional bottom and side covers, but once you get it on there, it\u2019s absolutely stunning. I put my skin on (on my computer, not myself...I\u2019m not an alien) and promptly got several comments at work about how awesome it looked and all of my co-workers were immediately asking where I got it from; here if you\u2019re wondering. \nI just have to say, I\u2019m smitten. My computer looks dope (that\u2019s teenager speak for \u201ccool\u201d). This stuff is real bamboo. It\u2019s not the fake imitation stuff that\u2019s out there, nor is it just a bland piece of colored adhesive. It\u2019s actually wood, which is even more impressive considering how thin it is. It\u2019s not a case; it\u2019s a skin. It\u2019s not something you snap on that\u2019s going to add a whole bunch of bulk to your computer. It\u2019s several pieces of precisely cut bamboo that adheres and fits perfectly to your computer. Now, being a skin, it\u2019s not going to help much if you\u2019re prone to dropping laptops off of buildings or out of computer bags, but I would hope for most of us that that\u2019s not the case (tee hee). For me, my biggest concern is scratches from those pesky coffee shop tables (I\u2019ve already acquired one or two since I bought my laptop) and luckily, this thing will provide ample protection against scratches (it will also cover them up so my OCD doesn\u2019t have to look at them). Options for Days...Literally\nMy favorite part of this skin is how customizable it is. Beyond just looking cool because it\u2019s wood, TOAST offers a wide variety of customization options. These options depend on the device you are trying to cover, but for most of them you can choose from multiple types of wood. You can also choose either to have one of their own very cool designs etched into the skin, or some products allow for you to upload a logo of your choice. I went with my own design and LOVE it. It looks so good. For some of the smaller products, they even offer inlay options which means you can have patterns of different colors of wood. It\u2019s really cool, as are all of the options they offer and it quite honestly took me a couple of days to decide what I wanted. Wood I Buy It...Absolutely!\nAs you might expect, being made of real wood, these are not the cheapest things on the market. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how inexpensive these are. The prices vary widely depending on the options you choose, but honestly their prices are about on par with what you\u2019d expect from any other real wood case. For phones, starting around $35 is a very reasonable asking price for a genuine wood skin. This entire package for my MacBook Pro here is $114 on their website, but again that includes the bottom, the side wraps, and a custom logo. TOAST has also worked very hard to ensure that as many devices as possible are covered. They offer quite an impressive collection of skins so don\u2019t worry about not being able to find something for your device. \nWhat else can I say? I do need to let you know that during my testing time, the small side wrap on the back right corner of my MacBook Pro got hit by the lid as I was opening the computer and it did damage the wrap. However, TOAST sent me a new piece and I have not had any issues with the replacement. \nIf you\u2019re a minimalist who has been discouraged by the lack of gorgeous options for customizing while still protecting your device, TOAST has you covered. I also absolutely recommend their skins for anyone, not just the minimalists. TOAST has found a great way to class up your already premium device while not getting in your way. \nCheck out their entire line of stuff at the link below.http://www.toastmade.com/", "time": "11-07-2017 05:50 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "SmartOmi HAP-1 Neckband Earphones Review", "thread": [{"postID": "post6056572", "text": "Looking for an inexpensive set of Bluetooth earphones that won\u2019t break the bank and offers quality sound? Then check out the HAP-1 Bluetooth earphones my SmartOmi. SmartOmi is an electronics manufacturer that makes a wide assortment of accessories and this is the first time I have reviewed one of their products. Sound Quality: I was a little apprehensive at first to review this product because I had never heard of SmartOmi before, and didn\u2019t know anything about their products, but I\u2019m glad I decided to go out on a limb and give them a whirl. When I first put the earphones in my ears, they had a nice weight and feel to them, and I was pleasantly surprised when I first turned them on and started listening to my music. The sound spectrum is good and the volume definitely gets loud. One of the features that I have been a little disappointed with lately is that many headsets and earphones that I have tried do not get loud enough. Not that they don\u2019t play at an enjoyable volume level, but sometimes I really want to turn up the sound when I find a song that I like. The HAP-1\u2019s will allow you to pump up the volume! Not only do they get loud, but the sound remains clear and I didn\u2019t notice any distortion. The highs and the vocals are good, but the lows could be better. The bass is lacking, which is a little disappointing, but the mids and highs help make up for it a little bit. It seems like these earphones are geared more towards casual listening than audiophiles, and sound junkies. I am a bit of an audio enthusiast and I want an all-around sound experience from my audio accessories, but the HAP-1 seems like it should be more than adequate for casual listeners and people who care more for volume and vocals than full-spectrum sound. All in all though it\u2019s a solid listening experience. My only other complaint is that the vocals can sound a bit forced at times, but that varied from artist to artist that I listened to. If you\u2019re listening to CD quality audio or higher, and the artist isn\u2019t overly nasally, it should be fine.Comfortability: The HAP-1\u2019s are pretty comfortable as far as earphones go. They only come with two sets of earbud tips, but they fit snugly in my ears. One thing that I liked about the earbuds themselves is that the housing is made of metal, which gives them a little weight and premium feel to them. I didn\u2019t try running in them, so you may need to exercise caution when you exercise, to ensure they are securely placed in your ear before you hit the pavement. Other than that though, even after keeping the earbuds in for an hour or two, I did not have any discomfort, and I generally have a hard time wearing standard sized earbuds, so I think it\u2019s safe to say that they were made well, and are quite comfortable.Functionality: The functionality is straightforward and easy to use. There is no pairing button, which is a trend that I have enjoyed lately. All you have to do is fire them up with the multi-function button (also known as the power button), and then go to the Bluetooth connect screen on your device and they should pop right up. There is no further pairing that needs to be done; simply click on the Bluetooth name when it pops up and you\u2019re ready to play! Another cool feature is that the earbuds are constructed out of metal, and the docking area is magnetized, which means that they will secure in place quite easily when you\u2019re not using them. When the earbuds are not in the housing, they can also be connected to each other with their using the magnetized backing. The only other things I want to talk about here are that the construction is solid, other than the wire covering on the main part of the housing that connects to two earbuds bases together. It\u2019s soft and pliable and seems like it could be damaged if you\u2019re not careful and get them twisted up or crimped. There are little clips that are used for adjusting the length on the cord that goes from the unit to the earbuds, and they pop off quite easily. I wish that they put a little more diligence into the design, but it works. Really, I\u2019m just being nit-picky, but it would be nice for them to address this in future iterations.

In the past month and a half, BLU has launched the latest in their flagship series, the VIVO 8, then the VIVO 8L, and now, drumroll please\u2026 they are launching the brand spanking new BLU S1. One important thing I need to mention before I get into the bells and whistles of this device is that there is an exclusive, one-day sale on Amazon today (31 October, 2017) for a reduced price of $129.99, which is a $50 discount off the normal MSRP of $179.99. Specs:\n- An Octa-core MediaTek 6750 processor (and Mali T860 GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 1.5ghz\n- 2GB of memory \n- a 5.2\u201d curved display, with 720x1280 HD resolution, made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (282ppi)\n- A 2,800 mAh battery\n- 16GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n- A 13MP f/2.0 aperture main camera with LED flash\n- A 5MP front-facing camera (no LED flash this time)\n- Runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box\n- Dual-SIM device\n- Bonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)\n- GSM and CDMA Unlocked (only Sprint CDMA, not Verizon)Pricing: As I briefly mentioned above, the MSRP is $179.99, but BLU has partnered with Amazon for an exclusive one-day only sale price of $129.99, available on launch. The S1 comes in two different colors: Black and Gold.Overview and Performance: The overall performance of the phone is good, especially for the lower amount of RAM in this device. For 2017, the recurring theme for BLU specs has been at least 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but the S1 has made up for some of this with a boost in the processor speed to 1.5ghz. The biggest selling points for this phone are the CDMA capability for Sprint's network (sorry Verizon users\u2026 maybe you\u2019ll get some love in the future.), and the price-point. The S1 is a very inexpensive phone for what it brings to the table, especially at the introductory price of $129.99, but I still wish they could have found a way to cram in an extra GB of RAM. Regardless, this is BLUs first ever CMDA capable phone, and I feel like they are playing it a little conservative this one, balancing out performance but still incorporating some of their popular features, such as the fingerprint sensor, Android 7.0 Nougat, and a well-balanced processor to help draw people in. All of BLUs phones are GSM unlocked, but now they are branching out and trying to access an entirely new user base, which of course carries risks. Hopefully this device will be successful and will open the door for expanded CDMA availability in the future. In the past, Qualcomm has held a monopoly on CDMA supported chipsets which has limited the availability of products to consumers, but not anymore. This bold shift into the CDMA market by MediaTek, partnered with BLU, finally places more power of choice, and price, in the hands of the consumer. It will definitely be interesting to watch this develop further. Display: Overall, I have been very impressed with the graphics, especially considering the price of the phone. The color saturation and sharpness are very good for a 720p screen, and the brightness is above average as well \u2013 the graphics and visual presentation are on par with the VIVO 8L, and the S1 even has a very slight increase in ppi over it\u2019s sibling (282ppi vs. 277ppi). The implementation is solid. 5.2\u201d is the optimum display size for 1080p resolution, so dropping down to 720p is not as harmful to the resolution or user experience as it would be if the screen size were larger. As I used the device, the balance between the screen size and display ratio became very comfortable and I didn\u2019t really give it any extra thought after getting used to the device. Battery Life: The battery life on this phone is good, and balanced. The MediaTek 6750 is a very efficient chipset, but the boost to 1.5ghz naturally increases power consumption, which will drain the battery a little faster. One other thing to take into account is that the battery is only rated at 2,800mAh. I say \"only\" because this is a smaller battery than what we have seen in the last few BLU phones, but the S1 was built in a way to maximize the features and abilities that it has, giving you a quality experience at an affordable price-point, which it does very well. One slightly disappointing feature for the S1 is that it only comes with a 5V/1.5A charger, and does not feature quickcharge, but the battery is smaller so naturally it doesn\u2019t take as long to charge. Fingerprint Sensor: The Fingerprint Sensor (FPS) on the S1 works well, and I\u2019m glad they decided to move it back to the front of the phone and reintegrate it with the home button. The accuracy and speed of the FPS is on par with competitor devices and won\u2019t let you down. The S1 does appear to be slightly more forgiving with finger placement than the VIVO 8L, which seems to be attributable to the slightly wider ellipses style FPS on the front of the phone versus the circle-shaped FPS on the rear of the VIVO 8L, but this is largely an apples-to-oranges comparison and really, both of the sensors work well and are very reliable. Sound: The sound on the phone is good, and the volume is complimentary. The vocals are a bit tinny and overpower the rest of the sound spectrum, but that's fairly common with small, individual speakers. If you're a music buff then you probably won't be overly impressed, but it's good for watching TV shows and YouTube videos, and it certainly works with music as well, it just isn't the phones forte. Speaker placement and design on the S1 is a bit of a shift from their more recent devices. The speaker is a single, downward firing driver that is located on the bottom of the phone, versus the dual speakers of the VIVO 8, and the back-mounted speaker on the 8L. I am happy that they put it on the right side of the phone though and not the left, which makes it more difficult to cover up with your hand while you\u2019re holding it horizontally. I am also happy to report that the S1 still has the 3.5mm headphone jack intact, which means that you can continue to rock on with your traditional headphones/earphones, and auxiliary cords. I may be a bit of a dinosaur, but I refuse to let go of my headphone jack. They\u2019re going to have to pry this feature out of my cold dead hands before I finally move on to the world of completely wireless audio. Camera: The camera on this phone is the same 13MP camera but it is lacking the Sony imaging processor, which I am sure is a cost-cutting decision that had to be made to get the S1 in at such a low price. Another disappointing design change is that the S1 only has a 5MP front-facing selfie camera. Now, a 5MP selfie camera is still more than adequate and you really won\u2019t be able to tell too much of a difference on a 5.2\u201d 720p screen, but when you upload it to a computer or try to display it on a higher resolution screen, the differences between a 5MP camera and 16-20MP camera will become very apparent. I was very happy with the last two BLU devices in the VIVO series that really swung for the fences with their selfie cameras, so personally it\u2019s hard to be excited about the 5MP camera that they included in the S1. That being said, the important thing to remember here is a) this isn\u2019t a VIVO series phone, b) It\u2019s only $129.99 if you can catch it on sale, and c) it\u2019s CDMA compatible with Sprint. So, all-in-all, regardless of my feelings towards the selfie camera, the S1 is still very much a well-balanced phone and on par with the competition, especially in a sub-$200 phone world, but the camera definitely isn't the crown jewel of this device. Software: I am happy to report that the device comes with Android 7.0 Nougat, which is expected now with BLU devices. I know a lot of people are starting to expect new devices to have Android Oreo on them now, but\u2026 this is a $129 phone and there are hardly any phones with Oreo on them presently, so I don\u2019t think there's anything wrong with choosing to launch with Nougat. BLU decided to change things up a little and revert back to the traditional pull-down quick settings menu from the top, which is blended with the notifications, just like normal Android phones. They eliminated the swipe-up gesture for quick settings, which I can\u2019t say that I miss very much. One feature that I am happy that BLU carried over to the S1 is the swipe-right gesture for Google Assistant, which you can access simply by swiping right from the home screen, much like Bixby on the Samsung 8/Note devices. All in all, I enjoyed the software experience and I\u2019m glad that they adjusted the UI to bring back the pull-down quick settings menu, and kept the app drawer intact as well.Conclusion: The S1 is a very solid and efficient phone with a level of performance that will surprise you. I have been very happy with it and I think you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a much better phone for $129, especially one that is GSM and CDMA unlocked. It\u2019s more than adequate for day-to-day use, and it even allows for some casual gaming (to my surprise I tested out Super Mario Run, and it performed without a hiccup!) It also has a capable camera \u2013 just make sure you temper your expectations to the price and specs of the phone. Will it blow you out of the water in any particular area? No\u2026 but it will last you a full day and get the job done. Another great selling point for the phone is that if you\u2019re looking to pick one up and switch to Sprint, Sprint is currently offering a $200 gift card if you decide you want to bring your own device over to their network, and the BLU S1 is on the approved device list, which means that if you decide to pick one up and switch to Sprint, the phone will basically pay for itself. Even if you decide to purchase one and use it with AT&T or T-Mobile, it\u2019s still a fantastic deal, you just don\u2019t get a gift card.\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a S1 device, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 31 October 2017, with a one-day only sale price of $129.99 immediately available on launch. The normal price is going to be $179.99, but during the sale they are discounting it by $50, which is a fantastic deal. The sale officially ends Wednesday, November 1st at 11:59PM PST.\nAs always, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section.

I am glad I did because this is one of the best wallet cases that adds great style and slim protection to the Note 8.\nThe Osprey case is constructed with TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) and PC (polycarbonate) materials that provide good protection around the corners and the back. Unlike many other wallet cases, this is very light. \nTo put on the case, simply slide in your phone. It was super easy and I had no issues putting on the case. The back of the case is dual design with the matte finish on the top (camera and fingerprint sensor cutout) and plastic for the rest including the wallet insert. This dual design gives a good feel to the case, especially with the matte finish. \nThe cutouts for the ports are perfect. I did not have any issues using the charging cable, the S Pen or using the headphone jack. \nThe camera and fingerprint cutout on the back is well raised to protect it from the surface. I did not have any issues reaching the fingerprint sensor as well. \nWith an ergonomic curved silhouette design, the Osprey case makes it easy to hold your Note 8. Even though the sides do not have any gripping material, the curved ergonomic design will give you a good firm grip. \nDue to the wallet insert, you might feel the case to be a tad thicker but that will fade away once you realize how good the construction of the wallet insert is.\nThe wallet insert uses a semi-automatic spring construction that makes it easier to open and close the insert without any troubles. Since its using a spring, you will have to open it to a point where it slides open automatically. This is good because it gives your wallet the protection it needs as it will slide back if you don't push it harder. \nLumion website says the wallet insert will hold up to 2 cards, but I was able to use 3 cards without any difficulty and it worked great! With Samsung Pay and this wallet insert, you can be free of your physical wallet. \nThe big downside to this case is that it doesn't have any raised lips on the front and the edges are also exposed such that they don't add any protection to the front. I will recommend using a screen protector regardless and it is a must for this case as it doesn't add any protection to the front. However, one good thing is that there is good space along the edges in the front that will give the space the screen protector needs. \nOverall, I love this case! There are lots of things to like about the case starting with its slim design, ergonomic feel, the wallet insert, and not to mention the perfect fit. You can buy the Osprey (and other lumion) cases from Amazon for $32.99 (its full retail price).

I have tested a few cases for the Pixel XL and this is by far the best feeling case in the hand.\nThe buttons are impeccable on this case, they are second to none.

That\u2019s not a bad thing, depending on your interest, but the reason I keep a case on my Pixel, apart from protecting the device is to make it look better, and this case, in my opinion doesn\u2019t do that. \nWhat I do love about this case far outweighs the only bad point I could find.

They weren\u2019t high-dollar, premium sound earphones, but they were versatile, affordable, and delivered pretty decent sound. Well, the SoundBuds Curve take the Anker sound experience to a whole new level, and they won\u2019t strain your wallet in the process. Initially, I expected the SoundBuds Curve to be a very similar product to the SoundBuds Sport, but I quickly discovered that was far from true. The comfort of the SoundBuds Curve is superior, the sound experience if better, it comes with even more wearables accessories, and even has a fancy carrying case to boot!Sound Quality: The sound on the SoundBuds Curve is very impressive, especially for a set of $35 earphones. In the past, I have been very, very hesitant of buying any sort of earphones that are less than the $75+ range, because quality and performance has been very unpredictable in my experience. Earphones are a different beast in themselves from many types of audio products because you can\u2019t try them on at the store\u2026 that would be gross, but seriously, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting until you get home and open the box. If I\u2019m going to spend money on earphones, I want them to be really good and I don\u2019t want to compromise, so I generally don\u2019t buy anything \u201ccheap\u201d for that exact reason. The Anker SoundBuds Curve has done wonders for changing my opinion on lower-priced audio-tech. The highs and lows are very well balanced. The mids are good, but can sometimes be drowned out or lost in transmission when there are dominant guitar riffs or collaborated vocals, especially in rock music. Vocals are natural and don\u2019t sound tinny or forced, which is a welcomed change from the SoundBuds Sport. I was also impressed with the clarity of the drums, (bass, hi-hats, and everything in-between), as well as the vocals. The overall sound experience was very well balanced and represented well across the volume spectrum. The maximum volume can be quite loud, which is exactly what I like in a set of earphones. Sometimes I really want to turn it up, but I still want a solid sound experience at the 75-80% listening range as well, and Anker definitely delivers on that metric. Comfortability: As soon as you put them in your ears you\u2019ll notice how snuggly they fit and how comfortable they feel. I may have used this term before, but Anker is like the Swiss Army Knife of the audio-tech industry. Just take a look at the pictures. There are earpiece tips galore! I didn\u2019t even think that this many variations on earpiece tips existed, much less that they could come in one package. These babies are designed for comfort and Anker makes sure that pretty much anyone can find a way to wear their earphones so you have the most comfortable and enjoyable experience possible.Functionality: One of the things I like the most about the SoundBuds Curve is that the earphone controls are on the module attached to the headset. There are no buttons, switches or charging ports on the earpieces themselves, which is awesome. It\u2019s so annoying when you want to change the volume, turn the earphones on or pair them with your phone, but you have to keep reaching up and pressing on the earpieces, which of course aren\u2019t anchored into your ear well in the first place. This was a wonderfully executed design for the product, and I can\u2019t say how happy I am that they did this. Speaking of anchoring, the SoundBuds Curve are the most securely fitting, yet comfortable earphones I have ever worn. The pliable curved hook-like feature attached to the earpiece fits comfortably over the top of your ear and holds the earpiece snugly in your ear \u2013 hence the name SoundBuds Curve. Finally, the earphones are very easy to pair. All you have to do is hold the power button to turn them on, and then they will show up on your Bluetooth menu on whatever device you\u2019re trying to pair with them. No additional button pushing, pin entering required \u2013 yup, it\u2019s that easy! Additional Features and Specs: \n-\tThe SoundBuds Curve are water-resistant to rain, sweat, and casual moisture (don\u2019t go swimming with them)\n-\tRated for 12.5hrs of listening time!\n-\tComes with a MicroUSB 2.0 charging cord, but it\u2019s very short. (charging base not included)\n-\tComes with a fancy carrying case\n-\tBluetooth 4.1 connectivity (one-touch pairing)\n-\tIncludes silicone and memory foam tips, fins, and clips so anyone and everyone can find a perfect fit with sublime comfort.\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a pair of Anker\u2019s Soundbuds Curve earphones, you can find them here on Anker\u2019s website, where you can buy them for $35.99 \u2013 shipping is not free.

The Vivo 8L is available today, the 24th of October 2017, and is available on Amazon for $199 MSRP, but you can grab one right now for $149. BLU is offering a limited-time only $50 discount, which makes the price of the phone much more appealing.Hands-On Review -\n \nThis is the third BLU device that I have reviewed, and each new model keeps getting better and better. Each iteration of their devices has improved on something, whether it\u2019s hardware, performance, quality control, and many other little areas that help to make the phones ship-shape, and enable them to deliver a consistent and reliable performance. The Vivo 8 is a well-made device and it has lots of appealing features that help set it aside from the competition, but the Vivo 8L takes that to another level in an entirely different price bracket. The Vivo 8L (the L stands for \u201clite\u201d) retains the flagship moniker \u201cVivo\u201d, but it trimmed a little around the belt and dropped the price, making an already affordable phone even more affordable. Where the trimming was done, there were carefully made decisions on hardware and implementation that really balanced out the device and make it run very well, and it looks sharp.Specs:\n- An Octa-core MediaTek 6753 processor (and Mali T720 GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 1.3ghz\n- 3GB of memory \n- a 5.3\u201d curved display, with 720x1280 HD resolution, made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (277ppi)\n- A 4,000 mAh battery\n- 32GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n- A 13MP f/2.0 aperture main camera with Sony IMX sensor and LED flash\n- A 20MP front-facing camera, with LED flash (fancy!)\n- Runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box\n- Bonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)\n- GSM UnlockedPricing: As I briefly mentioned above, the MSRP is $199, but BLU has partnered with Amazon for an exclusive limited-time sale price of $149. The device currently only comes in one color: Black.Overview and Performance:  The overall performance of the phone is solid. As soon as I fired up the Vivo 8L, I immediately started downloading a lot of my favorite apps and games to see how well they worked. I have to give a brief kudos here for the MediaTek 6753 processor, because I am very impressed with the performance, especially for a processor that\u2019s rated at 1.3ghz. The lower clock speed for this processor is part of the developmental strategy for the device though. The 1.3ghz processor, plus 3GB of RAM and a 720p display, is a combination for winning! The phone's battery life is rated for two days of use. I haven\u2019t tested that theory out yet because I always plug my phone in at night to ensure I have a full charge for the next day, but with mixed to moderate use, I can say that the device should last two days. You can\u2019t watch YouTube for 48hrs straight, but with normal, blended use, the battery life is fantastic! However, with this balanced package, the device does suffer on top-end speed and intensive multitasking, which is mostly limited by the RAM. With one or two apps open, the devices consistently hovers around 1.3-1.5GB of memory available, which fills up quickly. The best way I found to optimize performance is to actively manage what apps you have running in the background.Display: Overall, I have been very impressed with the graphics. The color saturation and sharpness are very good for a 720p screen, and the brightness is above average as well. I was initially disappointed when I opened the box and saw that it was only 720p, but the implementation is solid. 5.2\u201d is the optimum display size for 1080p resolution, so dropping down to 720p is not as harmful to the resolution or experience as it would be if the screen size were larger. As I used the device, the balance between the screen size and display ratio became very comfortable and I didn\u2019t really give it any extra thought after I started using the device. The additional benefit of the lower resolution is that it is less power consuming, which allows you to use your phone longer, and is less intensive on the processor!Battery Life: The battery life on this phone is phenomenal. The MediaTek 6753 is a very fuel efficient chipset. I\u2019ve hammered on the specs a few times already, in positive and negative ways, and the shiny ribbon that ties it all together is the battery life. This phone is built to last, and not only last, but give you a quality experience at the same time. Generally when a phone company is skimpy with specs, it\u2019s in the wrong areas and they end up sacrificing performance for aesthetics. However, when BLU decided to make the \u201clite\u201d version of the Vivo 8, they didn\u2019t skimp on performance, they balanced it. The battery life is great, and it\u2019s even further accented by the CPU and display ensemble that are paired well for performance, long life, and enjoyment! The phone also supports quick-charge and comes with a 5V/2A charger, which is still using USB 2.0.Fingerprint Sensor: The Fingerprint Sensor (FPS) on the Vivo 8L works well. Changing things up a little bit from the Vivo 8, BLU decided to position the FPS on the back of the phone this time, which is perfectly fine. The FPS is very responsive and doesn\u2019t have much of a delay when unlocking the phone. The only downside to the FPS is that it is slightly less forgiving than some other flagship phones that I have used, but again, I can\u2019t imagine many other devices that have a FPS for $149, much less one that works well. The accuracy and speed of the FPS isn\u2019t a problem. The only limiting factor is when it comes to partial prints and improper placement of the finger, which is more of an operator error issue than it is a function issue of the FPS, I\u2019ve just been spoiled by the iPhone and Note 8.Sound: The sound on the phone is very good, and the volume is pretty good as well. Another functional change for the Vivo 8L is that BLU decided to put their more traditional rear-firing speaker back on the device, which I am actually happy about. You will be able to see more of the reasons why I like it in my review video, but as I\u2019ve stated before in the BLU R1 HD review, the back-firing speaker works well because a) your hand doesn\u2019t cover it up when you\u2019re holding the device horizontally, and b) the speaker position takes advantage of the natural grip that you have on the phone and redirects the sound off your hand, helping reflect it back toward you for an enjoyable sound experience. Oh, and bonus\u2026. It has a 3.5mm jack, which also makes me a happy camper. This recent trend of no headphone jack and requiring a converter is for the birds, unless you are lucky enough to have Bluetooth everything for all your audio needs. If you\u2019re a person who still likes to jam out with your 2015/16 era headphones or uses an auxiliary cord, you will definitely appreciate that BLU held onto this feature in the Vivo 8L.Camera: The camera on this phone is the same 13MP camera and Sony imaging processor that\u2019s in the Vivo 8, which is pretty darn good for an economy level, unlocked phone. However, BLU decided to up their game even more with the Vivo 8L and bumped the front-facing selfie camera up to 20MP (yes\u2026 a 20MP selfie!) Also making an appearance on the Vivo 8L is the LED flash setup on the front-facing selfie camera, which allows you even more flexibility when trying to snap selfies in any environment. The interface incorporated the same gesture swiping for the camera interface as the Vivo 8, and went a step further and added tons of new features and camera modes, enabling you to take excellent photos in just about any climate or condition. One important thing that I\u2019d like to reinforce is that if you like filters, you are going to love this phone. BLU included tons of built-in features and filters straight into the camera interface, such as: professional mode, night time mode, slow motion, time-lapse, text recognition, HDR, and so much more. In fact, the camera natively defaults to HDR mode, which can be turned on/off, or left on Auto. I have definitely been impressed with the enhancements that were made to the camera suite, which is built into the camera this time and allows you to make adjustments on the fly and doesn\u2019t require an additional app to tweak the camera or add enhancements.Software: I am happy to report that the device comes with Android 7.0 Nougat, which was a welcome surprise, especially since other mainstream devices still don\u2019t have it. The inclusion of Android 7.0 in the Vivo 8 was a great step in the right direction, and it still works well for the 8L. I know a lot of people are starting to expect new devices to have Android Oreo on them now, but\u2026 this is a $149 phone and there are hardly any phones with Oreo on them presently, so I don\u2019t think there's anything wrong with choosing to launch with Nougat. BLU brought over many of the features and gestures from the Vivo 8, such as swiping from the bottom to get to the menu settings, and the top-down swipe is reserved for notifications only. The stock android experience isn\u2019t modified too much, but you will notice little enhancements or changes here and there. One feature that I really like on the Vivo 8L is that BLU incorporated Google Assistant into the interface, which you can access simply by swiping left from the home screen, much like Bixby on the Samsung 8/Note devices. Another feature that I like is you can unlock your phone with Google Assistant, simply by saying \u201cOk Google.\u201d Of course, it opens straight to Google Assistant, but I have found it helpful because I never really used Google Assistant before this phone. All in all, I think the software experience is improved over the Vivo 8, and I like the UI features that were added. It makes the phone feel almost like a cross between the iPhone and Android together, but it\u2019s done well \u2013 they even brought the app drawer back!Conclusion: All in all, the Vivo 8L is a fantastic phone. I have been very happy with it and I think that it\u2019s one heck of a catch for $149. It\u2019s more than adequate for day-to-day use, and it even allows for some moderate gaming, excellent pictures, and it\u2019s a great phone for someone who is heavily engaged in the social media scene. I have no hesitation in recommending this phone at all. The Vivo 8L is a great device that really balances price and performance, and is an excellent addition to the Vivo family. \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a Vivo 8L device, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 24 October 2017, with a limited-time sale price of $149 immediately available on launch. The normal price is going to be $199, but during the sale they are discounting it by $50, which is a fantastic deal.

The Look:  Once you get the Stowaway out of its well-secured packaging, the case is aesthetically pleasing and very well constructed. For being a unibody design, the case is rather bulky, and doesn\u2019t have much wiggle room, meaning it doesn\u2019t bend or flex very much. The case looks very sharp, and comes in several colors: Black, Deep Navy, Plum, and Sand. One of the great things about the color options and the design of this case is that it doesn\u2019t conflict with the color of your phone. Because the case covers the entire phone - minus the little porthole on the back for the camera and fingerprint sensor - you don\u2019t have to worry about limiting your color options to ones that pair well with your phone color. I really like the encapsulating design because many times I am worried about getting particular colors in phone cases because of the contrast issues, but the Stowaway case removes all of the worry when it comes to this issue and allows you to choose whatever color you want without fear of how it will look. I\u2019m very happy with the Deep Navy color that I have, and it looks fantastic paired with the S8+\u2019s dark screen when the display is off.The Feel: The surface texture of the case is really good. It isn\u2019t slick, but it has a unique feel to it that reflects the premium build quality, and makes it feel secure in your hand. Honestly, it feels kind of weird at first because it\u2019s almost like the surface feels velvety, but it\u2019s not. The only issue I have with the surface of the phone is that it seems to absorb oils and other residues rather easily and needs to be cleaned occasionally, unlike a hard-plastic or rubber style case. Other than that, the case feels great, looks great, and it does a great job providing solid protection for your phone. As I stated above, the case is rather rigid and bulky, which definitely obscures the form-factor of the device, which may or may not be a good thing. I like to keep the natural form factor intact, whenever possible \u2013 especially with the S8+ because it\u2019s such a sleek and gorgeous device. However, the compromise on the ergonomics of the device and bulkiness also gives you much more protection over a normal bumper style case, so the trade-off is justifiable, especially when it looks so darn good in the process. The cutouts and buttons work well on this case, and I am happy to report that I didn\u2019t have any problems at all with the power connector cutout digging into my finger, which is fantastic!Security: The Stowaway is rated at 6ft of drop protection, which is a little surprising considering the bulkiness of the case. I would have thought that it would be rated for at least 10ft, but 6ft is more than adequate. Think about it... if the average person is 5-6ft tall, how are you going to manage to drop your phone 10ft in day-to-day situations? It's not a very likely scenario. Finally, another safety feature built into the Stowaway is the chin of the case which hangs over the edge of the screen, keeping the display screen safe from surface contact if you decide to lay your phone face down on a normal, flat surface. The Stowaway Compartment: Another fancy feature of the case is the namesake \"stowaway\" card holder, which also doubles as a kickstand, and can hold up to three cards inside of it. The flap flips out and can be used as a kickstand, which seems to be a semi-popular feature with some of the recent cases I\u2019ve seen. Of course, you don\u2019t want to use the hatch for the card holder as a kickstand while your cards are in it\u2026 The card compartment is a nice addition to the case though, and Incipio even provides a film-style protector to put on the backside of your phone to protect it from any potential scratches or unwanted scuff marks from placing cards inside the case. The reason for this is because the compartment is open-backed, meaning there is no protective liner inside between the device and the cards \u2013 you can see this in the pictures.Conclusion: I am very pleased with this case and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a stylish case that provides comprehensive protection, and looks great. Normally I like my cases to be as minimalistic as possible, but with this device the added protection and design of the case just works. It\u2019s a pleasure to hold, and it\u2019s also convenient to be able to stow your driver\u2019s license, or credit card in the back, eliminating the need for a wallet. What\u2019s even better is the fact that the phone has Samsung Pay, which means you can even eliminate the credit cards if you\u2019re brave, and tote this case as a standalone payment method, and only carry your driver\u2019s license or a backup card.Pros: \n-\tProvides great protection and looks cool doing it\n-\tThe color options are nice, and don\u2019t clash with the device\n-\tThe stow and go capability for cards in the back is nice\n-\tThe case offers great security and features for the priceCons:\n-\tThe soft-touch surface picks up residues easily\n-\tThe form factor is definitely obscured by the case\n-\tThe price \u2013 it\u2019s not cheap, but it\u2019s definitely worth the price\n-\tIf you only have one or two cards in the compartment, they rattle around a little\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one of Incipio\u2019s new Stowaway cases, you can grab one over at their website for $34.99.

As part of the Android Central Community Review Team, I got the opportunity to review the RhinoShield Bumper Case for the OnePlus 5. I have been using this case for a month and here is my review.\nUnlike cases from other manufacturers, RhinoShield takes a unique approach to building its cases. What you get is just a bumper case without any back cover. \nWith the combination of soft and hard shell around the top, bottom and the edges, RhinoShield promises to provide drop protection of at least 11 feet/3.3 meters. The hexagonal structure in the case interior also helps to give that maximum protection. \nThe easiest way to install the case is to slide in from the top first and then the bottom. Once installed, the top and bottom feel firm. \nHere is how the front looks after installing the case.\nHere is how the back looks after installing the case.\nHowever, the sides feel a little flimsy. They are loose enough to pull. This does not happen with the top and the bottom. \nThat said, the sides do have a good grip so your OnePlus 5 won't accidentally slip from your hands. \nAnd if you plan to remove the case, you should know it's not that easy for good reasons, which again shows you that your OnePlus 5 is well protected in the case. To remove the case, slide out the top first and then the bottom. \nThe best thing about this case is that it has well-raised lips both on the front and the back so that it protects both your screen in the front and the camera in the back of your phone. \nThe cutouts for the buttons fit well and are easy to operate. I was able to use the alert slider without any difficulties. In fact, I found using the alert slider with the case easier to use than without the case. The volume buttons, on the other hand, might take a little time to get used to as you don't get any feedback and also due to the sides being flimsy, you will find it difficult to use initially.\nI love the bottom cutouts for the ports. The cutouts are raised and have good ample space so you can easily use the ports without any difficulties. \nOne other good thing about this case is that it works well with my screen protector. I am using the BIUZKO Full Coverage OnePlus 5 screen protector and have no issues using it with the bumper case. With this combination, you should get good protection for your OnePlus 5. If you use skins, like dBrand or Slickwraps, then you should be happy to know that the bumper case is compatible with those too.\nI am still getting used to using RhinoShield's bumper case full time, but so far I like it. You definitely need to build that trust with the bumper case especially when the back of the phone is exposed. I am still cautious when I place my phone down, especially in non-flat surfaces or rocks as it might scratch the back. \nThe only big thing I don't like about this case is how flimsy the sides are. I am hoping that's for a reason to give you that protection and absorb shock from drops, but I am not doing a drop test to prove that. \nIf you are looking for a simple light-weight protection for your OnePlus 5 along with the choice of your screen protector and back skin, then RhinoSheild CrashGuard Bumper Case is an excellent choice. If you are not comfortable with getting a screen protector or a back protection, it should still be OK but I wouldn't recommend using this case without that. \nYou can purchase the bumper case directly from RhinoShield's website for $24.99.\nLet us know what you think about the case!", "time": "10-06-2017 12:11 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6021582", "text": "Hi Bro,\nI too ve ordered a Rhinoshield Bumper case.

With its unique approach, RhinoShield offers products that promise to give you the complete protection you are looking for your phone. \nAs part of the Android Central Community Review team, I got the opportunity to review the RhinoShield products for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, and this is my review of the CrashGuard Bumper Case, 9H Tempered Glass Protector and the Back Protector for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.9H Tempered Glass Protector\nIf you are going to put a case, then you should start first by applying a screen protector to avoid any compatibility issues. That is exactly what I did with mine as well. RhinoShield offers two types screen protectors for the Note 8:\n1) Non edge to edge with black borders\n2) Non edge to edge with transparent borders\nYou get both in the pack so that you can choose what works best for you. The key difference between the two is that the black borders will cover the edges and thus may not be compatible with many of the cases while the transparent border protectors leave a portion of the edges uncovered and so its compatible with most of the cases. \nGiven that I review lots of accessories, I decided to go with the transparent border screen protector. Applying the screen protector was very easy. Just make sure you are aligning it properly with the display. Don't worry, if you make a mistake or do not align it properly, just take it out and do it again. I succeeded the second time and the adhesive was still good. \nThe first time I applied, I noticed a rainbow effect along the edges. RhinoShield mentions that in their website. However, when I applied it the second time, I firmly pressed along the edges to ensure its glued in properly and after few mins, I did not notice that rainbow effect. I would probably blame the misalignment for the rainbow effect rather than the adhesive as that seems to be the case with mine.\nSince its a tempered glass protector, you will need to apply more force than usual when you are using the display. If you have not used a tempered glass protector before, this could take a while for you to adjust. However, I did not find any issues using the display or S Pen with the screen protector. \nI did try the screen protector with the black border and it did not play nice with my Spigen Rugged clear case and even with the RhinoShield's own bumper case as the case was pushing the black border on the edges thus making it hard to use the display. You can choose this type if you plan to use your Note 8 without a case. \nI believe RhinoShield has done a great job with these screen protectors. It is rated for 9H hardness. And its resistant to scratch, grease, scrape, and other cosmetic damage to the screen providing you the ultimate protection you want for the display. \nI would highly recommend this tempered glass protector for your Note 8. You can purchase the screen protector for $29.99 from RhinoShield's website.CrashGuard Bumper Case\nIf you are familiar with RhinoShield's bumper cases, then you know what you are going to get with this bumper case for the Note 8. RhinoShield sticks to its unique design by providing protection to the key parts of the phone with its bumper case. Unlike the traditional cases, the bumper case does not cover the back of your phone and leaves it exposed while covering the top, bottom, and the sides.\nWith the combination of soft and hard shell around the top, bottom and the edges, RhinoShield promises to provide drop protection of at least 11 feet/3.3 meters. The hexagonal structure in the case interior also helps to give that maximum protection by absorbing maximum impact during the drops.\nThe easiest way to install the case is to slide in from the top first and then the bottom. \nAs you can see, the case works well with the transparent border screen protector. \nThe buttons on the sides are firm and you will need to press a little harder than usual to use them. Otherwise, they feel great.\nThe cutout for the ports and the S Pen are perfect. I did not find any issues using the ports or handling the S Pen. \nThe cutouts are raised well enough so they give good protection to the ports. \nThe case has raised lips both on the front and the back. However, I would still recommend using a screen protector to make sure you are protecting your display. \nYou can buy the bumper case from RhinoShield's webiste for $24.99.Transparent Back Protector\nThis is an interesting product. Given that the bumper case exposes the back of the phone, it makes sense to have some protection to the back if you wish to. That is exactly what the transparent back protector offers. \nIt took some time for me to apply as I found it hard to align with the camera and fingerprint cutouts. After few tries, I finally applied it. As the name suggests, it's completely transparent so you get to see your device's color.\nRhinoShield also promises that this protector protects the device's back from impacts. While the product description says its fingerprint resistant, I found that is not the case. As I used it more, I saw a lot of my fingerprint smudges in the back protector. Though a simple wipe will make it clean. \nThat said, I do find this protection useful as it protects the device's back from scratches that you normally get by placing your phone on different surfaces. That will be quite common when you use the bumper case as it exposes the device's back.\nOne thing to note is that the protector does not cover the back entirely and has some space along the top, bottom and the edges. Unclear why, but with a good case, this shouldn't be an issue. \nYou can buy the transparent back protection from RhinoShield's webiste for $19.99.Conclusion\nOverall, RhinoShield's Note 8 products are a good improvement over its S8 products as I found the S8 products rather mediocre and did not recommend them before. However, things are very different with the Note 8. I would highly recommend Note 8 products from RhinoShield especially if you decide to get all the three which is a great combination - the bumper case, tempered glass protector, and the transparent back protection.", "time": "10-13-2017 08:49 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6050955", "text": "Did you keep the back cover on?

With a 0.7mm tip and 4096 pressure points, S Pen helps you take notes or annotate images precisely with your Note 8. In the video below, I walk you through some of the top S Pen features for your Note 8. Screen off memo\nTo take a quick note when you display is off, just pop out your S Pen and start writing immediately on the screen. There is no need to unlock your phone. \nIt has also got few basic options such as selecting a pen thickness and pinning the note to Always on Display (AOD). Pinning the note to AOD will display the notes for 10 minutes after which it will collapse into an icon in your AOD.\nYou can also add multiple pages so you can capture different notes per page. Samsung allows you to add up to 100 pages.Air command\nAir command allows you to quickly access S Pen shortcuts whenever you remove your S Pen from your Note 8. The floating icon, which appears as soon as you pop out your S Pen, provides access to those S Pen shortcuts. You can add up to 10 shortcuts, including your installed apps.\nTo manage the shortcuts, go to:Settings -> Advanced Features -> S Pen -> Air commandSamsung Notes\nHere is another way to manage and take notes with your S Pen. To launch this shortcut, launch air command, and tap on Create notes. \nWith the S Pen Create note shortcut, you can quickly bring up the Samsung Notes popup and start taking notes. \nIf you want to continue using your phone but want to keep the notes pop up on screen, you can do so by minimizing the popup into a floating icon that you can move around anywhere on your screen. To get back to the notes, just tap on the icon again.Smart select\nWith the smart select S Pen shortcut, you can select a particular section of your screen, take a screenshot, annotate if needed and share them on social media or with your friends.To launch this shortcut, launch air command, and tap on Smart select. \nSmart select gives you the option to select the section based on shapes - Rectangle, Oval and Lasso. \nAs an added bonus, you can also quickly record GIFs using the smart select shortcut!Screen write\nScreen write shortcut allows you to take a screenshot and annotate it before saving. It is very handy if you want to mark up certain sections with shapes and text. Once saved, you can share the screenshot to your friends or social media. To launch this shortcut, launch air command and tap on Screen write. Glance\nWith the glance shortcut, you can quickly minimize the current app into a thumbnail so that it is available to glance later. You can hover your S Pen over the thumbnail to expand it.To launch this shortcut, launch air command, and tap on Glance.\nIt is useful in the instances where you want to compare certain items in two different apps. Yes, you could launch the multi-window mode but that would take up the screen real estate whereas, with the glance, it wouldn't.Live message\nThis is one of my favorite S Pen features. This allows you to create GIFs of your own by animating the content you write or draw on pictures. You can select a background, either a solid color or a picture, select the pen type from ink, glow & sparkle, pick a pen color and start writing or drawing on the background.To launch this shortcut, launch air command, and tap on Live message.\nOnce you are done, you can then save this as a GIF and share it with your friends or social media.Magnify\nWith the magnify shortcut, you can magnify areas of the screen as you hover your S Pen over those areas. You can magnify up to 300% so it comes in handy if you want to take a closer look at the high-quality images for example.To launch this shortcut, launch air command, and tap on Magnify.Translate\nWith the translate shortcut, you can translate words or sentences by just hovering your S Pen over those words or sentences. Using the translate settings bar at the top, you can switch between the modes - Word or Sentence - by tapping on the far left icon. To launch this shortcut, launch air command, and tap on Translate.\nWhen using the word mode, you can translate 36 languages into 71 languages, and when using the sentence mode, you can translate 39 languages into 71 languages. Using the settings bar at the top, you can select your source and target languages.Direct pen input\nInstead of typing with your keyboard, you can use your S Pen to write in the text fields in the apps. For example, if you hover your S Pen over the browser's address bar, you will get a small icon to enable the direct pen input. Tap on that icon to start writing with your S Pen.\nOnce you have completed writing, it will be converted to normal text. By tapping the Go button, it will perform the intended action, for example, navigating to that page in the case of the browser app.Selecting text\nWith the help of the S Pen button, you can easily select text in your screen or app. Just press and hold the S Pen button and then swipe to select your desired text. You will then get the options to copy, share or even look up the text in the dictionary. The options here could vary between apps as well. Air view\nMost of the Samsung apps, like the Samsung Notes, Messages, Email etc., support air view gestures where you can use your S Pen to perform some actions. \nWhen editing photos in the Samsung Gallery app, you can quickly select multiple photos by just dragging your S Pen across all photos. Very handy if you want to bulk edit or copy/move pictures. This multiple selection gesture work even in other Samsung apps like Samsung Notes. \nTo scroll down or up, you can hover your S Pen to the bottom or top of the page respectively and it will start scrolling down or up automatically. This also works in most of the Samsung apps.\nTo quickly get a preview of an item, like a photo or notes, you can just hover your S Pen over the item and it will give you a bigger thumbnail with few options like edit, delete and share straight away. Draw on pictures\nS Pen is a great tool for doodling or coloring or even sketching if you are into it. With its 0.7mm tip with 4096 pressure points and tilt sensitivity support, you can sketch or draw on pictures quite precisely.\nTo draw on a picture, just select your picture and tap on edit and then select the draw option. You can choose your desired pen type, thickness, and color to begin with. \nYou can download many coloring apps from the Play Store as well, but I would highly recommend Samsung's Penup app that you can download from the Galaxy Apps store.\nFor sketching, you got few options as well like the Sketchbook for Galaxy and Samsung Notes apps, both which you can download from the Galaxy Apps store.\nWhat's your favorite S Pen feature?

Established in 2011, Carved has been doing wonderful things with phone cases for both Android and Apple phones over the past few years, and it is their unique blend of creativity and product design that caught my eye.\nI was happy to receive two different cases from Carved as review units (the Puzzle Inlay and the Hexagon Inlay). I think the thing that most intrigued me with their cases is the different stylings and colors of their simple, yet appealing designs. If you are familiar with my previous review of the #WoodBack case by Cover-Up, then you know that I\u2019m a fan of wooden cases. If you haven\u2019t read it --- here\u2019s the link: https://forums.imore.com/community-r...ne-7-plus.html - and, for the record, I like wooden cases. However, the Carved cases that I received are a bit of a departure from the previous wooden case that I owned. The Puzzle Inlay and the Hexagon Inlay are colorful, they\u2019re sharp, and they really stand out in the crowd because of their uniqueness. Each piece of the inlay is laser-crafted with meticulous detail, and looks fantastic.The Look: First off, there are many different looks and styles when it comes to Carved. The two that I received are the Puzzle Inlay and the Hexagon Inlay, but they have a various assortment of other designs that will appeal to just about anyone\u2019s fancy. The box that the cases comes in is simple and reminds me of something that came out of highlights magazine (I\u2019m dating myself a little bit here.) Each box comes with the same crafty little design with various animals and objects that show a transition from the tree tops, to bustling city life, all the way down to the roots, which I think is a little representative of the appeal and design of the cases. The cases have a modern hard rubber feel that shines, feels sturdy in your hand and provides adequate protection, but the styling is as varied and works well for dressing your phone for work, or going out to a quaint country diner for lunch. The wood work that is done with each case is also fantastic. Carved offers traditional wooden cases in different types of wood, and they also mix things up with their inlaid, colorful pieces of carved wood that create fancy patterns and designs on the back. The two styles that I received are actually the models that I chose, because I really liked the designs! The Feel: The sides of the phone are texturized, for added grip and control over the case. The overall physique of the case is fairly slim and doesn\u2019t hide the slender form factor of either the iPhone 7+ or the Galaxy S8+. When you are holding the phone, it feels secure, and it\u2019s not something you have to worry about dropping. There are cut-outs on the bottom of the case that give you access to all of the important stuff, such as the charging port, speaker, and 3.5mm headphone jack (if applicable). Speaking of ports, they are easy to access and you will have no problem connecting your charging cable, but I did find that the opening for the charging port tended to dig into my finger a bit after a while. Of course, your mileage may vary based on the phone model that you are using, hand size, and the way that you hold the phone. Unfortunately for me my BlackBerry carrying habits have carried over to all of my devices and I use my pinkie finger as a bit of a cradle under the phone when I hold it, so this is prone to happen to me with many cases \u2013 it\u2019s definitely not a deal breaker, but something to be aware of. The only other issue that I have with the phone case is the buttons for the power button, but more so for the volume rocker and dedicated Bixby button on the Galaxy S8/8+ case. Because the buttons are flat and infinitesimally textured, it is near impossible to figure out whether you\u2019re hitting the volume down button or the Bixby button when you first get the case, and it carries over once you build up some muscle memory as well. Moving forward, I would really like to see either cut-outs for the buttons, or some form of demarcation or indentation that clearly signals which button you\u2019re pressing. This isn\u2019t so much of an issue on the Apple series phones, but it\u2019s quite frustrating when using the S8/S8+.Security: The overall protection for the device is good for everyday life. It\u2019s not an enclosed case and it doesn\u2019t offer any form of water protection for your device, so I would avoid taking it for a swim or casually dropping it into any body of water. The cases are not MIL-SPEC drop rated, but it\u2019s not really a concern for this case because it\u2019s built well, and it\u2019s a fancy wooden case \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly designed for being tossed around in a gym bag or for using as a coaster while out at dinner. The Carved case is a very well-constructed and eye-catching case that is worth showing off, and will protect your device well from small drops and accidentally knocking it off the coffee table. However, as is par for the course, make sure you put a glass screen protector on your phone! Really, we\u2019re talking about $700-900 phones here (brand new price). If you\u2019re going to go through the trouble of putting a case on it, be a caring phone owner and spend the $10 on Amazon and get a screen protector to pair with the case \u2013 you\u2019ll thank me later. So, the moral of the story is that the case will protect your phone well for day-to-day life.Conclusion: I love these cases. Having used one of Carved\u2019s cases for both my iPhone 7+ and my Galaxy S8+, I am really happy with the handling and appearance of the case. Like I said, I was sold from day one as soon as I saw the cool in-laid wooden designs on the back, and I wanted to give them a whirl on my phones. As much as these cases feel like they are combining Mother Nature with modern tech, it\u2019s not overly earthy; it\u2019s just a clever blend of awesome. I have received many compliments on both of my cases, and I have been more than happy with both of them. So, if you are interested in trying something new and want a case that represents a little bit of your inner appeal to carefully designed wooden cases and looks stylish, I\u2019d definitely recommend giving a Carved case a whirl.Pros:\n-\tThe unique designs and finely crafted details\n-\tThere is a wide selection of designs to choose from\n-\tSolid construction! Made well and built to impress \u2013 uses responsibly harvested wood!\n-\tProvides ample protection without compromising on designCons:\n-\tThe price (they aren\u2019t cheap) \u2013 cases start at $24.00 and go up \n-\tThe volume and Bixby button covers are flat and difficult to press accurately\n-\tThe cut-out on the bottom for the charging port can be uncomfortable\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one of Carved\u2019s cases for your phone, you can check them out over at their online store at: https://www.etsy.com/shop/carvedprod...er_title_items - they offer free first-class shipping in the U.S. Carved\u2019s cases are available for the iPhone 5S/SE/6/7/8, Plus series devices, Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, and the Galaxy S7, S8, and the S7+/8+.

I have been using this case for a month now and here is my review.\nThere are many things to like about this case starting with its leather trim that gives a soft and comfortable grip to your hands. The moment you pick this case up, you know you are going to enjoy that leather finish. \nWhile the outer layer is beautifully crafted with leather, the inner layer where your phone rests uses a fabric material that is soft and ensures your S8's glass back panel is well protected in the case. The overall design of the case feels strong and firm and yet it doesn't weigh a ton. \nIt was easy and simple to slide my S8 into the case. No problems there. I usually slide the bottom first and then slide the top & pop it in.\nThis is one of the few cases that fits well exactly with the phone's design. The case blends nicely with the S8's curved design which many cases fail to do so. I applaud Tech21 for putting more effort in helping users feel the original design, though the phone sits inside the case.\nTech21 promises up to 3m/10ft drop protection. Thanks to its unique 3-layer design - a flexible outer shell, a skeletal frame and the shock absorbent FlexShock layer that runs along the sides - the case is able to absorb the maximum impact during drops and give you that protection you are looking for. Fear not, this doesn't add any additional weight to the case.\nThe case has precise cutouts for the ports with a raised maximum thickness that is only going to protect those ports from accidental drops. There is ample space around the ports that make it easy to reach as well. \nI love the camera and fingerprint sensor cutouts. They are raised very well to protect from surfaces and accidental drops. \nThe front of the case has raised lips at the top and the bottom. The lip on the sides are not raised well but just enough so it can offer little protection and still provide space for the S8's edge functionalities. I would still recommend putting a screen protector if you are worried about the display. \nButtons are firm, very firm that you need to press them hard. This is the one thing I do not like about this case. I do use the buttons often, be it the power button or the volume buttons, and I found it annoying and frustrating that I need to press them harder. \nWait, there is more! \nThe Evo Go comes with a concealed card storage that can store up to 2 cards. It is designed such that it is impossible to locate this card storage at first glance. In fact, you could completely miss it if you didn't know about its existence! \nThe concealed card storage with magnetic closure, though it is advertised to hold up to 2 cards, I found it hard with 2 cards as it gets hard to pull out the cards. Instead, it worked great with just 1 card. You can easily fit two cards, it is just that it might not be that easy to take them out. \nI did not have issues with Samsung Pay. Depending on the cards you store in the concealed storage, it may or may not affect Samsung Pay. For example, if your card is NFC enabled, then you will have issues when you use Samsung Pay. No issues with the magnetic closure either. \nSomething to be aware of that the more you use the concealed storage, it leaves a mark just below the camera cutout.\nI have really enjoyed my time using this case, except for those firm buttons on the side. If you are looking for a good protection with real leather trim and a concealed card storage as an added bonus, then Tech21 Evo Go case is for you! It does come with a hefty price tag of $69.95 though. I am quite sure there are other alternatives that you can choose, but if you do choose this case, you will not be disappointed. \nYou can purchase this case directly from Tech21's website in Orchid Pink and Black colors. \nLet me know what you think about the case and if you are already using one, leave your thoughts as well.", "time": "09-17-2017 01:16 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "LG G6 Titanium Review", "thread": [{"postID": "post5978380", "text": "I got to test the LG G6 for a month and wow, what a phone!\nFor over a year now, due to my job, I've been fiddling with many phones. (like the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and the S7, to cite a few). The Note 5 used to be my media watcher for all things Netflix and Youtube on a regular basis (prior to my iPhone 7 Plus purchase, back in April) as well as being my note taking and game playing device. But when I'm on the go and pocket size is limited (or non-existent for us gals), I'll happily switch over to a smaller form factor phone for the convenience and 1-handed operation. But what if I could have my cake and eat it too?\nEnter, the LG G6. The best way to describe this phone, is to call it versatile. What else can I call a product that finally gives me all the things I want in one package without being bogged down by unnecessary fluff and is easy to use?\nThe way LG did this was by reducing the bezel size a LOT resulting in an almost 80% screen-to-body ratio, alongside a PERFECT side grip which feels great for a product this size. The glass back has become almost unanimous in the industry on high end phones so it stands to reason that the G6 has this as well, much to everyone's chagrin (and fingerprints). But the flat display with beautiful curves makes it a cinch to hold in my hands. The thickness of the phone itself is also a factor in how you hold it and how firmly it is to be held in your grasp. Design-wise, it's +1 for LG. My small hands appreciated, as the phone isn't slippery at all.\nSpec wise, it's another story. Many users feel that LG should have waited for the Snapdragon 835 instead of using the Snapdragon 821 but in reality, this has in no way impacted my daily intensive usage of the device. The G6 is also paired with 4GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage which is a bit disappointing considering the other offerings such as the One Plus 3T which costs a lot less then the G6 . Thankfully, it does has expendable storage via micro-SD card which is must for a lot of users now, especially media consumers.\nMy favorite thing about the phone has got to be the 5.7 inch QHD 2880x14400 display, even if it isn't Samsung's level of OLED technology. But that doesn't make it any less good especially since it's capable of HDR 10 which is available in some Netflix shows. But, the non-standard aspect ratio will be a -1 for people who love to have their content on the entire screen, such as Youtube videos, which doesn't currently support this, resulting in black bars on either side. Another thing to note is the return of the Always On Display feature which I found myself missing from my short stint with the Galaxy S7. As a girl who doesn't wear watches (yet!), I found this to be particularly useful for the time and notifications. It does use up more power then Samsung's implementation but I haven't noticed it drain my battery in any impactful way.\nRunning on Android's 7.0 Nougat operating system, the user interface works wonders for split view mode, which once again, seems to play along very well with this aspect ratio. It's not stock Android by any means, but it's barebones enough that you will never feel like LG has crammed a ton of unnecessary things to bloat the user experience. In fact, it's down right enjoyable. Phone calls were great and clear but the bottom firing speaker is easily the worse crime commited here. There was a huge opportunity to have made this a great media consumption device but as soon as you pump up the volume any higher then 50%, the sound quality takes a serious nose dive. Yes, the headphone jack is still present!\nSo now we come to the greatest plight of the modern cell phone user: the battery life. In short, it's... adequate. With a 3300mAh battery, at half illumination and moderate use, I could barely get through the day (I must admit, I did game a lot, though). There are battery saving modes that do help you last a lot longer on a single charge, but if you plan on using this device for long periods of time, think about bringing a battery pack with you. It's a good thing that the G6 also comes Quick Charge 3.0 and wireless charging to help you manage throughout the day. Just don't forget that the G6 uses a USB-C connector instead of Micro-USB so you won't have your device die on you like I did...\nWhere I would give another passing grade to the G6 is to it's camera. LG has always had decent cameras in the past, all the way to my short experience with the LG G3. But this time around, the G6 comes with a dual camera system with 13 megapixel sensors, sporting a f1.8 aperture with a 70 degree field of view (and OIS) and the other with an f2.4 aperture with a 125 degree field of view respectively. This gives the us an illusion of an optical zoom but instead of getting closer to a subject, it allows you to be farther away. This makes the G6 a great shooter for things like large buildings and places where you just can't get close enough or far enough away from to get that perfect shot. The 5MP front camera also sports a wide angle mode which is a welcome feature for those lovely group shots. \nIn conclusion, my time with the G6 has made me rethink my future Android phone (as a business phone, that is. My iPhone will always have a special place as a daily driver), despite some minors annoyances, such as the lock screen button on the back, doubling as the finger print sensor which made me swear quite a few times despite resting my finger on it perfectly. I do wish that LG offered a white variant of the G6 but the Titanium version is as close as we'll ever get. The camera area being almost flat with the base of the back means that the lense can be easily scratched with small bits of dust. So grab yourself a case! And finally, software suppport for this aspect ratio is still lacking, resulting in wasted space for most of your favorite apps, despite the compatiblity mode that is offered but that is hit or miss at best.\nBut those are minor gripes for an undoubtedly elegant and again, versatile phone. It's a great shooter, a handy user and the QHD IPS display will make you... a happy viewer.\nThank you for reading.", "time": "09-16-2017 01:22 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5980222", "text": "Excellent, well balanced review!

Ringke has been in the business of making cases for quite a while now, and their new models for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 are definitely up-to-par with the rest of the phone models that they support. In anticipation of Samsung's new Galaxy Note 8, Ringke has released new versions of their popular Fusion, Air Prism and Onyx series cases. All three of these case models have been around for a little bit now, with the Air Prism being the most recent edition. So, if you're on the fence about what case to get for your device before it arrives, or generally just looking for something fresh and inexpensive to make a fashion statement, take a few minutes to see what Ringke has to offer!Ringke Fusion:\nI have had the pleasure of reviewing the Ringke Fusion previously for the BlackBerry KEYone, and the same winning qualities from the previous model have transferred over to the new Note 8 model. The Fusion series is a NGP style, clear-backed case that allows you to keep your phone safe with it's built-in smoked or clear colored bumpers. The clear-backed feature is especially clever because it allows you the ability to give the world an unimpeded view of the fancy colors and detail of your new phone, without having to compromise on safety - which is especially important considering the price tag associated with the device! In addition to looking stylish, the Fusion case is the only one of the three listed here that offers MIL-STD 810G - 516.6 Certified Military Grade Drop Protection! You can pick up the Fusion case in three colors: Clear, Smoke Crystal, and Rose Gold Crystal. The case is currently on sale for $9.99 through Amazon.com, and it's eligible for Prime free 2-day shipping.Ringke Onyx:\nThe Onyx series has been around for a little while now, and I have owned one previously for my iPhone 7+. I have been a big fan of Ringke for a long time. I used them almost exclusively for several years and relyed on the Ringke Slim style cases to keep my phone protected. I am big on maintaining the natural form factor of my devices, but at the same time I like to keep them protected, and looking good. The Onyx colored case does an excellent job in providing a simple, yet refined exterior, with the lined texture variations on the back and the carbon-fiber'esque diagonal lines on the top and bottom of the case backing. The case is only available in Black, and is currently on sale for $6.99 through Amazon.com, and it's eligible for Prime free 2-day shipping.Ringke Air Prism:\nIf you fancy something a bit more glittery and translucent for your phone case, the Prism series may be just what you're looking for. The Ringke Air Prism style case is relatively new and comes in various colors: Clear, Glitter Clear, Glitter Gray, Ink Black, Rose Gold Crystal, and Smoke Black. Each color creates its own unique color and sparkly look for your Note 8, especially if you keep the included Holographic Iridescent Deco film sheet inside the case, adding an additional letter of fabulousness to your phone's exterior. The film is included in the package and is optional; it gives you the option between glitter, and glitter sparkle max! So... if you're interested in keeping your phone safe, fancy, and want to show off your inner-sparkle vicariously through your phone, this is definitely worth taking a look at! The Ringke Air Prism is currently on sale for $7.99 - $12.99 (depending on color selection) through Amazon.com, and it's eligible for Prime free 2-day shipping.Conclusion: All three of these cases and the other various cases that Ringke offers for the Note 8, are well-priced, and the styles are varied enough to appeal to a wide audience.

If Earphones are what you\u2019re looking for and you don\u2019t want to fork out $100+ for Bose, Beats, or JBL, I\u2019m here to reassure you that you won\u2019t be left on the street corner for lack of options. Sure, notoriety goes a long way when you wear your earphones or headphones out in public, but everyone is different and so are their audio needs, which is where Anker comes in. I think the best way that I can describe Anker\u2019s Bluetooth SoundBuds Sport, is by referring to them as the Swiss Army Knife of earphones. Why do I say this? Well\u2026 take a look at the picture below. I personally own a pair of Bose SoundSport earphones and they definitely didn\u2019t come with near as many accessories or ways to make the experience more comfortable, or versatile. What does it come with? \n-\tTwo sets of ear molds (inner ear and outer ear)\n- Three soft rubber inner ear molds (S/M/L)\n-\t3 sets of ear tips (S/M/L)\n-\tA carrying pouch\n-\tCharging Cable (no charger base)Sound Quality: I am no certified audiophile, but I have been around the block a few times in my life. I have been an avid mobile and portable audio guy since my first Walkman when I was a kid, back when headphones all had orange or black fuzzy covers over them and nobody really talked about sound quality. Since the late 80\u2019s/Early 90\u2019s, technology has come a long way, and so have people\u2019s expectations for the quality of products that they buy, and the value associated with them. As far as sound quality goes with the SoundBuds, don\u2019t walk into it with the expectation that you\u2019re going to be getting Bose quality sound. I don\u2019t want to dissuade you from buying them, I just don\u2019t want to set false expectations. The sound quality for the SoundBuds is more than adequate, especially at the price range. For a short price comparison, the Bose SoundSport earphones run about $150, whereas the Anker SoundBuds are available for $29.99 through Anker (TL;DR that\u2019s a $120 difference). Building off of this, I think the SoundBuds are a great deal at $29.99. Here\u2019s my breakdown of the individual areas:-\tLow, Mid, and Highs, and Volumeo\tLows: Baseline lows are underrepresented in these earphones, but it can be enhanced through bass boosters and software mixers that allow you to adjust the levels. After some adjustments in my Napster equalizer (yes... I actually pay for Napster, lol) I was able to get adequate amounts of bass out of them, but it certainly wasn\u2019t impressive.\no\tMids: Mids, especially vocals, were very good for the volume. Voices do come off a little nasally at times, which can be off-putting if you\u2019re adjusting from high end earphones that produce natural vocals more effectively. These earphones are good at producing sound at the levels you want to hear while you\u2019re doing outdoor and exercise related activities, which are vocals and highs. As other sounds are dulled out by gym speakers or the methodical thud of the treadmill, you won\u2019t be perching your ears to try and hear the song lyrics. \no\tHighs: Highs are overproduced, and really accentuated. I\u2019m not sure whether this is artificially enhanced or designed by Anker, but if you have sensitive ears you will definitely want to adjust the mixer on your device to lower the highs a little bit, otherwise it can quickly wear on your ears. The overall sound is also a bit tinny, and feels forced. I know I\u2019ve mentioned this already, but having a way to adjust the equalizer is really how you\u2019re going to get the best sounding audio out of these earphones.\no\tVolume: The volume was a little lower than I\u2019d like. The overall spectrum of the sound is much more noticeable as the volume increases, and I feel like the power behind the drivers in these earphones is cut just short of ideal when it comes to max audio output. It\u2019s never good to listen to your earphones with the volume cranked up to 100% for a very long period of time, but 100% in these earphones just felt a little lacking. however, I\u2019ve also spent the last 16 years working around airplanes and firearms, so my hearing definitely isn\u2019t an accurate sample of the overall population.Functionality: The overall functionality of the earphones is solid. It\u2019s simple, yet it works really well, which is another one of the reasons I really like them. Unlike my Bose earphones which required the user instructions once or twice to figure something out, Anker makes life easy. All you have to do to connect them is turn them on and connect via Bluetooth. The pairing process isn\u2019t difficult. Turn the earphones on, open up your Bluetooth menu and as soon as you see them pop up, click on them to connect \u2013 that\u2019s all you have to do! There aren't any extra buttons you have to press, no magic words, just click-it, and get ready to listen to some tunes. There are no saved profiles and the only way you can connect to a different device is to disconnect the currently connected device to free the earphones up so you can reconnect with a different device. If you turn the earphones off, when you turn them back on it will attempt to reconnect to the last device it was paired with. The rest of the mechanics of the earphones are pretty straightforward. The earphones have volume up/down buttons on the side of one earbud, and the power on/off button on the opposite earbud, as well as the charging port (which is USB 2.0). In addition to that, they are rocking Bluetooth 4.0 compatibility which boasts a listening range of 66ft, and rated at 8 hours of listening time.Comfortability: This is where the Anker SoundBuds Sport really won some extra points with me. I don\u2019t have the largest ears in the world so trying to use stock earphones that come with phones has been a tremendous no-go for me for years, dating all the way back to the earphones that came with my original Game Boy. They fall out, they don\u2019t rest in my ear properly, they hurt, and generally they don\u2019t sound that great. Opening up the Anker SoundBuds and seeing all of the different ear tips and apparatuses to help me wear them comfortably was a big plus! In addition to that, it is designed to suit many different fancies, offering the inner-ear moldings so you can support them inside the ear, and the hard plastic molding in case you want to wear them on the outside/over-the-ear \u2013 this is one of the reasons I call them the Swiss Army of Earphones. Conclusion: For $29.99 or less, these are pound-for-pound, a great set of earphones that won\u2019t disappoint. The Anker SoundBuds Sport don\u2019t take home any blue ribbons or gold medals in any particular area other than ease of use, but for pricing, versatility and overall performance, they are hard to beat. I know that earphones can be an expensive investment and it\u2019s hard to make a decision, especially when you can\u2019t try them out at the store. Seriously\u2026 how are you supposed to buy a $150 pair of earphones without ever getting to listen to them? How are you supposed to know which is better, or whether the $150 pair of earphones is really better than the $99 pair, or even the $30 pair\u2026 it\u2019s daunting, and not cool. Having said all of that and placing it in context, a $29 investment on a versatile set of earphones is hardly a bad decision, and it\u2019s certainly one that\u2019s easier to make. \nIf you\u2019re interested in Anker\u2019s SoundBuds Sport earphones, you can check them out over at https://anker.com.

Bringing the best of both worlds under the same roof, Silk has published a mission statement and coined the word \u201csmartish\u201d, to describe their style and angle for marketing their brand.\u201cOur team is based in Austin, Texas, and has strong opinions on phone cases, tacos, and live music. We are a jaunty, down-to-earth, and highly-caffeinated group of folks that, since 2009, have taken our products seriously, but ourselves \u2026 not so much.\u201d\n\u201cSmartish products? Yeah, you read that right. Our products are just clever enough to make your everyday life a little better, but admittedly they won\u2019t teach you Kung Fu \u2026 yet. That\u2019s what we call smartish.\u201d\nSilk\u2019s mantra, as mentioned above, is \u201csmartish\u201d, which I think is a good word to segue into their new adoption, the Q Card case for the Samsung Galaxy S8/8+ (also for the iPhone 7/7+). Honestly, when I first took the Q Card case out of the box, I thought the design was a bit odd, and thought the designers were even more odd, which quickly turned into an appreciation for the neatness and utility-ness (I might as well make up words as well) that the Q Card case brings to the table. The Look: The Q Card case looks top-notch! My initial impressions of the design were definitely not matched with how impressed I was with the quality and seamless blending of materials. The Q Card case incorporates a pouch on the back of the case, which is inlaid into the case itself, allowing for a flush mounted card holder when a credit card/ID card is inserted into it (it feels a bit off if there isn\u2019t anything in the pouch) Silk claims that you can place up to three cards and some cash into the pouch, which I think tests the limits of the material, but placing one or two cards into the pouch is quite effective, and the cards are held securely in place. In addition to being a card carrier, the Q Card can use one of those cards you\u2019re toting around as a stand, enabling you to prop the phone up for video watching. Just above the card pouch on the backside of the case, there is a groove just larger than a standard-sized card that you can wedge one of your cards into to create the base for the case stand (it\u2019s fairly nifty). The rest of the case has a very sharp appearance, appealing to my inner professional stylings, meaning I think that this case would look very fancy tucked away inside of a suit pocket, or stowed away in some slacks. The Q Card case only comes in Onyx Black for the S8/8+, but it does come in four different colors for the iPhone 7/7+: Black Onyx, Gunmetal Gray, Champagne Gold, and Rose Gold. The Feel: The overall feel of the device is very nice. I think the best way that I can describe the design is simple, yet elegant. The blending of the hard rubber material, and the incorporation of the pouch on the backside is done very well. At first, the form factor was a bit off-putting, but that was mostly because it felt awkward to me with the cut-out area around the pouch, which is supposed to be holding a card of some sort. When you insert a card or two into the pouch, it fills out the area nicely and doesn\u2019t feel like something is missing when you\u2019re holding the case. However, I can say that after a day or two of carrying the case without any cards in it, it isn\u2019t really anything I pay attention to anymore. Honestly, one of the hardest parts about doing reviews is forcing yourself outside of your comfort zone and trying different things that you aren\u2019t normally disposed to purchase, and then giving an objective opinion on the product \u2013 this case has been one such instance for me. Normally I\u2019m not too keen on the idea of being \u201cexposed\u201d, for a lack of better words when it comes to carrying around my personal belongings, i.e., leaving the wallet at home and tossing a credit card in my phone case. I must say though that after using the Q Card case as it was intended and actually putting my ID and debit card in it, it\u2019s very liberating being able to walk out of the house and not have to worry about toting around my wallet. In fact, it\u2019s really something I have been wanting to give a whirl ever since I finally adopted Samsung Pay and fell in love with it. I still have the occasional failure when attempting to use Samsung Pay, and in those instances it\u2019s very important to have a backup method of payment, which is why you can\u2019t really ditch your wallet. Well, the Q Card really comes in handy for further untethering yourself from the social norm of carrying around a wallet and allows you to stow away your ID card, and a choice credit/debit card or two for when you need one. So\u2026 in fairness, you really have to give it a whirl to really appreciate all that the Q Card brings to the table. Protection: The overall protection on this phone case is surprisingly good. The hard rubber material protects the phone really well from potential slips and drops, and one security feature that I really like is the lip of the case that protects the surface of the phone. One area that many other cases have failed in for the Galaxy S8/8+ series, is screen protection. From cases to screen protectors, the curved edges of the infinity screen have caused infinite headaches for designers and owners both, in attempting to secure the screen in a realistic and meaningful way. Well folks, I\u2019m happy to say that the Q Card case has brought a little bit of their smartish ingenuity to the table and found a way for you to place your phone face-down on a normal surface without compromising the integrity of the screen, or having to create a cumbersome case to do it. The edges of the case are recessed, which gives you full access to the screen, yet the lip on the top and bottom of the screen protrude just enough to keep the screen lifted off of flat surfaces which allows you to safely place your phone down, face-down (+2 to smartish) Overall: This case is great for day-to-day use, it looks professional, and provides better than average protection for your phone without having to jump into the impact-resistant category. For the price, it\u2019s fantastic. The materials that were used to create the Q Card case are premium quality, and really make you feel like you\u2019re using a case that compliments the flagship status of your phone without breaking the bank. It works well if you\u2019re not carrying around cards in it, but it helps take you to the next level of minimalism and efficiency when you use it as it\u2019s designed and stow a card or two into the pouch. This case is a solid buy for just about anyone.\nPros:\n-\tStow-and-Go option with the built-in pouch for cards/cash\n-\tProvides solid protection even though it\u2019s not a protective style case\n-\tPremium build quality and intuitive design\n-\tFull access to the screen without sacrificing on aesthetics or protection\nCons: \n-\tThe card kickstand works, just don\u2019t forget to put your card back in when you\u2019re done\n-\tOnly comes in Black for the S8/8+\n-\tIt\u2019s not overly expensive, but it isn\u2019t cheap either\n-\tI give up\u2026 I\u2019m having to look for things that I don\u2019t like about the case at this point\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one of the Q Card cases, head on over to Silk\u2019s new website at: https://silksmartish.com.

We create innovative products that simplify your life through unique functionality. These products are designed to drive value, both in price and in your daily life.\nIt\u2019s always an exciting day for me when I get to try out a new phone case, especially when it\u2019s an up-and-coming manufacturer breaking its way into the phone accessory scene. For this review, I\u2019m covering the new Base Grip Slim Case, by Silk Innovations. Silk Innovations is a company based out of Austin, Tx (Go Texas!), and they make a pretty decent assortment of cases for both Samsung and Apple devices. Not only do they support several different models, they have multiple designs as well, ranging from minimalistic cases to more protective styles.The Look: Straight out of the box, I was really impressed with the color of the case. The Base Grip Slim Case comes in two different colors: Black, and Blue Jade. The case that I received is the Blue Jade color, and I like it a lot. I tend to shy away from more brightly colored cases, but for my Coral Blue S8+, the blue color wasn\u2019t too much of a stretch for me to try it out. The presentation of the case is impressive for a sub-$12 case. I don\u2019t usually associate this level of quality unless it\u2019s something I find on a \u201cdeals\u201d website, such as our very own Thrifter, or SlickDeals.net. Also, the packaging is simple and easy to get open, which I like (no pry bars or broken nails in the process!). Keep in mind, simple does not always mean cheap, or bad. Getting back to the design of the phone, the contours on the back of the case almost remind me of OtterBox with its defined outline and material shift on the backside of the case. The slight contouring blends very well with the overall material, and it isn\u2019t a hard-plastic style cover so it doesn\u2019t interrupt the smoothness of the design or scratch easily.The Feel: The first thing you will probably notice when you take the case out of the box is that the material feels pliable, which is apparent when trying to install the case. One of the big selling points for some of the new Surface notebooks now is that you can open the screen with only one hand (which is amazing\u2026 and I want one). The reason I draw this comparison is because you can install the Base Grip case onto the device with only one hand as well, which is more alarming than it is convenient. The rigidity of the material and seal of the phone is a bit suspect, and I have had the corner slip off of my phone once, which I can't say is entirely the cases fault. When the corner of the case came off of my phone it was in my cargo pocket while I was out doing some fairly intensive work which required me to climb in and out of vehicles - emphasis on climb. However, the case has very good grip on the edges, and the rest of the surface is not very slippery, which is a plus (great job, Silk). In addition to the styling and the way the case fits onto the phone, the overall design is a little scaled back from other case models that I have used on my S8+. What does this mean? Well, the case doesn\u2019t wrap very far around the front of the phone, which means that there is no overlapping bezel or screen buffer if you want to place your phone face-down on any surface. Additionally, it seems to make the case fit less securely on the phone, as was noted in my initial concern (less case, less to hold onto).Security: Just to get this out of the way, the case doesn't provide very much security for drops. If I had to give a comparison, I'd say the level of protection is better than a Peel case, and about on par with other slim/thin style cases. As noted, the snugness of the case on the phone is less than my usual preference, and the lack of overlapping support for screen protection leaves me with a few concerns as well. However, this case isn\u2019t designed to be a hefty, bulky, security blanket that will protect your phone from unforeseeable events of destruction. This phone case is designed to protect the sides of the phone, using its integrated air cushion and bumper support, as well as providing a physical barrier to the phone from scratches, keys, and normal every day surface abrasion hazards \u2013 it\u2019s a minimalist case lovers dream. For all that I said that about the case that was worrisome in the previous section, in this section, I actually like most of it. I love to keep my phone and its form factor as natural as possible, meaning it\u2019s not blocky, boxy, and morphed into a tank-like box with an LCD screen attached to it. The Base Grip case checks several boxes for me in form factor, as well as texture, and usability. In addition, the case doesn\u2019t encroach onto the screen and risk messing up your screen protector, which was a huge problem with many early on cases. From day one, it was difficult enough to find a glass screen protector to fit, much less one that would work with a case on it. With the Base Grip model by Silk Innovation, you can put multiple styles of glass screen protectors on your phone and don\u2019t have to worry about the case getting in the way.\nFor anyone interested, this is the glass screen protector that I used on my S8+: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071W2YDTW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 - one great thing about this screen protector is that it comes with a tray accessory that clips onto the phone and makes it easy to install. FYI, the screen protector isn't on my phone right now because I fell asleep on my phone during the hurricane and it popped off... but I liked it enough that I ordered another.Conclusion: I really like it! It has many of the qualities that I look for in a minimalistic style case, and it still manages to provide just enough protection for those accidental slips and drops that you might encounter around the home or office. The case is not MIL-SPEC rated or guaranteed to protect your phone from 3ft+ drops, but it is adequate if it slides off the coffee table or night stand when you\u2019re trying to turn off your alarm clock. Again, the recessed design that leaves the screen more exposed is a concern, as is the lack of grip strength around the device, but so far they haven\u2019t been issues. The best way to mitigate this gap in protective coverage is to keep a glass screen protector on your phone, and monitor the integrity of the case. All in all I think it should be ok, but I have only had it for a short while so I can\u2019t say how it will hold up three to six months from now. Pros:\n-\tIt\u2019s lightweight, and really scores a lot of points for minimalistic style\n-\tThe price is great, ringing in at $11.99\n-\tThe grip on the phone and texture are very smooth, and enjoyable\n-\tThe air-cushioned bumpers provide incidental protection for the phoneCons:\n-\tThe recessed case material around the screen does not provide very good protection\n-\tThe case grip on the phone itself may become loose with time\n-\tIt\u2019s not overly protective, so you have to be careful with your device\n-\tLack of colors: only Black and Blue\u2026 I\u2019d like to see more colors to compliment the device\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking one up or taking a peek at Silk Innovations other case options, check out their website over at: Silk Innovation \u2013 The Base Grip Slim Case is currently priced at $11.99, and is available from Amazon.com (all of Silk Innovations case sales go through Amazon).

If you like minimalism and appreciate slim profiles, then you will fall in love instantly with the Peel case.\nIf you are looking for a protective case, be it soft or hard, then this Peel case review isn't for you.\nThe Peel case is just 0.35mm thick and is very light. Make sure you handle with care as you take it from the package. It nearly feels as light as a paper.\nAs you feel the case in your hand, you will start to appreciate its craftsmanship. The case is precisely cut to fit your device. No branding, just the case. That is what you get with Peel. \nPutting on the case is super easy. Just slide it in from the bottom and you are done. This particular Midnight Black blends nicely with the black bezels in the front. I quite like how well formed the case is. It's hard to tell you to have a case.\nLooking around the case, the ports have precise cutouts that blend nicely with the device. Again, no added bumps around the ports. \nOne thing I like about the case is that, even though it's super thin, they managed to get a slightly raised bump for the camera and sharp precise cutouts for the fingerprint sensor. The raised bumps give protection from any scratches from the surface and the sharp precise cutout makes it easier to locate the fingerprint sensor.\nHowever, the case doesn't protect your screen. It does not promise to as well. The top and bottom curves blend seamlessly with the curved S8's design.\nI have been using this case for nearly a month now and I love it. For once, you get a case that allows you to enjoy your smartphone's design without adding any bulk. Of course, this super thin case does not protect you from drops. I didn't expect it to. It did protect me from scratches or other dings I usually put my phone through on various table/flat surfaces. \nAfter its heavy use for a month, I could see some tiny hairline scratches on the case. Happy to see the case doing its job here - saving your phone's back surface from those scratches!\nThe more you use this case, you will come to appreciate the Samsung S8's design rather than the case's design. That is where the Peel excels. It's not about the case, it's about your phone. Quote from Peel:\nWhat if there was some middle ground: a case that protects you from bumps, scratches, and light drops, but doesn't ruin your device's aesthetic? That was the basis for creating Peel.\nYou can buy the case directly from Peel for $24.99 and is available in three colors: Midnight Black, Orchid Grey, and Arctic Silver.", "time": "09-02-2017 01:33 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "The Essential Phone: First Impressions", "thread": [{"postID": "post5951311", "text": "The Essential Phone is finally here! The phone is targeted towards pro-consumers and has all the bells and whistles when it comes to its internal specifications. With its stunning edge to edge display, the Essential Phone comes with one of the best displays in a smartphone.\nI just got my Essential phone delivered and below are my first impressions: \nEssential Phone is all about keeping things to the minimal - the essentials. You see this right from the moment you open the box. You get the bare essentials. \nYes, that means you have to make some compromises as well. Below are the Essential Phone Specifications:5.7\" QHD LTPS LCD Display4GB RAM128GB Storage3040 mAh BatteryAndroid 7.1.1\nAs you can see, the Essential Phone comes with top of the line specs though it lacks some essential, I mean, basic features that every other flagship smartphones come with:IP68 water and dust resistant ratingWireless ChargingHeadphone JackOIS support for the cameras\nThat said, you do get an innovative edge-to-edge full-screen display with no bezels and a Ceramic back panel with Titanium edges along the sides. This makes the Essential Phone stand out and breathes a new life into the smartphone design space.\nIf you are looking to find the Essential logo or any other text, then you will find none. The design is so simple and has no logos or whatsoever anywhere. Love it!\nThe Essential Phone's main camera features a dual lens, each 13 MP. Using this dual lens, Essential combines the output of both to create stunning monochrome photos. The front camera comes with a 8 MP selfie shooter. It is important to note that both the cameras lack OIS and provide only EIS.\nWith my brief time with the camera, I found my initial pictures good but will have to take more shots to see how capable the camera really is. Below are some sample shots.\nThe camera app, however, is poorly implemented. It is slow and there is few seconds delay when you switch modes or change settings. I did find the focus and shutter speed to be OK though.\nThe Essential Phone ships with Android 7.1.1 with no custom skin. This means you will experience Android in it's purest form - no extra features, no gimmicks - just the bare bones. There is literally no bloatware and the default setup comes with just the essential 24 apps and nothing else.  \nI enjoy minimalism and the Essential Phone is just that - a minimal design and software that provides a premium experience. In the next weeks, I will be publishing my detailed review of the Essential Phone here in the Community Reviews section and in my YouTube channel once I have used it extensively to see what it offers. \nIf you are interested in more tips and tricks videos and reviews, make sure you also subscribed to my YouTube channel.", "time": "09-01-2017 02:56 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5952972", "text": "thanks", "time": "09-02-2017 04:23 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5953635", "text": "Thanks.

Fresh out of the gate today is BLU\u2019s brand new flagship device, the Vivo 8. BLU stands for Bold Like Us, and this new iteration of the Vivo series is definitely bold. You may remember a previous review I did on the BLU R1 Plus, earlier in the year. I had a few hang ups with the previous device, but the Vivo 8 is in a class of its own among BLU\u2019s devices, and by far, it is their most competitive model to date. It\u2019s rocking a full 1080p display, 4GB of RAM, a fingerprint sensor built into the home screen (insert internal fist pump), and a flash on the front-facing selfie camera. Wanna learn more? Of course you do! Especially at the introductory price of $199, and a regular price of $299. Pricing: Pricing and Specs are usually the first things I look for, so I\u2019ll go ahead and share them with you. The MSRP is $299, but BLU has partnered with Amazon for an exclusive 48-hour sale, which means you can pick up one of these delightful phones for $199 USD, which is a great deal. The regular MSRP of $299 still makes the phone competitive, but not as attractive as the introductory offer. The Vivo 8 comes in two colors: black and gold.Specs:\n-\tAn Octa-core MediaTek P10 Helio processor (and Mali GPU), clocked at a top end speed of 2.0ghz\n-\t4GB of memory \n-\ta 5.5\u201d curved display, with 1920x1080 full-HD resolution, made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 (401ppi)\n-\tA 4,010 mAh battery\n-\t64GB of internal storage (expandable; supports up to 64GB SD card)\n-\tA 13MP main camera with Sony IMX sensor and LED flash\n-\tA 16MP \u201cSuper Selfie\u201d front-shooter, with LED flash (fancy!)\n-\tRuns Android 7.0 Nougat\n-\tBonus --- it also comes with earphones, a clear TPU style case, and a screen protector (installation required)Overview and Performance: \nHaving listed the price and specs, I think it\u2019s fairly reasonable that this device is something to be excited about. I have had the opportunity to spend some time with this device leading up to the launch date and I have to admit, in the beginning, I had a few apprehensions. First and foremost, it has a MediaTek processor in it, and Sony has given me a terrible taste in my mouth for these chipsets. However, after firing the phone up and playing around with it, a couple of things helped change my mind. First, it\u2019s not a Sony. Second, it\u2019s very affordable. Third, it performs very well, especially for day-to-day usage and some light multitasking (you can even go split-screen mode!). For the price and the expectations that I had, I was very pleased with the smoothness of the user interface and performance during normal app usage. I tested it out on a couple of games and it definitely doesn\u2019t have the straight-line speed of an 8xx series SnapDragon, but it\u2019s also not supposed to. The P10 chipset is on par with the SnapDragon 625 series, which I have used on a daily basis in my BlackBerry KEYOne, as well as my Moto G5 Plus. All of them handle processing on pretty much the same tangible and appreciable playing field, with their not-so-subtle compromises on graphics intense games. It definitely doesn\u2019t play War Robots or some more 3D intensive games very well, but touch and click style games work well \u2013 enter stage left, Boom Beach (yup. I\u2019m still playing it), and Alto. Display: Overall, I have been very impressed with the graphics. The color saturation is average, and the brightness is not disappointing. I have not been a huge fan of 1080p devices since UHD graphics came along, but that's mostly because I bounce around quite a bit in the higher-tier phone market where that is an expectation for me. 5.5\u201d is actually a good screen size for 1080p, because the difference isn\u2019t even noticeable to most people\u2019s eyes. I\u2019m not going to get into the science of it all, but 5.2\u201d is the optimum size for a 1080p screen, and 5.5\u201d isn\u2019t stretching the envelope; increased resolution isn\u2019t something that\u2019s a selling point to me in this price range, but a 4,010mAh battery most certainly is.Battery Life: The battery life on this phone is phenomenal. The P10 is a fairly fuel efficient chipset. I won\u2019t go out on a limb and say it\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d than the SD 625 - which it is directly competing with - but the massive battery more than makes up for any minute compromises that you may think you're giving up by choosing this device. The closest mainstream comparison phone to the Vivo 8 is the Moto G5 Plus, which boasts a 3,000mAh battery. Both devices even utilize USB 2.0, which is a little bit dated, but not outside the realm of acceptability. The battery charging capability of the Vivo 8 is also best-in-class for BLU phones, supporting its own iteration of QuickCharge, called \u201cSUPER CHARGE\u201d, which will get your phone completely recharged in just two hours \u2013 if you can manage to kill it in a day.Fingerprint Sensor: I am very happy that the Vivo 8 has incorporated a fingerprint sensor. When fingerprint sensors first came out, I hated them. They were slow, clumsy, and rarely worked on the first try. As they became more and more integrated into devices, I have found that I much prefer them to a pattern or pin passcode, and use them as my primary means of biometrics and security. I have never really cared for the fingerprint sensors that are mounted on the back of the phone. It seems like they\u2019re never in the right place - especially on the new Samsung devices\u2026 With the Vivo 8, all of my fingerprint sensor dreams have come true, because not only is it a FPS, it\u2019s also a home button! Yes, you can push down on it and get to the home screen (hooray). If you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m very happy about this, and it works well. Honestly, it took a bit of a learning curve for me to get used to it because of the industry standard, where fingerprint sensors don\u2019t\u2019 function as home buttons, so pressing down on it was unintuitive. Now that I\u2019m used to it, I\u2019m very happy with it and wish that more phone manufacturers adopted this feature.Sound: The sound on the phone is very good, and definitely better than many other phones off the shelf now-days, especially in this class of phone. The dual speaker setup on the phone is very much akin to the iPhone, and it works well. I especially like the downward firing speakers because the sound bounces right off of your hands, which directs the sound toward you when you're holding it. The volume is great, and it puts out some pretty good sound in the mid, to high range \u2013 the cello on the Game of Thrones intro sounds fantastic! The bass isn\u2019t spectacular, but it works well for watching shows/movies and casual usage. Oh, and bonus\u2026. It has a 3.5mm jack, which also makes me a happy camper. This recent trend of no headphone jack and requiring a converter is for the birds, unless you are lucky enough to have Bluetooth everything for all of your audio needs. If you\u2019re a person who still likes to jam out with your 2015/16 era headphones or uses an auxiliary cord, you will definitely appreciate that BLU held onto this feature in the Vivo 8.Camera: The camera on this phone is definitely good for taking casual photos, but it was built for selfies. One of the biggest selling points of this device is the fancy, and novel, LED flash setup on the front-facing selfie camera, which boasts an enormous 16MP camera, which happens to be larger than the 13MP rear camera, which is ok. It\u2019s not a bad camera, and BLU went out of their way in an effort to step up their game and included a Sony IMX sensor into the design. The interface has a few novel gestures, such as swiping down on the screen to flip between the front and rear camera, which I have grown to love. Ok, back to the selfie camera; if you like filters, you are going to love this phone. I am not much of a selfie taker, but you can do all sorts of fun and cool things like night shot mode, slimming (well, cause why not?), whitening, and smoothing. I didn\u2019t really find that any really helped my face look any better (funny, not funny), but they are cool if you feel like a little bit of photoshopping on the fly. There is also a built-in camera app called \u201cZ Camera\u201d, which allows you to get super fancy and put emoji\u2019s and stickers on your photo, create collages, do picture-in-picture (PIP) photos, and much more (like adding different hair colors and sculpted muscle bound enhancements to your photos that you\u2019ve always wanted at the touch of your fingertips) \u2013 you don\u2019t even have to burn calories in the process. However, I have to say this\u2026 it\u2019s full of ads and requires additional downloads within the app. On a bonus note, many of them are free.Software: I know there are some existing hang-ups with their software and some security concerns, which culminated in their phones being pulled down from Amazon briefly, not too long ago. However, they were quickly put back up for sale, and the security issues were qualified by informing the public that the software suite is no longer installed on newer devices, and only applied to previous generation phones. So\u2026 they\u2019re ok. I can\u2019t vouch for the security versus a BlackBerry, Samsung or Google device, but I can\u2019t say that about a lot of phones. I am happy to report that the device comes with Android 7.0 Nougat, which was a welcome surprise, especially since other mainstream devices still don\u2019t have it. The inclusion of Android 7.0 definitely went a long way with me in helping to legitimize the efforts of BLU to appeal to a more mainstream audience. It still has their own little enhancements to the UI, to include swiping from the bottom to get to the menu settings, and the top-down swipe is reserved for notifications only. The stock android experience isn\u2019t modified too much, but you will notice little enhancements or changes here and there. Conclusion: All in all, I thoroughly enjoy using the Vivo 8, and I have no hesitation in recommending it. The Vivo 8 is a quality device that anchors itself very well within the competition, especially at the introductory price point of $199. I would highly recommend getting one at $199, but I can also make a solid argument for purchasing one at $299. Of course, I can also debate other phones as well. That\u2019s one of the beauties of the mobile device industry. There are almost as many colors, shapes and sizes, as the day is long. We are mostly free to pick and choose our fancies among a wide spread of styles and manufacturers. However, if you\u2019re looking for a great value, with excellent performance and an even better price tag, check out the Vivo 8. \nNormally I do a Pro\u2019s and Cons list at the end of the review, but I was so positive in many of the areas of the phone that I feel like a better explanation of some of the features I didn\u2019t care for is in order. Things I don\u2019t like:\nThe buttons don\u2019t light up, so you have to remember which side of the phone is for \u201cback\u201d, and \u201cmenu\u201d. There are two little dots that represent where the buttons are, and unless I got a defective unit, they don\u2019t light up. \nThe curved edge display. It sounds nice on paper, but it\u2019s not really a selling point for this phone. The curve in the display is not very noticeable at all, unlike other manufacturers who has incorporated curved displays into their devices.\nThere is no app drawer. I really like app drawers (except for my brief romance with the EMUI setup on the Huawei P8 Lite I had a few years ago, which I really enjoyed). However, that season of my life is over and I have discovered that I am much happier with app drawers. I do not like my screen to be cluttered, and I am very deliberate in the way that I organized my icons. This was a turn off for me, but it\u2019s mostly preference, and not anything \u201cwrong\u201d with the phone.\nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up a Vivo 8 device, you can find them on Amazon\u2019s website today, 30 August 2017, with exclusive pricing on Amazon for 48-hours, starting Thursday, August 31st through 11:59pm EST, on the 1st of September. The normal price is going to be $299, but during the 48-hour sale, they are discounting it by $100, for a grant total of $199.

There are a lot of custom launchers available today ranging from simple to advanced depending on what you are looking for in a launcher.Evie\nBefore diving into the details, first things first. You can install the Evie launcher from the Play Store here. You will need an android device that runs Android 4.4 and above to install the launcher.\nEvie Launcher falls into the simple category of android launchers. Evie launcher gives you the needed configurations to make the launcher your own and sits as a gateway to finding the information you want right from your home screen.\nThanks to Google we are just a search away to find the information we want. What if the launcher helped you find that information you want by augmenting different sources and giving you the results without ever leaving your home screen. Evie does exactly that.First run experience\nThe first run experience of the launcher gives you a good on-boarding experience that shows what you can do with Evie.\nI found it to be an useful and a delightful experience.\nOnce the initial setup is done, you get a simplistic minimal homescreen.Search and you shall get it\nOnce all set, it isn\u2019t any different to other launchers until you want to find something in the internet. With a simple swipe down gesture from your home screen, you get access to this powerful search that searches across different apps (and the internet) to give you the best results possible.\nFor example, if you want to search for an attraction or a place, Evie can help you do so.\nHere, I am searching for seattle science and you can see Evie already shows me what I am looking for\u200a\u2014\u200aPacific Science Center.\nTapping on the result, gives me a quick overview of the attraction, along with links to the web site and a direct call button. The search results page also augments information from other apps and gives direct links to directions, reviews and even to get a ride and buy tickets.\nSimilarly, you can search for movies, apps, restaurants etc., right from your home screen.\nThe concept of augmenting results to help you find what you are looking for isn\u2019t new but Evie delivers the results with a simplistic and intuitive experience that is easy to use.\nOne thing to note is that Evie uses Google by default and there isn\u2019t an option to change the default search engine.Personalization options\nEvie launcher provides few personalization options that many may find it just enough to personalize the launcher to your needs.\nTo start with simple options, you can long tap the home screen which reveals options to change the wallpaper, add widgets and open settings.\nSettings is where you can find the interesting options. I quite like how they show a quick preview of the settings you choose so you know how the homescreen looks or behaves.\nLets look at some of the personalization options.\nWith the Homescreen, you can configure number of columns, rows, icon sizes and even icon labels (which is my favorite!).\nWith the Dock, you can enable/disable the dock and configure number of columns, icon size, background and icon labels. Note that the dock is disabled by default.\nWith the Icon pack, you can choose a custom icon pack for your launcher. What I like though is a quick link at the bottom that takes you to the Play Store to find more icon packs.App drawer\nEvie allows two app drawer styles\u200a\u2014\u200aList and Grid\u200a\u2014\u200aand uses the Nougat style gesture, swipe up from the bottom of the homescreen, to open the app drawer.\nYou can configure the style either right from the app drawer or from the settings.Gestures\nMany launchers support gestures and Evie does too. However, it is limited in the options. When writing this review, Evie has only 3 gestures. I find these gestures to be nothing but basic, providing access to the key stuff like Google Now and search.\nI hope Evie will add support for more gestures in the upcoming versions as gestures helps to perform various actions without cluttering your homescreen setup.Backup and restore options\nEvie provides a simple backup and restore option incase you switch devices or mess up your existing setup. It uses your Google account to store the setup in the cloud.Final thoughts\nOverall, Evie launcher is simple and intuitive with a great setup that allows you to personalize your device to your needs. Be it applying custom icon packs or customizing the homescreen layout or finding the information you are seeking for, Evie makes it simple and easy to use.\nGive it a try today and let us know what you think!\nIf you are interested, you can also join their beta program and get access to latest and greatest features.", "time": "04-04-2017 08:03 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5941029", "text": "yeah i love the futuristic, good looking launcher. its beautiful.\nseem's abit like ios on iphone.", "time": "08-27-2017 07:29 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "BlackBerry KEYone Leather Case", "thread": [{"postID": "post5937199", "text": "The BlackBerry KEYone is arguably the best phone BlackBerry has ever made. The beautiful design with a gorgeous screen and incredible BlackBerry keyboard, combined with a near stock Android experience with a few usable additions, make it a truly compelling device. As such, you want a truly compelling and beautiful case to go with it right? Of course you do! Well SatchelSatchel heard you, and boy did they answer. The Good: Hard to go wrong with leather\nSatchelSatchel is a small company that specializes in making hand-made, high quality leather bags and accessories. They recently decided to bring their skill and experience into the world of phone cases and their efforts show here. Everything about this case exudes luxury and craftsmanship. It is beautifully stitched together and the leather is gorgeously tanned for a great look, feel, and yes, smell. Call me crazy but there\u2019s something about the way leather smells that\u2019s just awesome. The KEYone fits into the case quite well with a solid hold, but not being so tight that the phone is hard to get out. There is an extra pouch sewn into the front of the case to allow for business cards or possibly a credit card. The clasp that holds the whole thing closed is solid so you won\u2019t have to worry about your phone slipping out, but it\u2019s still plenty easy to open. \nIf the leather design is not cool enough for you, these guys are actually double agents! They are not just cases, but they are holsters too! That\u2019s right! You can relive the glory days of BlackBerry by throwing these on to your hip for even quicker access. And you\u2019ll probably want to, too. The KEYone is already a fairly large device and once inside the case, you won\u2019t want it to be spending much time in your pocket. The only way to really carry it comfortably is on your hip...like a hipster. Get it?? There are actually two options for hip-carrying. There\u2019s a belt loop that is sewn into the leather on the back, or you can opt for a belt clip that rotates allowing you to carry it vertically or horizontally (the belt loop only allows for horizontal transportation). \nIt comes in three amazing colors: Black, Brown, and Natural Tone, which starts out as more of a beige or skin-tone color, but it ages and colors beautifully with use and sunlight. The Bad: It\u2019s big...and not in a good way\nFor all the beauty of the design, there are a few things about this case that I\u2019m not a fan of. First, the small pouch on the front, while large enough to hold business cards, cash, or a lone credit card, is quite tight, making it fairly difficult to remove said items once inside. Now it may loosen up over time, but I\u2019ve only had the cases for a couple of weeks so I can\u2019t really speak to that. In my experience, it actually made it more inconvenient than using my pocket or wallet. \nSecond, I\u2019m just not a holster kind of guy. Now this is entirely personal preference, but I just don\u2019t like or use holster cases. Also, the colors I was sent would be even more difficult for me to wear because I just personally don\u2019t think they look that great on the hip. There is a black version of the case which would probably look much better but I didn\u2019t receive that one. Again, this is almost entirely personal preference, but I like to be honest. It would be hard for me to wear these on my hip every day. \nMy last issue with this case is the size. Let me qualify this by saying that I\u2019m more of a minimalist when it comes to cases, but this thing is not small, inconspicuous or subtle. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it looks great, but it\u2019s very noticeable. That may not bother you but for me it makes it almost unwieldy. Like I said before, the KEYone is not a small phone and when you put a large phone into a large holster, everything just gets bigger, and not necessarily in a good way. Once again, a lot of this is personal preference, but I\u2019m just trying to let you know what you\u2019re getting into. \nI admit that I may very well may be over-exaggerating a bit here, but these are just my impressions of the thing. You won\u2019t really know for yourself until you have one. They do have a 30 day return policy for undamaged, unused units so give it a shot!The Ugly: It\u2019s gonna cost ya\nI\u2019m just going to throw it out there, this thing is expensive. The belt loop model is a cool $118 (yeah that\u2019s what I said) and the belt clip version is 10 bucks more at $128 before taxes and shipping. Yes, you pay for shipping. That\u2019s hard to swallow, especially since BlackBerry\u2019s own leather case is $40 (some are even cheaper). Yes, it\u2019s hand made and it comes in three different colors, but $118 is a lot of money for ANY case. There was only one other manufacturer I found that even comes close to that price and they offer customization options and quite a few more colors too. \nLet me say it again though, this case is gorgeous. What you are paying for is an extremely high quality design and build that is so good, you most likely will never need to use the lifetime warranty. This thing isn\u2019t made in a factory and you won\u2019t be able to find another or better hand-crafted leather case/holster combo out there. If you really want to complete the look of luxury with your KEYone then this is absolutely the case to get. It\u2019s big, it\u2019s expensive, and it makes quite a statement. If that\u2019s your thing, then head on over to their website and pick one up. I recommend Black...or Brown...or the Natural Tone, you know what?

But I have been trying to narrow down a decision between a Samsung Galaxy S7 and a HTC 10 for ages but recently I jumped in and decided to order the HTC 10. But now I have regrets over my decision mainly because Samsung is such a big brand wireless charging etc. But I heard the HTC is also a good phone. But just googled reviews for both phones and the S7 got mostly 5 stars while HTC 10 varied between 4-5. Should have read reviews first eh? \nSo are my concerns dumbfounded and are there any reasons to choose the HTC 10 over the S7? I need reassurance as to return the phone would take a while up to a month to get my refund so would be without a new phone for a while sigh. But if you guys think it would be best to go with S7 over 10 I feel I would go the extra mile. I am generally indecisive so this may be as a result of it.\nThanks for all your input,\nDroidGuy1999", "time": "08-12-2017 04:43 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5921705", "text": "Well first of all, welcome here! \nI couldn't speak for the HTC 10 but the S7 is a great device. However that's my personal opinion about it. That's what's important here. Some people will tell you the HTC 10 is way better, others will tell you that the S7 is the best choice. Using a phone is how you can decide for yourself. \nThe fact that Samsung is a big brand doesn't make their products better. Also, you have to remember that Samsung does a whole lot of marketing. HTC is also a big brand but they don't do as much marketing.\nAlso, Samsung always gets amazing scores except from the purists who prefer stock Android (who wouldn't like HTC's version either) or for the Samsung users who, after a while of use, tend to start feeling their phones slow down, which is nothing a factory settings reset can't fix.\nI know this hasn't helped you in any way because the only way to know if a phone is good for you is not by looking at the reviews or judging by the marketing a company does. It's by using it. I changed phones rather a lot in the last years because it's only after you use it as a daily driver that you can see how it suits you, the things you like or dislike and so on.\nSo my advice would be to just try the HTC and see if you enjoy it. Use it, take pictures, record videos, install apps, customize it to your liking. And if you don't like it after that, if you still can, return it and get the S7. But you'll have to go through the same process. \nHope I was helpful even just a little!", "time": "08-12-2017 05:18 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5921725", "text": "You're points make great sense!

[{"title": "Review: Speck Presidio Grip Case for the LG G6", "thread": [{"postID": "post5919950", "text": "As part of the Android Central Community Review, I got the chance to review the Speck Presidio GRIP case for the LG G6. The case is advertised to give you superior protection and is designed to withstand the impact of up to 10 feet. I have been using this case for a few weeks now and below is my review of the Speck Presidio GRIP case for the LG G6.\nThe first thing you notice as you hold the case is how flexible and durable the material of the case is. Speck has done a great job in putting the durable polycarbonate layer along with the shock absorbing material, called Impactium, on the sides together to provide the much-needed protection for your G6. According to Speck, this Impactium design is 52% more shock absorbent than standard TPU cases. \nWhile Speck advertises this as a slim design, it does add quite a bit of thickness to the phone, especially on the sides where it is designed to absorb impact. Considering that, I would say it is certainly slimmer than hard protective cases. As I used my phone with the case, I also felt it added extra weight as it felt heavier than normal. \nThe next thing you notice as you put your phone in the case is the strong grip it provides. The raised rubber edges along the sides, which extend almost to the entire back, will make sure the phone stays in your hands no matter what you are doing and avoid accidental slips. This is one of the best grips I have used since the Cover-up Woodback Explorer Case.\nThese high raised ridges not only help in providing a no-slip layer but also play an important part in the protection as they are designed to absorb impact and disperse shock. \nThe case provides perfect cutouts for the ports at the bottom. I did not find any issues using the charging cable or to the sound coming out of the speakers. \nThe raised cutouts for the camera and the fingerprint sensor at the back are very good. They provide good protection to the camera and the fingerprint sensor when you put your phone down. The raised fingerprint sensor cutout also makes it easier to locate if you have trouble with it. \nIn the front, however, there is little to no protection for the screen. It lacks the usual high raised lips that you find in many other cases that keep the phone's display a few millimeters off the surface when you put your phone to rest face down. This is the biggest drawback of this case and probably the deciding factor if you need such protection for your G6. Speck does advertise that the case features a patented raised bezel screen protection but I am unable to see that with almost no raised lips around. \nOverall, the case performs well and if you are looking for that case with perfect grip and superior protection along the edges, then the Speck Presidio GRIP is a great choice for your G6. \nYou can purchase the case directly from Speck or Amazon and is available in the following colors:Black/BlackGraphite Grey/Charcoal GreyMarine Blue/Twilight BlueRobin Egg Blue/Tide Blue", "time": "08-11-2017 12:14 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Speck Presidio Case for Samsung Galaxy 8", "thread": [{"postID": "post5915517", "text": "Looking for a case made by a well-known manufacturer with a track record for excellence, and superior quality protection for your device? If this sounds like an item on your phone case wish list, then let me introduce you to my new friend, the Speck Presidio Case for my S8. In my pursuit to find balance between protection, aesthetics and form factor, the Speck Presidio was next on my list to try out on my Samsung Galaxy S8. \nAnyone who has been carrying around a smartphone for a while has undoubtedly seen some of Speck\u2019s other case offerings, either online, at your local Best Buy, or spotting them out in the wild on other people\u2019s phones. Honestly, this is the first case that I have ever owned by Speck, so when I got the opportunity to do a review on it I was happy to try out some new gear for my prized tech.The Look: Fresh out of the box, the first thing you\u2019re going to figure out about this case is that it\u2019s solid. I\u2019m not talking typical plastic shell solid, or faux-construction; it\u2019s like an artificial turtle shell, minus the possibility of losing a finger. The appearance isn\u2019t flashy, but the construction of the device, along with the feel, let you know that your phone is going to be safe inside this case. Once you pull the case out of the packaging and flip it over, you\u2019ll notice one of the unique design characteristics that Speck has included with the Presidio model. In the days of old, many protective cases relied on a 2-piece approach, which included a soft, gel-like case, with a clip-on plastic cover to add strength and integrity to the case system. However, Speck has found a way to combine these different characteristics into a fancy one-piece system, which they refer to as \u201cImpactium.\u201d Impactium is an evolution of the protective gel-skin concept which has been machined into the interior of the case, which makes the phone fit snugly, and provides a dense, rubbery cushion on the inside of the case which dampens and absorbs impact that your phone might experience if you drop it. All in all, the case design is sharp, and there are several combinations of colors to choose from. The one that I have is two-toned, graphite grey/charcoal grey, but it comes in six other color options: black/black, marine blue/twilight blue, aloe green/periwinkle blue, watermelon pink/island pink, demure pink/quartz pink, and bellflower purple/ash grey. The Feel: Like I said previously, the quality of the Speck Presidio is solid. From head to toe, the entire case has been built with two things in mind: security, and protection. Many protective style cases are bulky, clumsy, and require assembly when you initially put the phone on in the case, but not the Presidio. The unibody design is sleek and simple, but gives you the quality of protection that is synonymous with the other case designs in its class. According to Speck, the Presidio case, with its Impactium Barrier technology, will protect your phone from drops up to 10ft, which is impressive for a phone case with such a slim profile. On a side note, the drop protection is definitely important because the case is quite slick. I recently switched over from a traditional TPU style case, which is naturally a little grippier, and the Presidio case took some getting used to. I had to adjust the way that I hold and use the phone because it kept slipping out of my fingers. The slippery texture of the phone definitely won\u2019t get stuck in your pocket though, so it makes it ideal for personal or professional settings where your phone is kept in a nearby pocket for quick access. The button covers are unremarkable and do not require much extra effort to use, and they are easy to palpate on the edges of the case. Protection: Protection is where the Presidio really shines. Not so much because of the style of the case, but because of the work that went into designing it. The case itself is not cheap (MSRP on their website is $39.95), which may be a turnoff for some. But, in contrast to other cases of this caliber and protection quality, the market price is competitive. From the get-go, you\u2019ll be able to tell from looking at it and holding it that the device is made with superior quality materials \u2013 polycarbonate to be exact! In addition to the protective shell, it also wraps around and provides a slight bezel of protection for superior screen protection, especially when you want to lay your phone face down on normal surfaces. The website does advertise that the design is \"scratch resistant\", but I haven't found this to be very accurate. Mine incurred quite a few surface scratches in just a short time of usage, and I take very good care of my phones/cases, and carry it around in a pocket without anything else in it. Other than the surface scratches though, the phone case is incredibly solid.\nConclusion: All in all, the Speck Presidio is an excellent case, which provides great protection. However, I can\u2019t buy into it completely because of its slick nature. Even though the phone is well protected, there has been more than a time or two where the phone has nearly slipped out of my hand, especially when I was laying down trying to use the phone one-handed. I was able to adapt to carrying the case as time went on, but initially it was very off-putting. I do actually like a lot of the features though, especially the Impactium barrier inside the case, as well as the protective lip to add an extra buffer between surface contact and your screen. However, the slick exterior and ease of which the surface scratches is a bit of a turn off for me. For the price, it\u2019s competitive with other manufacturers of similar design and quality, and the impact protection is top-notch, which should get you through any minor harrowing event that your phone may encounter. All in all, Speck did a lot of things really well with the Presidio case, but the nuances are a little more than I\u2019m willing to accept for a daily driver. Of course, your mileage may vary, and your personal interests may be different than mine. If you like it, go for it! If you\u2019re looking for something else in a phone case, there are lots of alternatives to choose from.

The nylon version is slippery.CONTEXT\nRecently, I popped into Best Buy to pick up my first ever Moto Mod: The Moto Style Shell with Wireless Charging, in \u201cGrey Herringbone Nylon\u201d. Currently available in either Grey Herringbone Nylon or Floral Print with some press hinting at the availability of wood options in the future. I elected to buy this grey one in person. I decided the more subtle grey option was more my style than the colorful flowers available online. \nI was actually mildly surprised that the cover was nylon fabric instead of the grey plastic I anticipated, but that was more on me neglecting to read up on the specifics before hopping in.\nJust so you know what I\u2019m equipped with, I own a Moto Z Play with the charcoal ash wooden style shell, pictured above for reference.THE BOX\nThe Mod\u2019s packaging is very straightforward. It\u2019s a simple box containing the shell itself and two pamphlets to cover the usual legal, instructions, etc.THE COVER\nThe cover itself isn\u2019t anything unexpected. It\u2019s slightly thicker than my current wooden Style Shell at 3.25 mm and includes several pogo pins to enable charging. Why it needs more than two or three pins though for wireless charging is beyond me.\nThis new shell includes magnets on both the top and bottom of the cover, making for a more secure fit than my wooden back which only includes a magnet near the bottom. A particularly hot day in the car once made this wooden cover bend backwards slightly, compromising the fit. The extra magnet here is much appreciated.\nThe nylon feels like a textured velvet or a woven fabric and isn't really my cup of tea, although it certainly looks good. USAGE\nSnapping on the back greeted me with a distinctive chime and a quick tutorial on using this Mod, just in case I had neglected to read the quick-start guide like I\u2019m sure many others will do.\nIn the hand, the additional thickness and curvature isn\u2019t particularly noticeable, but what is much more noticeable to me is that the nylon back made for a textured but more slippery surface. \nThis may not sound like much, but with less friction I found myself adjusting to it in ways that were ultimately less than comfortable. It might be a nitpick as I didn\u2019t notice it entirely, but my pinky didn\u2019t appreciate its increased usage as a shelf nor did I appreciate a gravitational close call when the phone didn't quite stick to my fingers like I had anticipated. I\u2019ve switched back to my smoother-yet-grippier wooden back for now while I plan to switch this one out for it's floral print sibling.CHARGING\nAnd as for charging? It works.\nPlacing the phone on a charging pad makes the phone indicate that a wireless charger was detected and displays current battery percentage for a few moments before going to the lockscreen.\nThe OS says \u201ccharging slowly\u201d on my 10W somewhat generic Qi charger. Needless to say, you don\u2019t use wireless charging when you\u2019re looking for a speedy, efficient charge anyway. The Z\u2019s support \"TurboPower\" for if you\u2019re in a rush.\nUltimately, being the fan that I am for wireless charging, I was very excited for this shell but the material isn't exactly lighting my fire. The functionality works perfectly though, and if I like the feel of the floral back, that one might just become a permanent fixture on the back of my Moto. In the meantime, this nylon back isn't for me.The attached Mod next to a first-generation style shell.", "time": "08-06-2017 02:15 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5914421", "text": "Additional PhotosThis is only displayed for a few moments when charging begins.Charcoal Ash Style Shell on the left, Grey Herringbone Nylon Wireless Charging Style Shell on the right", "time": "08-06-2017 02:30 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5923640", "text": "Nice review/work up", "time": "08-14-2017 06:05 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5925230", "text": "Great review.

With its unique design, the CrashGuard bumper case is designed to provide drop protection that can withstand drops of at least 11ft. The tempered glass screen protector is reinforced to handle stress, drops, and scratches. So, how do they both stack up? \nBelow is my review of the CrashGuard Bumper Case and the Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S8. CrashGuard Bumper Case\nInstead of covering the phone entirely, the CrashGuard bumper case just covers the sides of your phone. The back of your phone is exposed though. \nIt is best to slide your phone into the top of the case first and then slowly securing the bottom when putting the case onto your phone. This will ensure the case fits properly to your phone. The sides of the case are slim while the corners, top, and the bottom provide a tight fit.\nThat said, the entire back of your phone is exposed. While the top and the bottom have raised lips to protect the back from the surface, it could only protect you on flat surfaces as opposed to uneven surfaces. So, the S8's glass back surface will be prone to scratches in such situations. Personally, I did not enjoy the glass surface being exposed as I always had the fear of getting it scratched. That's one of the reasons I use a clear case instead!\nSince the case only covers the top, bottom, and the sides, you get cutouts only for the bottom ports. Nothing fancy, but they do provide ample space for you to work with the ports. \nThe top and the bottom on the front also has raised lips to keep your display protected when you lay your phone face down.\nAs much as I like this simple design, it left me uncomfortable carrying it around due to the fact that now the back of the phone has got all my fingerprint smudges and other small dirt. Luckily, I did not get any scratches!\nThe case's edges are so flimsy that you can literally get the phone's edges exposed along with the buttons. I was really worried about this as this design would certainly allow the edges to be prone to drops if the phone falls down at a certain angle with the impact raising the edges and thereby damaging them.\nSo unless you want the simplicity and enjoy the glass back, then go for it. Otherwise, there are plenty of other cases that provide better protection covering all the sides of the phone. \nYou can buy the bumper case directly from RhinoShield for $24.99.Tempered Glass Screen Protector\nUnlike most other screen protectors you find in the market, the RhinoShield tempered glass screen protector for the Samsung Galaxy S8 is designed to also protect the curved edge to edge design and thereby giving you that much-needed protection to those edges. \nOnce applied the screen protector fits perfectly. No bubbles or whatsoever. It's a perfect fit. I did notice that I had to press harder on the display to complete some of the actions like typing on the keyboard or long press on the icons. This made me uncomfortable as I did not like the fact that I had to apply more force to the display.\nNot to mention that this screen protector loves your fingerprints!\nHowever, the screen protector has one major flaw - it is not compatible with any case, even RhinoShield's own CrashGuard bumper case. \nThe design of the screen protector is such that the adhesive is on the sides rather than on the main display area. Any disturbance to those edges will cause the protector to malfunction and raise the non-adhesive areas. The main display area, therefore loosens up and makes it impossible to use the screen!\nTo test this, I tried the screen protector with the Ringke Flex S case, Seidio Dilex case and RhinoShield's own CrashGuard bumper case - the screen protector failed miserably. As soon as you put the case, the force raises the screen protector's edges thereby loosening the main display area and making it impossible to use the display. \nIf you carry your S8 without any case, then this screen protector will be a good fit for you. Otherwise, this is useless. I had high hopes for this screen protector as it is equipped with all capabilities you want on a screen protector.\nIf you are still interested in this screen protector, you can buy it directly from RhinoShield for $24.99.", "time": "08-04-2017 01:11 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Ringke Flex S Case for Samsung Galaxy S8 Review", "thread": [{"postID": "post5896124", "text": "Ringke Flex S Case for Samsung Galaxy S8 is a beautiful, sleek and slim case for your Galaxy S8. The stylish appearance complements the S8 very well. Below is the review of the Ringke Flex S Case for Galaxy S8: \nI have been using this case for over 2 weeks now and I really like it. It is lightweight and feels great in your hand. It is hardly going to add any weight to the S8. The outer back has a PU leather while the inner shell has a durable TPU. The PU leather, while it's not genuine leather, it is a textured coated leather that provides a smooth and fine surface. If you love genuine leather then you may not like the Flex S PU leather back but that doesn't degrade the look and feel of this case.\nThe case has precise cutouts for the headphone jack, charging port, microphone and the speakers. What I like about these cutouts is that they have ample space around the ports so it is easier to work with the cables when you want to use your headphones or charging cable. \nThe cutouts for the camera and the fingerprint sensor are also good. The raised curved edges around the fingerprint sensor cutout create a great affordance for the fingerprint sensor. The raised edges help you to easily locate the fingerprint sensor when using the S8.\nThe buttons on the side are solid and its raised design helps to locate the buttons on the case easily while using the phone. The buttons are almost so perfect that I sometimes feel I am pressing the physical phone buttons.\nThe back top and bottom feature good grip so your phone doesn't slip away when you place it on the surface. It's a nice addition to the smooth back otherwise.\nIn the front, the top and bottom have raised lips to protect your screen if you place the phone face down. On the sides, however, since the S8 is all about those curved edges, the case does not protect or cover the edges in any form.\nIn terms of protection, the Flex S case provides slim protection. If you are looking for drop protection, this case isn't going to give you that. However, with a good durable TPU inner shell, the case should provide minimal protection from any accidental drops and corner protection.\nIf you forget that the back is not a genuine leather and that you only get slim protection, the Ringke Flex S case is a great looking case for your S8. I use it every day with my S8 and love it. Its slim and sleek design complements the S8 very well. \nIf you are looking for a slim case with great style, go get the Ringke Flex S Case for your S8!\nYou can buy the case directly from Ringke Store or from Amazon and is available in the following colors: Deep blue, Red, Brown, and Gray.\nWhat do you think about the Flex S case for S8?

It looks sharp, the clear model that I have gives you a remarkable viewing experience for the fashionable exterior of the phone, it offers quality protection, but doesn\u2019t compromise on form factor, and all around it just feels good. \nRingke has been making cases for quite some time now, and the Fusion line of cases is popular with many other devices. I have personally been using the Ringke Slim cases for many of my devices for years, and that\u2019s one of the reasons I was so excited to get my hands on the new Crystal Clear Fusion case for my KeyOne. For those of you who are KeyOne owners, or prospective owners, you know there aren\u2019t a whole lot of quality cases or accessories floating around for the KeyOne \u2013 I know\u2026 I\u2019ve looked. As luck and fortune would have it, Ringke stepped up to the plate and hit a real homerun with this one, and really did the phone justice when designing this case.The Look: The old phrase, \u201cthere are many clear TPU cases, but this one is mine\u201d comes to mind, when thinking about the Crystal Clear Fusion case for the KeyOne. There are three color variations available: Clear, Smoke Black and Rose Gold Crystal, but the basic underlying principle still remains \u2013 it fits like a glove, and it really shows off the craftsmanship of the KeyOne. The only color differences you will see are in the bumpers themselves. Regardless of color, the back of the phone is the same crystal clear window. \nThere are two characteristics that I love in cell phone cases \u2013 one is minimalism (I don\u2019t like the case to be bulky or greatly modify the form factor), and the other is showing off the phone; needless to say, the Fusion case checks both of these boxes. If you\u2019re a stranger to the KeyOne, please go look at some images on the internet, because it\u2019s a gorgeous device. If you own one, you probably share many of the same sentiments that I do. You love the way the phone looks but you don\u2019t want to risk damaging it. So where\u2019s the compromise? Well, look no further because the answer is right here \u2013 it\u2019s the Ringke Fusion case. The case is called \u201cFusion\u201d for a reason. Based on my calculations, it\u2019s called the Fusion because it fuses with your phone, and provides protection, without detracting from the overall look and feel of the device. Secondly, the case really helps to bring out the device\u2019s sleek exterior, offering an unobstructed viewing experience and enhancing the overall presentation of the device. On a cautionary note, in my video, I mentioned that the case is not prone to smudges and fingerprints. While this is true, and it\u2019s the best that I\u2019ve encountered, after some use the prints and smudges will eventually build up, but can easily be wiped off with your shirt or any available cloth object.The Feel: As soon as you open the packaging, you\u2019ll be able to feel the quality craftsmanship of the Fusion case. It\u2019s rigid enough to let you know that it\u2019s going to take good care of your device, but at the same time, it\u2019s pliable enough to snugly hold onto your device, and not let go. An added design feature is a slight lip to the rim of the case, which adds a tiny buffer of protection for your screen and keyboard when you want to place the phone face-down. As I stated above, the case is made out of TPU, and it\u2019s a typical unibody, bumper style case. What does this mean? It means it\u2019s not the grippiest, and the back of the phone does not have any texturing for grip, but it would seem that this is by design. The lack of texturing is usually something that I wouldn\u2019t care for, but in the Fusion case, it just works. Why does it work? It works because it\u2019s like looking through a glass window so you can see the finely crafted rubberized backing of the KeyOne, in all of its glory \u2013 the silver BlackBerry logo, and subtle dimples in the surface really stand out underneath the crystal clear protection of the Fusion. Having said all of that, the surface of the phone case and the edges aren\u2019t particularly slippery, and it\u2019s an improvement over the stock feel of the device. And last but not least, the buttons. Like I said in my video, normally this isn\u2019t a \u201cselling\u201d point for me, which means I won\u2019t really be preaching about how great buttons are. Well, in the Fusion case, the buttons are phenomenal. The first time I ever pressed in the power button, it set off the \u201cwow\u201d lightbulb in my head. Not that it\u2019s a to die for feature, but in the world of TPU cases, I haven\u2019t found one yet that has such responsive, easily pressed key overlays. Job well done, Ringke!Protection: If you don\u2019t know already, consider this your warning: the KeyOne is not waterproof! Having said that, this case will not protect your phone from accidental, or purposeful dips into the pool, or any other body of water. Is that the case\u2019s fault? No. It\u2019s just not what the case is designed to do. What the case is designed to do is to provide protections from life\u2019s potential slips, drops and falls. The packaging states that it offers \u201cmilitary grade\u201d protection, and I\u2019m not sure what this means, other than the case is sturdy and should provide ample protection in case you accidentally knock it out of the night stand, or if it slips out of your pocket while you\u2019re sitting in a chair. It\u2019s definitely not rated for 10-15ft drops, or something I would entertain using if you\u2019re planning on doing parkour or BMX racing, but it does provide an excellent amount of protection for simple drops, especially with the reinforced bumper support around the edges. As you\u2019re probably used to by now, here\u2019s my Public Service Announcement: put a screen protector on the phone \u2013 which you can also find on Ringke\u2019s website! This isn\u2019t a plug for Ringke, but if you\u2019re ordering the case (even through amazon), throw one of these in your cart as well. Having a good case is great, but you\u2019re not going to be able to offer 360 degree security for your phone without a good screen protector as well; end PSA.Overall: The Crystal Clear Fusion case by Ringke is top-notch. It\u2019s incredibly affordable, it\u2019s sleek, fancy, and provides great protection for the device without compromising on the phones form-factor or aesthetics. After trying out several other cases for my KeyOne, I am happy to say that this one has won the special title of \u201cdaily driver\u201d status, meaning that it will be my go-to case for the foreseeable future. Is it for everyone? Maybe not. Some people prefer to go sans case, and some people want the extreme protections that have been traditionally offered by companies like OtterBox, or LifeProof But, does this case check enough boxes to make even the most protection oriented owners happy? I think so. The cardinal rule after all is that you don\u2019t drop your phone, but, life happens, which is why we buy cases! Fortunately we live in a world with many options, and so far, I definitely recommend you give Ringke\u2019s Fusion case a look!Pros:\n-\tIt looks and feels great, especially with the Crystal Clear window on the back of the phone!\n-\tIt\u2019s cost effective! It\u2019s not \u201ccheap\u201d, but it\u2019s well-priced, and impressive\n-\tIt protects the phone without compromising the look and feel of the device\n-\tThe buttons are snappy, and the craftsmanship of the case is top-notchCons:\n-\tIt\u2019s not waterproof, but it\u2019s also not designed to be. It\u2019s not a full enclosure case.\n-\tIt\u2019s not the cheapest, or the most expensive. But remember, you get what you pay for!\n-\tIt doesn\u2019t really have any texture to it, so it can still be a little slippery\n-\tWhile it is fingerprint and smudge resistant, it\u2019s not fingerprint and smudge proof. It will need to be wiped off every one in a while. \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one Ringke\u2019s new Crystal Clear Fusion cases for your KeyOne, head on over to https://www.ringkestore.com and check them out.

If so then look no further than the Cover-Up #WOODBACK Case! Imagine\u2026wood crafted by hand\u2026now imagine this on a case\u2026and all for just $24! What you get is a lovely unique REAL wood grain back, compared to many large manufacturers who use plastic and rubber in mass automated processes. Which would you prefer? I will be honest, I have used many cases, and this case is just stunning beyond belief. It\u2019s like someone plucked a wood plank from my hardwood floors and stuck it onto the back of a polycarbonate case. All this in a fairly slim profile, considering the wood back.\nCover-Up makes two cases, the #WOODBACK SNAP Case and the #WOODBACK EXPLORER Case. The one I chose was the EXPLORER model because it provides a little more protection, and better side grip\nWhat You Get\nThe case comes in a thin dark gray cardboard packing. Nothing special, but gets the job done. Protection\nCover-up has a moderately thick polycarbonate shell which would provide some amount of protection for back and corner drops, probably the most that you will see in these slim style cases. However, the front has almost no lip, and provides minimal face drop protection. With the phone face down on a table, I tried to stick a business card, and was not able to do so without touching the screen. Fitment, Feel, and First Impressions\nDid I mention that the wood back was amazing? Yes it is! Each piece of wood is laser cut to ensure precise fitment, but HAND SANDED to create a smooth exterior. The wood back is then treated to make it more durable against the elements. You can even SMELL the varnish treatment, and it is refreshing compared to the plastic and rubber smell of most cases.\nYou can gently rub the wood and actually feel the grain! Very nice! The wood back doesn\u2019t have much grip, but this is made up for in the polycarbonate part of the case, which is fairly slim, and has raised textured sides to increase grip. \nAs a disclaimer, I kept the stock back plastic on my phone, which is probably the reason why the mic hole is slightly misaligned. Aside from that, all the buttons are recessed and are well aligned, and require a moderate force to press, so as to help avoid accidental presses in the pocket. Also, the buttons aren\u2019t textured, making it easy to feel for the buttons when needed.\nPlease note that because this is real wood, no two cases are ever going to be the same! If you want your case to look like everyone else\u2019s, then this is not the case for you! However, if you want a unique case, then buy away!Why should I buy it?\nThe question I have to ask you is do you love the look and feel of well crafted wood? If yes, then you should buy this case. It is well priced at just $24! The stain I chose was Padauk, however, there are many wood stains available. What are you waiting for?

How about more pockets than that? Pockets for your pockets? 10+ pockets? Great, because that's what the Ogio Renegade RSS offers you. With a ridiculous amount of pockets on top of a laptop compartment and a main storage compartment, you can carry so much stuff on your back. Before I dive into what the Ogio Renegade RSS offers, let me start with what I can, and do, carry in mine; mind you this will have to be a simplified list. I carry my 15\" Lenovo Yoga, 13\" MacBook Pro, an mp3 player with earphones, wallet, iPad Air 2, Nintendo 3DS XL with travel case, Kindle Voyage, Jamstik+, external hard drive, battery backup, Moto G5 Plus, all associated chargers and cables, additional phone cases among other things and I could still add more stuff to the bag. I can't rightly recall how long I've had this bag, 2-4 years I know for sure. In that time carrying most of the weight of the products I listed all the time, this past weekend was the first time any part of the bag failed on me. That's to say the lower strap tie for one of the straps fell out. It didn't break, it just loosened up over the years. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the bag except a soft tie down, which I will be remedying. \nSo about those pockets\u2026.to start with you have a pouch on the left strap for a small phone, unless Ogio has made it larger since I acquired mine, and when I say small phone I mean an iPhone 5 is the largest phone that will fit in it. I used to have my old iPhone 5 in it when I travelled. On each side of the bag you have four pockets, these are great for small things like battery backups, and the lower pockets have straps for water bottles. I don't carry a water bottle around like that so I use it for other storage. I use the smaller top pockets for things like spare Apple Watch bands and earphones, I also carry my travel car charger in one of them. The pouch that rests against your back is the laptop compartment, which is lined with a soft padding and has a rigid shell to protect your laptop. Now this is where I carry my 15\" Lenovo Yoga while my 13\" MacBook Pro goes in the main compartment. The main compartment is a standard backpack compartment, you can put a lot of stuff in here as it is mostly wide open and I also carry my Jamstik+ here. Near the top you run into the tech compartment though. The tech compartment sits on top of the backpack. This is another lined, soft padded, rigid compartment that can be used to store things like sunglasses or other things you want to have additional protection. I myself put my keys in the tech compartment when I travel. \nOn the front of the bag, in front of the tech compartment, you have a small pouch with some additional small mesh pockets in it. This is where you can store small items like flash drives or the like, and this compartment holds my mp3 player, BeatsX accessories, and my Moto G5 Plus. The middle front compartment has two pockets in it; the main pouch and another lined soft padded compartment. This soft padded compartment is the tablet pouch, and it holds an iPad Air 2 sized tablet perfectly. This main pouch here is where I store all my charging cables, and my Belkin travel surge protector. The front most pouch is where you find your standard office attachments like pen holders and additional mesh pockets for other items like a computer mouse. This pouch is where I do indeed keep a pen or two, my external hard drive, my battery backup, my Kindle Voyage with charger, my Nintendo 3DS XL in it's travel pouch with charging cable, and a physical book if it doesn't go in the larger tablet pouch.\nEven if you don't know what a lot of the things I carry in my Ogio Renegade RSS are, you can easily search for them, or understand that I carry a crazy amount of stuff in my bag when I travel. Does the bag get heavy? Yes, yes it does, but there is a sternum strap on the bag to help alleviate the weight on your shoulders and it helps a lot. Make no mistake, if you want or plan to carry a lot of stuff with you, the Ogio Renegade RSS is a bag to consider, and if you don't need to carry as much, there are other options. Ogio sells some of those options as well. Trust me when I say, if you can fill the space, you will. The Good\n\u2022 Crazy amounts of storage\n\u2022 Comfortable\n\u2022 Laptop and tablet protectionThe Bad\n\u2022 A little expensive\n\u2022 Can get quite heavy\n\u2022 Cloth strap will loosen over timeConclusion\nI already pretty much wrapped up this review so I'll reiterate. The Ogio Renegade RSS will store a ridiculous amount of stuff if that's what you want, or there are other options. The Ogio website says both up to 15\" laptops and 17\" laptops will fit in the laptop compartment. I'm not sure which is accurate anymore. My model is the RSS 17 which will indeed carry up to a 17\" laptop. This bag is definitely worth considering if you're looking to carry around external battery backups, external hard drives, chargers and cables, and spend a lot of time out and about or travelling. As much as some people may dislike this next statement, it's even good if you plan on spending all day playing games like Ingress or Pok\u00e9mon Go because you can carry battery packs and even water bottles while keeping your hands free. You can find the Ogio Renegade RSS all over for $150, or you can even buy it directly from Ogio here.", "time": "06-24-2017 01:40 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Incipio Octane Pure Case for the KeyOne", "thread": [{"postID": "post5861066", "text": "Greetings, BlackBerry community. Following up from my previous video reviews of the Incipio DualPro and NGP cases, I\u2019m here to complete the three-piece set with the Octane Pure! In the world of KeyOne cases at this point, Incipio is holding a pretty solid position with a trifecta of options for your phone using pleasure. First, the DualPro is rated as the most protective of the three options, with its two-layers of support and 12ft drop protection. Second, the NGP is a bit of a compromise on total protection, but offers a cool translucent unibody design, with 3ft of drop protection. Falling squarely in the middle of the tribe, is the new Octane Pure, which compliments the aesthetics of the device by offering an unencumbered view of the beauty that is the KeyOne. It\u2019s clear, through and through, and offers a modest amount of protection due to its shock-absorbing bumper, which provides 6ft of drop protection. Look: The Octane Pure comes in two colors: clear and black. The color description is a bit misleading, because both of the cases are clear. However, the clear case is completely clear, and the black version has a smoky black colored bumper all the way around the edges of the phone. \nIf you like the way that the KeyOne looks and don\u2019t want to mess up the sharp looks and craftsmanship of the phone, then this is the Incipio case for you. It does offer modest protection, and it is a little bulky, but it\u2019s clear as glass, and it definitely shows off the unique look of the KeyOne. The only obstructed view of the device is from the edges if you get the black version. The clear version is clear throughout, but the black version has a smoke colored hue (black) around the entire bumper of the phone, which will hide the silver finish underneath the case. Other than that, the backside of the case allows you to view the KeyOne in all its glory. However, after a few minutes of using the Octane Pure, you\u2019ll see that you need to either have a cloth handy, or a way to wipe off the case because it is a fingerprint magnet. I am a bit OCD when it comes to the screen and aesthetics of my phones, so I found myself cleaning it quite often. However, your mileage may vary (YMMV \u2013 in case anyone was wondering what this acronym means out on the internet)Feel: The case itself is sturdy, a bit rigid, and the most bulky of all three of the cases. It does offer great protection for the device, with the added shock-absorbing bumper, which surrounds the entire phone on the edges and the ends. The material that Incipio used is scratch resistant, and you can feel it in the density and quality of the material used. The protection that's built into this case is excellent for device protection, but it does leave the buttons feeling a bit difficult to press and it takes a little bit of getting used to. I won\u2019t say that this is bad, because it inherently isn\u2019t, but it does make the device a little more bulky than its natural form factor, and slightly more cumbersome. Honestly though, I will say that out of all three of the cases, I felt the most secure carrying my KeyOne in this case, because of its sturdy and protective bumpers \u2013 it\u2019s just not my personal style. If you\u2019ve read my previous reviews, you\u2019ll know that I prefer a more minimalistic style in the cases that I generally use. Texture: The texture of the case is probably the most slick of all three of the cases. It\u2019s not slippery, but the rigid nature of the material, combined with a lack of texture on the back of the phone means that it is more prone to slip and slide than either the NGP or the DualPro, but it\u2019s about on par with the natural feel of the device. Although the KeyOne has a rubberized texture on the back of the device, it\u2019s not particularly grabby, and that translates over to the Octane Pure as well. The overall feel of this case is smooth, but it isn\u2019t as much of a compromise as keeping the phone bare. After all, the bumpers are excellent for protection, and you\u2019re safe up to 6ft. Summary: Overall, the case is very functional, provides quality protection and does the best job at showing off the beauty and design of the phone. Of course, there are compromises because of the blacked-out sides, and the thickness of the case, but where you\u2019re sacrificing on aesthetics, you\u2019re making up for in security. But, in the grand scheme of things, there are different cases for different reasons, and different occasions. Everybody is different. It\u2019s all about what you\u2019re looking for in a device, and what level of protection, or the look and appeal of your phone that you\u2019re trying to maintain. If you\u2019re looking for solid protection with a snazzy look that shows off your phone, and keeps it safe, then this the case for you. If you\u2019re looking for a minimalistic style case that doesn\u2019t take away from the natural form factor, then the NGP or the DualPro may be right for you. \nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing the Incipio Octane Pure, you can find it at https://www.incipio.com/cases/smartphone-cases/blackberry-cases-1/blackberry-key-one-cases/octane-pure-blackberry-key-one-case.html, as well as on Amazon.

I'm just an everyday mobile device enthusiast and regular guy trying to save a buck in the world. In pursuit of this endeavor, I decided to give Mint Sim a whirl, because why not? C\u2019mon, what can possibly go wrong with 3 months of 2GB of service for $35 (really it\u2019s $43\u2019ish because of tax and shipping), but seriously, I carry two phones with me every day and I thought it would be a great idea to try a cheap solution and see if really lives up to the hype. Also, I know lots of Mobile Nations users that carry two phones around with them, because hey\u2026 we love our technology, right? Without further ado, let the review begin.Reality Testing \u2013 Is the service provided as advertised?\nWell, the first thing you need to know is that it\u2019s pre-paid, so you have to pay for all of it up front. Since this is just a personal experiment, I opted for the 3-month plan because it\u2019s the cheapest (I also have tethering with my other phone, as a backup). Another important thing is that you only get the discounted rate if you pre-pay for 3, 6, or 12 months (5GB is $16.67, and 10GB is $20 per month), otherwise $11.67 becomes $23, for 1-month increments (5GB is $33, and 10GB is 39.67). After taxes and shipping, the actual cost for 3-months came out to about $43 USD, and arrived within two days. Important to note --- I didn\u2019t port my number over, but it\u2019s possible for you to port your number; however, you get no additional cost savings for this. Also, bear in mind that this offer is only for new customers \u2013 shall we say \u201cnewly Minted customers?\u201dSetting Up Service \u2013 How hard can it be?\nActually, it\u2019s pretty darn easy. The SIM-kit was issued a tracking number and arrived in about two days, but you can pay more for expedited shipping. The SIM-kit arrived much like any other carrier provider\u2019s would, in a card-like contraption that can be punched out for smaller sizes, so it can be used as a full-SIM, Micro, or Nano-SIM. I turned my device off, pulled out the old SIM card and popped the Mint Sim, SIM card into my phone and powered it back up. On another note, the SIM-kit does come with a little pamphlet of impressively small proportions and details how to install the SIM and setup service. Before the service will work though, you have to activate the SIM card \u2013 this is also in the little pamphlet. It only takes a few minutes. All you have to do is go to the Mint SIM homepage and up at the top there is an option for \u201cActivate.\u201d Click on the activation link and follow the few short steps, which includes inputting the activation code from the SIM-kit card. After a few minutes of working your way through the activation process, you\u2019ll be in business and can power up your device and connect to the network. I was actually pleasantly surprised at the ease of activating the SIM and establishing service! Additionally, you may have to adjust your phones APN settings, but the mini-pamphlet has all the information you need to do this for either an Android or Apple device.Performance Test \u2013 Where expectation meets reality.\nAlright, so how is the service working? Well, after a week of using the service I can tell you that it\u2019s definitely not always \u201cblazing\u201d fast, as noted by Mint SIM, but it can be\u2026 and it is adequate. If you aren\u2019t familiar with Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) work, Mint Sim piggy-backs off of the T-Mobile network \u2013 minus the ability for roaming\u2026 not supported by Mint Sim. Also, based on my understanding, Mint Sim users are naturally deprioritized, meaning in congested areas your bandwidth will be much more limited at times, which I attribute to the slower speeds that I received. However, is that necessarily bad? Well, the answer is that it depends. First, objectively, I just paid roughly $12 bucks for 2GB of LTE data, but of course it\u2019s unlimited on 2G after that \u2013 If you don\u2019t know what a 56k modem sounds like, head to YouTube. Reflecting on my experience with Mint Sim so far, I have been able to achieve download speeds of up to 21.04mbps and 12.24mbps, with a top-end 13.79mbps and 9.99mbps upload speeds (this was at 10pm, and 10am, in my suburban home) \u2013 in a side-by-side comparison with my actual T-Mobile phone, I pulled 19.84mbps download, and 10.01mbps upload. Out and about during the day my speeds have sometimes been lower. At 9am in a suburban area, I managed a much less impressive 0.36mbps download, and 1.87mbps upload, whereas with my actual T-Mobile phone I was running a 21.16mbps download, and 4.82mbps upload. But, then again, just one hour later at 10am, I managed 21.04mbps download and 9.99mbps upload speeds with Mint Sim. I have experienced similarly unimpressive speeds at other remote times and didn\u2019t think to screenshot it, but the potential for speed is exists.Fairweather Internet - How does this impact phone performance?\nHaving coped with the lower internet speeds at times, I can say that it hasn\u2019t tremendously impacted my Boom Beach connectivity, or casual browsing, or using Android Central. However, YouTube streaming and other various services are going to be disappointing at these kinds of speeds, so prepare for buffering and low-res video at times. Additionally, on several occasions I have had to turn my network antenna off and back on because of internet \u201cfreezing\u201d, meaning that data transmission stopped working \u2013 curiously, after either of these are done, the internet speed becomes much more responsive for a few minutes. On a positive note, phone calling and text messaging have appeared to be unaffected. I have actually been pleasantly surprised with the call quality and the responsiveness for messaging (no holding patterns or failure to send messages), but that needs to be balanced with connectivity and speed variances. Conclusion \u2013 Is it worth it? \nWell, again the answer is maybe. If you carry two phones around like me and can turn on wireless tethering with the other device, it really makes up for the shortfalls. If you\u2019re cool with occasional inconsistencies in data speeds, then it\u2019s also less worrisome. Call quality and messaging are more than adequate, so if you really need a cheap phone plan with the promise of internet in uncongested areas and off-peak times, this could be the answer for you. I live outside the Houston area, which if any of you are familiar with southeast Texas, you\u2019ll know that the greater Houston area is massive. I have not been able to test the network in the inner-city, which is where the best speeds and network coverage should be at. However, in the well-equipped suburbs with good T-Mobile coverage, Mint Sim doesn\u2019t always keep up. The service is adequate, but with a few asterisk here and there. Does it have enough positives to make it a viable option? I think so. If you need cost-effective communication, it\u2019s a great deal. Of course, this has been my personal experience and Your Mileage May Vary (YMMV) \u2013 So many acronyms\u2026 , so make any decisions with your best interests in mind!\n\"Does it have enough positives to make it a viable option? I think so.\"Pros:\n-\tIt\u2019s cheap and easy to setup\n-\tSometimes it\u2019s nice and fast\n-\tPhone calls and texting are reliable\n-\tInternet is manageable when it works properlyCons:\n-\tNot always \u201cblazing fast\u201d\n-\tConnectivity issues are frustrating, especially when the side-by-side comparison with an actual T-Mobile service is more reliable.\n-\tThe discounted prices are only available for first time customers, so once the initial prepayment period lapses, prices will increase.\nIf you have experience with Mint SIM, or generally have any questions or want to comment, feel free to hit me up, or head over to the comments section. \nIf you\u2019re interested, please check out Mint Sim, at http://www.mintsim.com/?utm_source=v...cUvbUpU5745682", "time": "04-05-2017 07:00 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5748015", "text": "Thanks for your effort it was a great read.\nMy experience has been a bit more positive.

So I had T-Mo proper for a 30-day period here in the northern VA/Wash DC area. In many spots I was getting download LTE speeds of 62M, 45M, but sometimes it would dip into the teens - so pretty inconsistent for a high-pop suburban region. With MintSim, my LTE speeds never were better than 22M. And at spots where I was getting 16M with T-Mo I'd get 16M (or close) with MintSim. So it appears MintSim is capped. The support staff won't admit that. And after 2 weeks haven't gotten back to me as to why their speeds don't match T-Mo's and they should. So I'm miffed about all that. Having said that though, I only use about a gig of LTE per month since I'm on wifi most of the time, and 22M isn't bad for a top speed. Also, no one beats them on unlim call/text/2GB-LTE data pricing across all carriers and MVNOs. So maybe I just suck it up, make my peace with it, and enjoy the fairly high speeds at the lowest rates around. I hate compromising - I'm not a freakin' politician afterall - but I think it's the right move at this time.

First and foremost, I want to say that I am definitely a hoodie wearer. I\u2019ve been toting around the same Rusty hoodie for years now, and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s summer, spring, fall or winter, there is always an appropriate time to wear one \u2013 and I live in Houston, Tx, the air conditioner capital of the world.\nWelcome to SCOTTeVEST, and its line of tech-oriented hoodies. SCOTTeVEST is trying to create a place for itself in the hoodie world, offering a neatly designed, utility-type hoodie that will keep you looking fashionable, give you plenty of storage space, and keep you warm all at the same time. Their slogan is \u201cexpect more from your hoodie\u201d, and they\u2019ve certainly delivered. The Hoodie Cotton is a welcomed edition to the world of hoodies, and deserves a special place in your closet. I have been searching far and wide for quite some time to find a suitable replacement for my current hoodie, which has gotten me through many rough days, weather, and all sorts of life experiences - I take hoodies personally. You can\u2019t just grab one off the shelf and expect it to have the quaint and comfortable feel that makes you say in your inner caveman voice \u201cthis mine. I wear this.\u201d But, as soon as I took the Hoodie Cotton out of the box, I was pretty much in hoodie heaven. Interested yet? The Look: The Hoodie Cotton is a bit unassuming, in that it looks like a regular hoodie, but under the hood it offers so much more. There are zippers galore, but it looks like a piece of casual clothing that anyone can wear \u2013 and should wear. The one that I received is the Ash color, but it comes in four colors: black, cobalt, ash, and maroon. The Hoodie Cotton also comes in seven different sizes, ranging from XS, all the way up to XXXL. From the front you can see the hand pockets, one on each side. The Hoodie Cotton also has the quintessential drawstrings hanging down, paired with a comfy and spacious hood \u2013 this is a big selling point with me. I hate getting a hoodie that doesn\u2019t fit proportionally. Also, another feature built into the Hoodie Cotton is what I have dubbed \u201cninja sleeves.\u201d The ninja sleeves are built into the cuffs on the hoodie and allow you to slide your thumb into them, which a) makes you look cool and b) gives some added warmth and utility to the sleeves.The Feel: In the spirit of the times (\u201czeitgeist\u201d for you lexicon enthusiasts\u2026) the feels bro! The 80/20 Cotton and Polyester blend used to create this hoodie is fantastic! It\u2019s durable, it\u2019s water resistant - meaning that if there\u2019s a little bit of rain out or a light sprinkle, you\u2019ll be protected from getting soaked \u2013 and it\u2019s comfortable. After wearing it and spending time with it, it has just enough density that it creates the warm and fuzzy feeling synonymous with quality, but it\u2019s not so bulky or heavy that it feels uncomfortable, or inappropriate for moderate climates. One of the things I love the most about hoodies in general, is that they are kind of like a utility-type piece of clothing. You can wear them in the rain. You can wear them in the snow. You can wear them when it\u2019s warm outside (because inevitably you\u2019ll be going inside somewhere with A/C), and they\u2019re perfect for the movies. SCOTTeVEST created a great hoodie, with the Hoodie Cotton, and I have thoroughly enjoyed wearing it. Utility: Let's get down to the brass tacks. Of course we want a hoodie to look great, and we want it to feel great, but one of the added benefits of strapping on an extra layer of clothing is the ability to tote things around. As many of you have learned by now, I\u2019m a dual-wielder, meaning I carry two phones at all times. Apparently the rest of the athletic world has moved on without me and I can\u2019t find a decent pair of athletic cargo shorts to save my life, so moving phones, keys, wallet, etc\u2026 around in my pockets for optimal storage can be a bit annoying at times, which is one reason I love wearing a hoodie. Well, if that brief description sounds something like your own life struggles, welcome to 21 different pockets of storage fun and excitement. The Hoodie Cotton was not only made to be comfortable, but to be a full-on tank for carrying everything from your tablet, to your phone, a rechargeable battery pack, your passport, wallet, keys, a special pathway for wearing headphones/ear buds, a \u201cdo not disturb sign\u201d, and even a spare card for your mom\u2026 all at the same time. I would say that you could even fit a kitchen sink in this thing, but it would just be too heavy to tote that thing around all day. I digress\u2026 The Hoodie Cotton has storage space for days. It has pockets on the inside, on the outside, and everywhere in between. Summary: All-in-all, SCOOTTeVEST did a fantastic job putting the Hoodie Cotton together. It meets all of the requirements that any normal hoodie wearing person would look for in a hoodie, and then it adds bells and whistles, and still looks cool. The appeal of the hoodie is even something that normal, not tech-oriented folks can appreciate as well. Who doesn\u2019t want comfortability and extra storage space, without sacrificing style or comfort? In addition to the wear-ability, it really hammers down the basics for normal wear, it adds it\u2019s own flair for the modern tech enthusiast, enabling you to carry all of your favorite electronics and tech gear with you, without having to make the tough decisions of whether you should leave your second phone, battery charger, or favorite water bottle at home. Pros: \n-\tIt\u2019s a hoodie. Can I say that? I love hoodies.\n-\tIt\u2019s comfortable and not too heavy\n-\tThe material is top-notch, durable, and made to last\n-\tIt\u2019s fashionable, and appealing to casual, and tech consumers\n-\tThe storage space! Where else in nature are you going to get 21 pockets?Cons:\n-\tNot always enjoyable when it\u2019s 85+ degrees outside\n-\tCarrying 21 items can be a bit cumbersome\n-\tThe price - $90 is a bit steep for any article of clothing \n-\tCan\u2019t try it on before you buy \u2013 sizing chart is pretty good though\n-\tThe \u201cdo not disturb\u201d flap is really cool, but isn\u2019t secured by anything so it gets in the way sometimes\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about the Hoodie Cotton, or you\u2019re just plain eager to pick one up, you can check out the Hoodie Cotton on SCOTTeVEST\u2019s website at: http://www.scottevest.com.

It's definitely more of a minimalistic style approach than the DualPro, but still offers a decent amount of protection from possible surface damage or scratches.

In the lock screen, you can just swipe the desired app up, authenticate and then open the app.\nFingerprint scanner - wake up screen\nIf you haven't noticed already, a slight tap on the fingerprint scanner can wake up your phone. This is annoying especially if your phone is inside the pocket or a bag. Fortunately, you can disable this behavior. To do so, navigate to:Settings->Fingerprint scanner\nThen uncheck the Wake-up screen option to disable this wake-up feature.Edge Sense\nWith a little squeeze gesture to your phone, you can launch an app or a shortcut as such turn on/off flashlight, turn on/off WiFi etc., You can read this post for detailed info on how to set up edge sense in your HTC U11.Navigation button backlights\nInstead of on-screen buttons, HTC U11 uses capacitive buttons for the back and recent keys. The backlight on these capacitive buttons turns on only when you use it. You can, however, change this behavior and keep the backlight on as long as the screen is on. To do so, navigate to:Settings->Display, gestures & buttons->Navigation button backlight\nBy default, this option is set to Auto off when inactive but you can change to Always on when the screen is on.Motion gestures\nHTC U11 supports few motion gestures on the lock screen and double to wake up is one of them. One of the other useful motion gesture is swipe down twice to launch the camera.

This means app shortcuts feature is available in the U11. This is similar to iPhone's 3D touch where a long press on the app icon reveals different shortcuts available for that app.\nNavigate to the home screen and long press an app icon that supports app shortcuts, like the Twitter app. This will reveal the app shortcuts. You can even drag and drop the app shortcut from that shortcuts list to your home screen.Cast to Chromecast or other DLNA/Miracast devices\nWith a simple three-finger swipe up gesture, you can share your entire screen with Chromecast, DLNA or Miracast devices.Quickly add widgets to your home screen\nWith a simple pinch and close gesture, you can directly navigate to the Widgets screen where you can choose to add widgets, apps, and shortcuts to your home screen.Customize app drawer background\nYou can apply your favorite background to the app drawer.

HTC is calling this the Edge Sense. In the video below I go through the steps to setup Edge Sense and also show you different options available to customize the Edge Sense to your specific needs. \nWhile setting up your HTC U11 for the first time, you will also be prompted to configure the Edge Sense feature. Once configured, the default action for the squeeze gesture will be set to launch the camera app. To activate the Edge Sense feature, you just squeeze the phone edges. As the squeeze gesture registers, you will get both a visual and vibration feedback. \nSqueeze harder and you will launch the camera app. You can squeeze again to take a picture. Very handy shortcut indeed to take a picture quickly. \nTo customize the Edge Sense feature, navigate to:Settings->Edge Sense\nHere you can turn on or off the feature completely as well as customize the various options available. \nTo change the default action, that is, launch the camera app, just tap on the Customize squeeze action and select your desired action.\nYou can also adjust the squeeze force level to your desired level by tapping the Adjust your squeeze force level option.\nOnce you have set your desired squeeze force level, you can test to make sure you are comfortable with the squeeze.\nWhile the basic mode provides you with a single squeeze gesture, you can enable the advanced mode where you can have two - a short squeeze and a squeeze and hold - gestures. Now, you can configure two shortcuts for these gestures respectively.\nThe squeeze action also works from the lock screen and when the display is off. However, you will have to unlock the device if you are launching an app instead of basic shortcuts like turning on/off the flashlight from the lock screen or when the display is off. \nOverall, I do find the Edge Sense useful to launch my favorite shortcuts. This is yet another way to launch your favorite apps. After using this feature for a while, it feels natural to squeeze your phone and there is no doubt I will using this more often than I thought to launch my favorite shortcuts.

I have been excited about this phone as I believe HTC has finally made a great flagship device, unlike their previous attempts.  \nUnboxing the U11, you will find the following in the box:\n- HTC U11 Phone\n- HTC Fast Charger\n- USB Type-C cable\n- HTC USonic Earphones with extra ear buds\n- 3.5mm headphone jack adapter\n- Clear case\n- Dust cloth\nAs far as the specs go, the HTC U11 is equipped with:\n- Snapdragon 835 processor\n- 5.5 Quad HD Display\n- 16 MP Front Camera (for those awesome selfies!)\n- 12 Ultra Pixel Rear Camera\n- 3000 mAh Battery\n- Android 7.1.1\nIt is available in three colors here in the US:\n- Amazing Silver\n- Brilliant Black\n- Sapphire Blue\nThe Sapphire Blue is my favorite color though I also like the Amazing Silver.\nOnce you have gone through the initial setup steps such as logging into your Google account, you are greeted with configuring the Edge Sense feature. \nThis will help you to adjust your squeeze force and train yourself to squeeze. Depending on how your hold your phone, this gesture, squeezing the sides of the phone, could be natural for some or weird for the rest initially. \nOnce that is configured and you have set up your fingerprint sensor, you are greeted with the home screen. This is HTC Sense, HTC's Android skin. I quite like HTC Sense as it has very little customizations over Android and you almost get the same experience as you get in a Google Pixel.\nSince the HTC U11 is running Android 7.1.1, you get app shortcuts on your home screen. This is similar to the 3D Touch in iPhone. Just long press the desired app icon on your home screen to see the available shortcuts for that app.\nNext up, I plugged in my USonic earphones and HTC prompted me to create and configure my personal audio profile. U11 will scan the surroundings and will create a unique profile for you. You can have multiple audio profiles and switch between them as needed.\nI love HTC BoomSound and the U11 doesn't disappoint. The sound coming out of the speakers is loud and clear. You can also switch between a normal music mode and a theater mode which basically tunes the stereo effect for those respective modes (music and theater). I talk about the BoomSound at about 7mins in my video if you want to check out how loud and clear the sound is.\nHere is a quick comparison between the U11 and the Samsung Galaxy S8. At the back, the reflective liquid glass surface of the U11 does stand out when compared to the S8. However, in the front, the S8 has a curved, almost edge-to-edge screen display while the U11 has a flat screen with the bezels as you would expect in a normal smartphone. \nAnd, here is a quick comparison between the U11 and LG G6. At the back, there is no doubt U11 shines with its liquid glass surface. However, in the front, G6 has a flat, almost edge-to-edge screen display just like the Samsung Galaxy S8.\nWhile some may argue about the bezels at the top and the bottom in the U11's front, they actually host the HTC BoomSound speakers underneath those bezels putting them to a good use while both S8 and G6 have single speakers that cannot stand against the BoomSound.\nHTC U11 has Google Assitant built-in and also supports waking up the phone with the Google keyword. Once you have configured the Google Assistant, you can simply say - Ok Google - even when the screen is locked to start interacting with the Assistant.\nAnd yes, HTC will be adding Amazon Alexa with an update soon. So, you can then choose between the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, which is cool!\nI am really excited to use the U11 as my daily driver and I will be back with more videos, tips, and tricks for the HTC U11.

In this video, let's look at the different ways to take screenshots like a pro with your Samsung Galaxy S8: Capturing screenshots\nYou can capture a screenshot either by:\n- Holding the power key and volume down key together for a few seconds, or,\n- Do a palm swipe gesture over the phone\nYou can enable the palm swipe gesture under:Settings->Advanced features->Palm swipe to captureEditing screenshots\nOnce you have captured the screenshot, S8 provides various editing tools to annotate the captured screenshot. You can either open the captured screenshot from the notification window immediately after taking the screenshot or locate it under the Screenshots folder in your Gallery app.\nJust hit the Edit option to start editing your screenshot. You can annotate your screenshot with stickers, labels and even draw on the captured image.Scroll capture\nSometimes, you may need to capture several pages in a screenshot. You can do that using the Scroll capture option. Immediately after taking a screenshot, tap the Scroll capture option at the bottom which will now take another screenshot by scrolling the app.Smart select\nThe smart select edge panel offers various quick options to take screenshots. You can add the smart select panel under:Settings->Display->Edge screen->Edge panels\nTap the Edge panels to add the smart select panel.\nWith the smart select, you can capture specific regions of your screen in the following shapes: Rectangle and Oval. \nYou can also extract the text from the screenshot content which is very cool. Very useful if you just want to share the text instead of the image (SMS vs. MMS).\nYou can also pin a screenshot to the top of your screen. This is useful if you want to refer the contents of the screenshot in a different app. \nFinally, the Animation option helps you create a GIF from a video. This does not record your screen though, just helps to create GIFs from existing videos. \nTo create a GIF with this option: Play your video, open the smart select panel, tap the Animation option and choose the area you want to record. Then hit the record and stop accordingly to capture the GIF.Go to URL\nThis is an amazing feature where taking a screenshot of a web page from a browser app also saves the source of that web page as one of the options so you can later visit that page from the saved screenshot. \nThis works in any browser app, whether you are using the Samsung Internet or Chrome browser app. If you open the captured screenshot, in the bottom bar, you will see the option Go to URL which will open the captured web page in your browser.\nAnd that's how you take screenshots like a Pro with your Samsung Galaxy S8!\nFor more Samsung Galaxy S8 How-Tos and tips, you can subscribe to my YouTube channel here and follow the Galaxy S8 playlist here.", "time": "05-30-2017 12:43 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5843211", "text": "Nice, thanks.

I\u2019m going to work on shooting some more video (higher quality and with different equipment).

If so then look no further than the SURFACE case. What You Get\nThe case comes in a big cardboard box with a cutout so you can see the beautiful case and a flap to cover about 2/3 of the front. You can buy this case both with and without the kickstand, although, SEIDIO charges a lot for the kickstand separately, so, I would strongly recommend that you buy the case and kickstand together if there\u2019s even the slight chance that you will use it. This case is offered in black, blue/gray, red/black, and tan/black. Protection\nThis case has a dual layer design, with an inside layer being TPU, and the outside layer being polycarbonate. Additionally, it has a Hexguard Technology on the inside of the TPU layer which adds more shock protection in the event of impact. It should be noted that the face has a small lip, which doesn\u2019t give a lot of face drop protection. This case doesn\u2019t have a certified drop rating like the SEIDIO DILEX case, but it is also much slimmer and lighter, and should be adequate for most people using it for normal situations.Fitment, Feel, and First Impressions\nThe overall thickness of the case is just 2mm, which is the slimmest fit of any dual layer case. On some dual layer cases, the second layer doesn\u2019t cover certain portions like the corners, but this is a true dual layer case, with both layers covering the entire phone.\nWhat\u2019s somewhat unique about this case is that you can use the inside TPU layer as a slim TPU case in and of itself. I should be clear that while most dual layer cases can be used with just the inner layer, SEIDIO actually designed this case in such a way that it actually looks like a standalone case. This could be nice for those who just need a very light duty case sometimes, and a case with more moderate protection at other times. And, the outer polycarbonate shell can be removed without removing the inner TPU case! \nThe case feels comfortable in hand, and I was able to rest my pinky finger under the fps, which makes it a little more secure against slipping out of the hand. The exterior of case itself provides a little grip, and has a soft-touch coating. \nThe SURFACE case features a zinc-alloy magnetic kickstand for multimedia viewing in horizontal mode only. The kickstand sits in a slot when closed, so it won\u2019t snag on anything. It does require a significant force to open, which is good so it won\u2019t accidentally open if it snags on something.\nAll the holes and buttons are well aligned, and require a moderate force to press, so as to help avoid accidental presses in the pocket. The buttons are in the inner layer, and are slightly recessed from the exterior surface. \nThe holster is secure, yet I am still able to remove and holster my phone with one hand. You can holster the phone vertically, horizontally, or virtually any angle that you may desire. This holster does not have any lock mechanisms, however, the SEIDIO DILEX holster does have locking mechanisms, should you need that feature. Why should I buy it?\nThis case is for someone who wants a well featured case, including ultra slim dual layer protection, metal kickstand, and holster.

Lots of protection with a metal kickstand and holster? If so then look no further than the DILEX case. What You Get\nThe case comes in a big cardboard box with a cutout so you can see the beautiful case and a flap to cover about 2/3 of the front. You can buy this case both with and without the kickstand, although, SEIDIO charges a lot for the kickstand separately, so, I would strongly recommend that you buy the case and kickstand together if there\u2019s even the slight chance that you will use it. This case is offered in black, blue/gray, and red/black. Protection\nThis case is certified for a 6 feet impact drop protection, and has raised corners as well as a dual layer design. Additionally, it has a \u201cSignature Hexguard Technology\u201d on the inside of the TPU layer which adds more shock protection in the event of impact. It should be noted that while it has a small lip which protects the phone while facing down, the same small lip isn't going to give a lot of face drop protection. Fitment, Feel, and First Impressions\nThe case is a bit thick at 3.6mm and features a dual layer design with a flexible TPU inner case and hard shell polycarbonate outer. It also feels a bit heavy, but that is to be expected for very heavy duty back and side/corner protection. This is the preferred design for dual layer cases as it has the softer surface directly touching the phone. The case feels comfortable in hand, and I was able to rest my pinky finger under the fps, which makes it a little more secure against slipping out of the hand. The case itself is moderately grippy, pretty standard for polycarbonate back cases\nThe thickness of the case makes the fingerprint scanner a little hard to access using the left hand without touching the camera. This isn\u2019t a problem using the right hand though. \nThe DILEX features a zinc-alloy magnetic kickstand for multimedia viewing in horizontal mode only. In the horizontal orientation, the volume buttons aren't accessible. You can lift the phone up slightly and press the buttons, but it is a little inconvenient. SEIDIO claims that it is indestructible. While I haven\u2019t done any destructive testing, it does feel very solid, and it didn\u2019t bend when I applied significant force to it. The kickstand sits in a slot when closed, so it won\u2019t snag on anything. \nAll the holes and buttons are well aligned, and require a moderate force to press, so as to help avoid accidental presses in the pocket. \nThe holster is very secure, yet I am still able to remove and holster my phone with one hand. You can holster the phone vertically, horizontally, or virtually any angle that you may desire. It also has a lock for the holster angle as well as a lock to lock the phone inside the holster.Why should I buy it?\nThis case is for someone who wants a rugged case that offers good drop protection, an \u201cindestructible\u201d case mounted kickstand, and a holster. The corners are also beefed up to help against corner drops. If you are looking for this combo, then this case is really the best that you will be able to find.

If so then look no further than the SEIDIO OPTIK case! It feels like a regular TPU case, but it has enhanced raised corners which should provide better drop protection than standard TPU cases. In the past, I have bought Ballistic cases which had this design, however, they don\u2019t have any cases for the S8/S8+. Major props to SEIDIO for stepping up to the plate to provide a case with raised corners! \nIn addition, a small but overlooked item would be the fingerprint scanner (FPS) which is partitioned off from the camera. What You Get\nThe case comes in a basic red cardboard box and a plastic bag to hold the case. Nothing special, but gets the job done. \nProtection\nSEIDIO decided to add raised corners, so it should have good corner protection, which is a big plus over regular TPU cases. However, there isn\u2019t very much face drop protection, as the corners are raised just ever so slightly on the face. Fitment, Feel, and First Impressions\nThe case feels like most TPU cases \u2013 it is smooth and provides great grip, but it should be noted that it could get a little slippery if you have oily fingers, though the same can be said for other TPU cases. Regardless, the case definitely makes it significantly less slippery than a naked S8+. SEIDIO states that the case is 2mm thin, and it seems about right. I would consider it to be a medium thickness TPU case. \nThe inside back of the case has a dot matrix design which is done so that the inside of the case doesn\u2019t \u201cstick\u201d to the back of the phone, and on the plus side, it looks pretty nifty! This case is also somewhat unique in that it provides different slots for the flash, camera, and fingerprint scanner (FPS). This design really helps to align your finger with the FPS, and avoid getting smudges on the camera! \nAs a disclaimer, I kept the stock back plastic on my phone, which is probably the reason why the mic holes are slightly misaligned. Aside from that, all the buttons are well aligned, and require a moderate force to press, so as to help avoid accidental presses in the pocket. Why should I buy it?\nThis case has two stand out features - FPS cutout and the added corner protection. For me, the biggest downside of the S8+ is the placement of the FPS which is hard to locate and also causes accidental touches on the camera lens, and this case really helps in that regard. The corners are also beefed up to help against corner drops.

It is long and there is no TL;DR version.What is the Jamstik+?\nThe Jamstik+, made by Zivix LLC, is an update to the original Jamstik. This is a product I've known about since the original Jamstik and just haven't had the opportunity to play around with yet. The Jamstik+ is essentially a miniature guitar with five frets, though it is so much more than meets the eye. To start with the Jamstik+ uses real guitar strings. Yes, real guitar strings and it's amazing. The strings are double strung, meaning the there are two ball ends of the strings, one ends at the headstock, and the headstock is stubbed just long enough to allow for the ends of the strings. These strings also don't react quite the same way as they do on a standard guitar as they are intentionally kept taught except over the frets. This is accomplished using the faceplate at the base of the fretboard. I'm not going to lie, as a guitarist myself, picking on taught strings was a little weird to get used to at first. \nAt the base of the body, you'll find the pickup just before the Jamstik+'s unique bridge, which serves as a string guide through the body of the Jamstik+. Just past the bridge, you'll find one of the few buttons on the device, this particular button is a mute button which will mute all the notes that are currently ringing. On the bottom of the Jamstik+, you'll find the microUSB charging port/connection port, the battery charging indicator light, and a 3.5mm jack. Moving to the back of the Jamstik+ you'll find the cutouts for the included guitar strap and the battery compartment. In the battery compartment under the battery, you'll find an Allen key for adjusting the string tension, and the second ball end of the proprietary Jamstik+ guitar strings. Finally, on the top of the Jamstik+, you'll find the power button and status indicator light as well the menu button and D-pad. The D-pad is used to change the location of which five frets you are playing on, the octave you are playing in, and more as the buttons can be mapped depending on what application you are using.\nI said the Jamstik+ was so much more than meets the eye, that's because you can connect to your Android or Apple devices using Bluetooth and you can even connect to a PC, which may be necessary to use the USB cable. Now currently Zivix LLC does not have any of their apps available for PC, however, that is not an issue for the Jamstik+. I'll delve into the Jamstik apps a little later on, suffice to say they are designed for learning rather than an experienced guitarist. An experienced guitarist is going to be more intrigued by the Mac and PC options because the Jamstik+ isn't just a Bluetooth capable miniature guitar, it's also a MIDI controller. This allows the Jamstik+ to be a much more useful tool for a musician. For example, the Jamstik+ can be used to play any instrument within Apple's GarageBand, it is also useful for the Guitar Pro application. One of the things that excites me the most about the ability to use the Jamstik+ with Guitar Pro is that Guitar Pro will write out the music as you are playing it. \nIt is also worth noting that the Jamstik+ requires Bluetooth 4.0, Android 6.0/6.0.1, Windows 10, Mac OSX 10.10, iOS 8, or later to work. There is a list of known compatible devices on the Jamstik website including starred devices that are known to work without issue on those devices. So what is the Jamstik+? The Jamstik+ is essentially a musician's electronic Swiss army knife, so let's get into it.Usage/Opinions\nBeing a guitarist myself, getting used the Jamstik+ was no issue at all. It is a little weird only having five frets, no headstock, and mini body. There are some things I wish the Jamstik+ could register, like palm muting. Palm muting is a technique that is exactly like it sounds, you use the fleshy side of your palm to mute the strings as you're playing them and is pretty much a requirement for rock and metal music as it gives that distinctive chugging sound while playing. The other weird part to get used to is being forced to fret everything 100% properly due to the infrared sensors under the fretboard. On a regular guitar, I can play just fine, however, if I play the same way on the Jamstik+ my fingers may activate the infrared sensor by being too close to the fretboard. It may be weird for me but it is absolutely great for new players to help them learn how to fret everything properly. I never found anything that didn't work like it should, only things I need to work on myself. \nI spent some time on the phone with a product specialist from Zivix to be sure I understood everything well enough for this review, and one thing I was told was that as long as you connect the Jamstik+ via the Jamstik+ app and don't close out the app your Jamstik+ connection will transfer over into other apps. The only time I saw this not work properly was on Android, though to be fair, I am using a phone that isn't on their list of phones known to work properly with the Jamstik+. That being said, that was the only issue I ran into and all I had to do was turn off the Jamstik+, turn back on, and reconnect in whatever app I was using. One of the most amazing things about the Jamstik+ is how responsive it is, you get real-time response over Bluetooth which is incredible. \nI am a self-taught guitarist, which means I skimped on a lot of things I shouldn't have. It happens with self-taught musicians of all types. The JamTutor app is a great tool for beginners and people like myself who skimped. Being able to have real-time feedback during the lessons really helps with learning proper technique and fixing the things I skimped on. For me, that means proper finger placement and usage, timing, chord changing, and not looking at the fretboard while I play. The apps also offer a host of other information that is really great for learning and they are things I didn't spend a lot of time learning when I should have. To have all that information available to someone who is just learning how to play guitar truly is indispensable. So what is all this great information? And the tools? Let's take a look.The Apps\nI mentioned that Zivix LLC makes a few apps specifically for the Jamstik+ and now I'd like to dig into those apps. There are four main apps that you can download to get started with your Jamstik+. These apps are Jamstik+, JamTutor 1, JamTutor 2, and JamMix (Apple only, Mac version needs to be downloaded from the Jamstik website). Each of these apps offers something a little different. JamTutor 2, for example, is as you would expect, an extension of JamTutor 1. The JamTutor apps are designed with the intention of getting you started playing guitar. Don't worry if you haven't played before, the lessons were designed to teach people who have never played before. The Jamstik+ app is a really great playground app giving you access to multiple instruments, tunings, chords, and scales. JamMix is a fun app that will allow you to create your own backing tracks using preset audio tracks for various instruments within a particular style and then lets you play along with it. Simply put, Zivix makes some of the best learning tools I've ever seen, and they just happen to be in easy to use app form to boot. Now let's jump into these apps which I have included screenshots and screen recordings of from the iPad app. Although all the mobile apps look the same, there is some slight variance for the Mac apps.Jamstik+\nAt first glance, the Jamstik+ app would appear to be a very basic app without much functionality, and you would be wrong. The Jamstik+ app is essentially a virtual guitar textbook. When you open the app you are presented with the main screen that shows the fretboard, a chord identifier, sounds menu, and a few other options. There is a store for different sounds and there are a good number of free downloadable instruments and a few paid ones as well. There is a help button in the top right that will bring up text boxes telling you about everything on the screen. This can be very useful until you familiarize yourself with the app. Also in the top right corner you'll find the settings, which will allow you to browse info on the Jamstik+ and more settings, frequently asked questions, the sound store, a list of compatible apps, Jamstik news, a toggle to allow the Jamstik+ to play in the background, and a toggle for notifications. Then in the upper left hand corner, you will find the select a Jamstik+ option to connect to a Jamstik+.\nIn the Jamstik+ settings, you can do a lot more minute customizations. Going down the settings you can choose to reset the Jamstik+ to default settings and choose the sleep timeout time. Under those settings, you have MIDI settings which lets choose whether or not to use single MIDI channel mode, change the MIDI channel of the first string, and change the minimum and maximum velocity of the MIDI. Then in the general settings, you can disable all the MIDI velocity, adjust the controller, threshold, pitch angle, and enable/disable the accelerometer. Next, you have picking settings, these allow you to adjust the string hold time, enable/disable the volume curve, and adjust the level for the volume curve flattening log. Moving along to the fretboard settings, you can choose to enable/disable sustain, string bending, left-handed use, hammer-ons/pull offs, hammer-on velocity, and tapping mode. You can also adjust the amount of the time you have to tap the strings for hammer on and pull offs adjusting by milliseconds, default settings require quite a fast finger to use hammer-ons and pull offs. Finishing out the settings you have the tuning settings. Here you can actually fine tune your Jamstik+ by transposing the current tuning, which will shift the notes higher or lower, and you even set the frequency of the strings individually. It's worth noting that these settings follow the Jamstik+ regardless of what device you are using. \nIn between the live chord diagram and sounds menu, you will find two buttons. The top button opens up a chord library and will show any chord you select on the fretboard for you to practice. The lower button also brings up a library, this time a library of scales, and just like the chords, the scale you select will be presented on the fretboard for you to practice. Now on the right side of the screen, you have more options available. The top option is for the D-pad, and on a smaller screen this icon may look like a flower. When you open up the D-pad options you will see the current functions of each of the buttons. If you select the arrows next to a function of a button you can change the function to a different one from the list that opens. The next option is for tuning. The icon is a tuning fork with sound waves emitting from it. In this options you can see the current tuning of the Jamstik+ and selecting the arrows next to the tuning will bring up a list of tunings to choose from. You will also see what frets are currently active on the Digital Capo section and you can manually change them simply by pressing on another section of the fretboard. Underneath the Digital Capo section, you have the Octave section, which will show you what octave range is active in relation to the tuning, and you may select to go either up an octave or two, or down an octave or two. \nThe next option is for pick intensity, indicated by a pick with a starburst in it. In this menu, you are shown all six strings with a dot on a line for each string. There are some options above the strings which are Custom, Minimum which is blue, a green, a yellow, and Maximum which is red. Selecting one of these changes where the dots are on the string lines, as well as changes the Trig and Boost levels which are to the right of the string lines. For the custom setting, you can adjust the Trig and Boost levels manually. These adjustments actually adjust the amount of force required by you to hit the strings with before the Jamstik+ will register that you hit the string. Moving on we have the accelerometer options, this icon is a circle with three arrows going in different directions from the center. These options allow you to turn the accelerometer on or off on the Jamstik+, select the MIDI controller number (if necessary), and set the maximum and minimum pitch angles. The final menu is indicated by a checkbox. These options allow you to turn on or off string bending, tap mode, single channel, and hammer-ons/pull offs.\nAs I said, the Jamstik+ app is much more intensive than it initially appears. All these options allow you to really play around with the Jamstik+ at your pace and is a fantastic learning tool. From having large chord and scale libraries to learn from and the ability to see what you're playing and get real time chord names as you're playing, the Jamstik+ app is certainly a great tool to help with your playing. Especially if you're like me and didn't take the time to learn many chords and started playing your own, the Jamstik+ app will let you know what those chords are. As basic as it seems on the surface, don't discount this virtual textbook. JamTutor 1\nI would consider the Jamstik+ app a passive learning tool and JamTutor 1 is an active learning tool. Upon opening JamTutor 1 you are brought to the main menu, on the right side is where you will find an option to connect to a Jamstik+ if you are not currently connected, and if you are it will show which Jamstik+ is connected. On the left side of the main menu at the bottom, you will see two options, a plus symbol and a set of gears. The plus symbol will bring up an option for more lessons, and the gears bring you to your main options for the app. In the main options, you can adjust the volume output of the Jamstik+, reset your lesson data, view controls, and connect a Jamstik+. Under the view controls option, you will be presented with a front and side picture of a Jamstik+ as well as a list of all the buttons and what they do within the JamTutor app.\nBack on the main menu going up from the bottom you have the Open Play option. This is very similar to the Jamstik+ app in that you can select chords and scales to display on the fretboard and practice and it also has a chord identifier. In the lower right corner, you have a settings option which brings up the menu to change the instrument you are playing, bring up a help menu, and return to the main menu. Above Open Play in the main menu you have Arcade Mode, if you've ever played Guitar Hero you'll be familiar with how Arcade Mode operates. When you choose Arcade Mode you are showed a list of the lessons you can choose from to play, and when you select a lesson it will take you into Arcade Mode and will ask if you want to play Normal or Practice. Normal mode will score you on your playing just as Guitar Hero does and Practice mode will wait for you to hit all the right notes before progressing any further without scoring you. This is great when you are just learning how to play and need more time to get your finger placement correct and to work on changing chords faster. Arcade Mode also has a settings button in the lower right corner which gives you the options to restart the song, end the song, change the instrument you are playing, bring up a help screen, and return to the main menu.\nMoving on up the main menu, you have Challenges. Challenges is an extension of the lessons where you can practice what you learned in a more fast paced environment. Instead of having the lesson to guide you, you only have the highlights on the fretboard that you have to follow along with. This is another great tool to help with finger placement and speed. Once again the settings button here is in the lower right corner and will allow you to change the instrument you are playing, bring up a help menu, or return to the main menu. This brings us to the coup de gr\u00e2ce, the purpose of the JamTutor app, the lessons. When you select the Lessons, you are again shown a list to choose from. The lessons are done in a great way. There is a small amount of text occasionally, however, the bulk of the lessons are video and you follow along with the videos. Every other part of the lesson brings up the fretboard to play with and the others take you into Arcade Mode. I find this to be a very effective way to engage a new guitar playing as having them focus their attention on the screen helps keep them from spending too much looking at the fretboard while playing. This is another fantastic tool for learning. JamTutor2\nThere's not a lot to say about JamTutor 2 because it works exactly the same as JamTutor 1. The only difference is JamTutor 2 has fewer lessons and they are more advanced lessons than the lessons in JamTutor 1. Following the same layout of JamTutor 1 makes JamTutor 2 just as essential and useful of a tool for learning.JamMix\nThe JamMix app is another great tool for learning how to play along with various styles and instruments. When you open up the JamMix app you need to select a song (a style), and there are seven to choose from. The songs you can choose from are Electronic Vision, Unleash the Beat, Pump it Up, Dub Grinder, Free Flow, Hit the Floor, and BluesJam. After you select your song, JamMix will load up the instruments for the song and you set your own backing track, which is the Mix part of JamMix. You have five presets to choose from on each of the six instruments for each song, and playing a fret on a string will start the prerecording for the instrument that is associated with that string. Playing a different fret will change the preset, and playing the open string will turn that instrument off. Above the instrument section, you have three more options to toggle on delay, high pass, and low pass. When any of these are active you can manually adjust the response by dragging the purple dot around the box to the desired response. \nOnce you've dialed in a backing track you're happy with, then you can choose the Jam button on the right hand side of the screen, and from here you can select which instrument you want to play with and you can start playing along. There is even an option to turn on OneFinger Chord under the Jam button, which will allow you to play chords with a single finger. On the left side of the screen, you have a Jam volume, or Mix volume slider, depending on which section you are in, to adjust the volume of either one. At the very top of the screen, you can see what song you're playing under and can change the song touching on it. To the right of the song it will show you the BPM of the song, and to the right of the BPM, you can see which Jamstik+ is currently connected. In the upper right hand corner you have the settings button, and just like all the other Zivix apps, this will allow you to bring up a help screen or return to the main menu.\nLet's say you're like me and don't get to jam with other musicians often, let alone musicians who play different styles and speeds; then the JamMix app becomes another indispensable tool to help with playing along to styles and speeds that don't match your own as well getting you more familiarized with playing along to other instruments. It's also a lot more fun than just playing along to a click track or metronome to help with playing in time.  But wait, there's more!\nYes, there are even more apps that you can use the Jamstik+ with because it is a MIDI controller. For this section, I'm just going to list some of the others apps that work with the Jamstik+ by platform. These apps all work using Bluetooth MIDI input, or even direct connect via USB on Mac. All these apps offer a host of sounds and functions to create all kinds of sounds and using the Jamstik+ plus as a MIDI input device with them is perfect for a guitarist to play synthesizers with. These apps range from free to upwards of $50 or more, so take a look at them and check out some reviews if you're interested in them. The Android side is a little hit or miss due to the open nature and ever changing nature of Android and as apps either add or remove Bluetooth MIDI support things can change quickly. On Android, I will list a couple apps and a developer whose apps usually work with the Jamstik+ and for any other apps, you just need to search MIDI and try some out.iOS \u2022\tGarageBand\n\u2022\tFourchords\n\u2022\tSample Tank\n\u2022\tNovation Launch Key (iPad only)\n\u2022\tNave (iPad only)\n\u2022\tGeoshred MIDI\n\u2022\tSunrizer (iPad only)\n\u2022\tArctic Keys\n\u2022\tAnimoog\n\u2022\tiSEM (iPad only)\n\u2022\tCubasis 2 (iPad only)\n\u2022\tBeatHawkMac \u2022\tAbleton\n\u2022\tProtools\n\u2022\tLogic Pro X\n\u2022\tReason\n\u2022\tAcid Pro 7\n\u2022\tGuitar Pro 7 (USB only)Android \u2022\tWalkBand\n\u2022\tiGrand Piano\n\u2022\tiLectric Piano\n\u2022\tFL Studio (developer)Conclusion\nIn the end, the Jamstik+ is so much more than just a Bluetooth mini guitar for learning how to play guitar. Even using just the apps made by Zivix, an experienced guitarist can still learn more and have a great practice tool in their pocket and backpack. With the Jamstik+ being a full-fledged MIDI controller though, the possibilities of what you can do with it are nearly endless. You can connect to many apps that allow MIDI input, whether it be on a phone that accepts Bluetooth MIDI input, or a computer that accepts either Bluetooth or USB MIDI input. For a guitarist, the functionality within Guitar Pro is absolutely amazing. Guitar Pro will register what you are playing on the Jamstik+ like a real guitar and if you are writing out music in Guitar Pro all you have to do is play it on the Jamstik+ and Guitar Pro will write it in as you play. With the future of MIDI changing quickly, a device like the Jamstik+ will absolutely be a device to have. It is already a beast in its capabilities and those capabilities will only continue to expand. So the real question, is it worth its $300 price tag? I would have to say absolutely. Just the tools Zivix gives you themselves are worth the price tag, but all the other apps you can use to create content with the Jamstik+ make it a virtual steal. You can buy the Jamstik+ in a few different color options directly from Zivix on Jamstik.com. One more note, the Jamstik website currently shows the Jamstik+ at $280, I'm not sure if it's a sale or a permanent price drop, either way, now is the time to buy.", "time": "05-15-2017 11:35 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5825402", "text": "Added the rest of my screen shots.", "time": "05-23-2017 11:46 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Mint Sim Review", "thread": [{"postID": "post5757529", "text": "Mint Sim reviewPros\n-Great pricing if you are willing to commit to 3 months or more.\n-Phone calls and texts work greatCons\n-There are times when data performance just randomly lags.\n-The introductory pricing is only good for first time customers. When you renew, you will have to do so at current pricing.Introduction\nYou might be wondering what is Mint Sim? Well, Mint is a sub-brand of Ultra, which is a T-Mobile MVNO. What is an MVNO you might ask? Quite simply, it means that the carrier has no physical network, and rides on another carrier\u2019s network, in this case, T-Mobile. Keep in mind that by going with Mint Sim or other MVNO, that you are not getting all the perks of being a T-Mobile customer like their international data, roaming capabilities, T-Mobile Tuesdays, and what not. BUT\u2026the price\u2026Oh yes the price. The beauty of Mint compared to many other pre-paid plans is that you will get a discount the longer you agree to commit to service, either 3 months, 6 months, or a year. If you are one to change carriers more frequently than 3 months, then Mint won\u2019t be for you. To help get you started, Mint has an introductory pricing at 3 months of unlimited talk and text and 2gb high speed data for $35 or $11.67/mo (regular price is $69 or $23/mo). But if you are willing to commit to one year then the regular pricing is $16.58/mo. Also, keep in mind that tax isn\u2019t included in the price. \nI had used MetroPCS (which is owned by T-Mobile) about six months ago, and the performance was somewhat lacking compared to Verizon at my desk at work. I should also say that I work in a high rise amongst multiple high rises so the load on the towers in my area can be very high at peak times. I saw Mint come out, and figured, what the heck\u2026$35 for 3 months service. Not much to lose. I already have Verizon on the legacy unlimited data plan, and can\u2019t get it back if I dropped the plan, so I decided to use it on my Pixel XL (unlocked Google version), and leave the Verizon sim in my other phone. Setup\nSetup was straight forward. The provided pamphlet guides you through the activation process, porting your phone number (optional), inserting your sim (the provided sim has perforations, and can be punched out for a mini, micro, or nano sim), and setting up the APN. After doing the activation process, I didn\u2019t have to do any setup at all, I just popped in the sim and everything worked fine. Although, depending on the phone, you may have to set up the APN settings (instructions are in the pamphlet provided with the sim for both Android and Apple devices)Performance\nCall and texts including picture messages worked great. Never a dropped call or an unsent message. But on to what people really care about \u2013 DATA!!! Overall, I was very impressed with the speed tests \u2013 they were for the most part better than Verizon, which was unexpected. I suspect that the introduction of the new Verizon unlimited data is causing data speeds to go down as I was getting significantly faster speeds on Verizon just a few months ago. My current legacy plan also isn\u2019t network optimized, so that isn\u2019t it, just pure load. Back to Mint, performance seemed to be a little inconsistent \u2013 even immediately after getting a good speed test, I would sometimes struggle to open a web page. This could be an issue with the Mint sim being de-prioritized over T-Mobile customers, or something with the connection itself as sometimes, simply turning airplane mode on, and off again, will get things going. Keep in mind that most of the time, things like browsing, YouTube and Netflix went smoothly, but occasionally, there were some hiccups. Keep in mind that I am on the Mint 2GB plan, so I used video only sparingly. On a side note, you can type in #932 # into the dialer to see how much data you have remaining. Once your allotted data is up, then you will go to 2g speeds which is very very slow. Also, you don\u2019t have to worry about speed tests eating up your data allowance on Mint as they don\u2019t count. \nVerizon\nMintConclusion\nSo the question you are having now is \u2013 is it worth it? I would say for the price, absolutely. It is aggressively priced if you are willing to make a commitment from 3 months and up, especially at the one year mark. Sure it has a few hiccups here and there, but if you are looking at Mint sim, then you are looking for a bargain basement pricing, and as such, you will have to deal with the occasional problem here and there. If you are using it a lot and demand the best performance, then you would probably be better off with one of the big 3. However, I think this is great for someone who uses the internet somewhat sparingly and can accept some hiccups. And even if you aren\u2019t sure, switch for 3 months \u2013 for $35 total.

This is that device.\nPreviously, he was using a Microsoft Lumia 640 as a Wi-Fi-only device and while he could have kept using that, I thought we could take advantage of Cricket's heavy discount of 100% on the Galaxy Amp 2 and try it out. \nIs this device the one? Debatable. \nBut does it get the job done? Yep.\nCan you beat free with a number ported? That\u2019s hard to do.\nBut in replacing the heavily discounted $30 AT&T 640 of 2014/2015, the Amp 2 has its work cut out for it.CONTEXT\nThe Galaxy Amp 2 is a Cricket-exclusive 4G/LTE-capable smartphone that fills the bargain-bin slot of Samsung's Galaxy lineup. Launched in late March/early April of 2016, the Amp 2 (J120AZ) appears to be stable-mates with the 2016 Galaxy J1 and the AT&T Galaxy Express 3 from what I could tell from my research online.The Samsung Galaxy J1, Express 3 and Amp 2. The Daewoo Kalos, Pontiac G3 and Chevrolet Aveo of smartphones.HARDWARE\nThe Amp 2's design is typical Samsung and would feel right at home next to a Galaxy S 4 or S 5. It's exterior is strictly matte plastic. The midframe is silver and the back cover is a darker shade of grey. It certainly does the job it's tasked with performing without feeling particularly high-quality. One can\u2019t complain much on that since the point of this device is value first and foremost.\nOn the face of the device is the standard pre-Galaxy S8 layout. A 4.5-inch 480x800 \u201cSuper AMOLED\u201d panel sits above the centered physical home key with the usual recent apps and back soft buttons on both sides just like other recent Galaxy phones prior to the S8.\nI actually thought the display was an LCD at first glance and while it\u2019s perfectly serviceable, it\u2019s reflectivity and sharpness won\u2019t set your world on fire, even if adjusted for price. \n(If you\u2019ve handled the \u201cClearBlack\u201d LCD on the Nokia Lumia 635 which has a similar screen size and resolution at 480x854 @ 4.5\u201d, you\u2019ve been spoiled.)\nAt 480x800, the apparent non-RGB stripe subpixel arrangement (likely PenTile) isn\u2019t doing the screen any favors although viewing angles and outdoor visibility is decent. \nMinor detail, but you have the option to adjust the display saturation, color temperature, etc. if that's your style.\nLike the Lumia 635 though, there is no ambient light sensor on this phone so brightness control is strictly manual. This phone does include a relatively unique \u201cOutside\u201d mode (a checkbox next to the brightness slider) to compensate slightly; but it doesn\u2019t do much else than increase the brightness to a level better suited for direct sunlight viewing for 15 minutes however. UNDER THE HOOD\nOn the inside of the Amp 2 is a quad-core processor clocked at 1.3 GHz flanked with 1 GB of RAM. Not impressive, and arguably not adequate, but when subsidized for as much as it was and standing by itself, I can let this one slide.\nSpecifics aren\u2019t the most forthcoming but it appears the aforementioned badge-engineered models are equipped with Samsung\u2019s Exynos 3 Quad 3475 chipset. GSMArena lists \"Spreadtrum SC9830\" on it\u2019s page for the 2016 Galaxy J1.\nOnboard is 8 GB of flash memory, with the official specifications pegging available space at just over 3 GB. You\u2019ll want to take advantage of the phone\u2019s microSD slot if you plan on capturing any amount of photos or installing any more than a moderate app loadout.\nThe Amp 2 has a 5 megapixel rear camera (with an LED flash and autofocus) which produces shots that range from mediocre to poor in decent lighting. Budget Lumia\u2019s have led me to believe cameras in this price group have improved markedly, but it appears to not be the case here. \nThis is but one device in a large category with a large number of contenders however, and I suspect that the slightly larger and better equipped Amp Prime could very well be the better buy. I don\u2019t expect to have hands on experience on it anytime soon so that will remain speculation on my part. For reference, the Amp Prime has a 5\u201d 720p display, 8 MP rear camera, 2600 mAh battery and appears to correspond with the 2016 Galaxy J3.\nThe front camera is a 2 MP unit. Eh.\nWi-Fi is 802.11 b/g/n at 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth is version 4.1.\nThe battery is a moderately-sized, removable 2050 mAh pack. Battery life has not been thoroughly tested as of press. There are more extensive Samsung power saving options onboard however that I find quite interesting. https://www.androidcentral.com/using...sung-galaxy-s5\nAn accelerometer and proximity sensor are on-board. No surprises there.\nOverall, it's not a bad package, but the question is whether it makes the right compromises for potential owners.SOFTWARE\nRunning the software show is Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. That's not bad considering its both nowhere near alone in running Marshmallow today and it's budget-minded nature.\nWhat concerned me most initially was whether it would see security updates going forward but so far my concerns have been tentatively allayed. \nIt was purchased in late-April/early-May of this year and was on the January 1st, 2017 security patch level which also isn't horrible.\nAs of press, it has since received the April and May 2017 security patches, which is reassuring.\n(I believe both patch levels were dated the 1st of the month, but I cannot confirm when these builds were pushed.)\nIt remains to be seen how much more it'll get in updates and news coverage of this device is circumstantial at best. But I'm tentatively optimistic. It isn't going to compete with Google or BlackBerry in relative consistency and speed, but in the grand-scheme of the Android market, you could do worse. Don't hold your breath for Nougat though.\nOn top the adequate Marshmallow platform is Samsung's TouchWiz customizations with its own theme and unique features.\nSamsung\u2019s take on Android on the low-end is fairly light with effort put into smaller features and skinning the OS. The default launcher is the \"TouchWiz Launcher\" and beyond that and TouchWiz\u2019s graphical skinning , we\u2019re left with Samsung\u2019s built-in apps and some small features that I have not seen elsewhere to date, but Samsung veterans are probably no stranger to the plethora of preinstalled applications and options.\nAlso a minor note but this phone has a Cricket boot screen, which isn\u2019t inherently bad, but it comes with a distinctive startup sound, which I am not a fan of.CONCLUSION\nAt free with a number ported, I can easily justify the Amp 2. Beyond that, I'm not sure I can. \nIt\u2019s hardware just isn\u2019t impressing me like Nokia/Microsoft and Motorola did with their budget phones not too long ago. But to be fair, Microsoft has all but pulled out of mobile. Lenovo-owned Motorola is still cranking out phones at all price points though, so they'll be something to definitely keep an eye on. As far as software is concerned, you can do a LOT worse in this segment.\nGalaxy Amp 2. If you fit into the promotion audience and are on a shoestring budget, it's competent.\nMost will probably want to look a bit more upmarket though.Galaxy Amp 2.

These phone cases come along once in a lifetime, and live in a world that most people never see, hear, touch, or even dream about\u2026 and then a company like Cover-Up comes along and creates a magnificent phone case that is available for $31 or less, that not only pairs well with most bourbons and scotch, but also feels appropriate to raise your pinky while holding it. Price \u2013 Currently, $26.00 - $31.00 (various wood/designs) \u2013 free shipping on all USA orders. Background \u2013 \nWelcome to the #WoodBack Case, by Cover-Up.A hand finished real wood cover, combined with a protective polycarbonate snap case, perfectly formed to fit your iPhone 7 Plus. The natural wood grain and texture makes every case unique.\nI\u2019ve been using phone cases since the iPhone 3 \u2013 even back during the dark ages of gel cases that came off all the time when you pulled them out of your pocket \u2013 and never in my life did I think about the idea of blending a polymer case with a sheet of wood built in it; well Cover-Up did \u2013 mind\u2026blown. Cover-Up has broken the mold with this winning combination of various wood backings that are sure to impress most people, and have others looking up \u201cCarpathian Elm Burl\u201d when you get done talking. The Look \u2013 Straight out of the box, the craftsmanship and design of this case will surely impress you. Normally I\u2019m a minimalist when it comes to protection, opting for cases that provide adequate protection but don\u2019t really break up the form factor of the device\u2026 and then the #WoodBack case came along. I have to be honest here\u2026 I was sold when as soon as I heard the word \u201cmahogany,\u201d but there are various different types of wood that you can purchase, ranging from rich mahogany, to Carpathian elm, walnut, and many more, representing the full spectrum of different woods from light to dark, making it easy to pair for most any occasion.The Feel \u2013 The wood is seamlessly blended in with a solid polycarbonate chassis, which snaps sharply onto the phone. I was a little worried at first that it would obstruct the feel of the phone, but having the solid wood backing almost makes it feel like an extension of the phone. It has a very balanced weight to it, and doesn\u2019t\u2019 feel cumbersome. As you can see from the pictures, the top and bottom of the case are left bare, allowing for a natural feel of the device, and it also leaves your speakers and charging port unimpeded, for ease of access. The Texture \u2013 The wood finish is of course naturally a little slick, but no more than the actual phone finish itself \u2013 less slippery, actually. However, the polycarbonate edging will keep it from sliding on any imaginable surface. The case texture is a bit grippy, but this is nice because it helps to bring out the quality craftsmanship in the design, and it also helps to prevent slips or drops. Carrying the phone is pleasant because it puts emphasis on the areas that you\u2019re holding the phone instead of covering the entire area in a grippy or plastic surface. Ease of Access \u2013 One of the first things that you will likely notice after you install the case is that the power button access throws you off if you\u2019re used to traditional cases that cover the button. I was using a Ringke case prior to this that covered the power button with the TPU material, creating a larger button press area, so when I switched to the #WoodBack , it took me a day or two of getting used to reaching a little higher for the button. If you\u2019re used to carrying your phone sans case, then it shouldn\u2019t present any problem for you at all. One other thing you may have to get used to is the port access on the bottom. If you\u2019re used to using a protective case, usually it\u2019s pretty easy to plug your charger in in low-light conditions, or without looking. It took a little practice getting used to trying to plug it into the charging port with no guiding cut-out around it. Again, shouldn\u2019t\u2019 be an issue for non-case users. I do need to highlight that these are not actual problems. It\u2019s just an observation that I had when switching from a full-enclosure case to this more open design. Protection \u2013 On a scale of 1-10, I\u2019d say that this phone comes in around a 6. It provides a rugged exterior that will protect from side and surface impacts on the backside, but the open case design of the top and bottom leaves the surface area exposed. Always, always, always, make sure that you put some form of screen protector on your device \u2013 especially something as expensive as an iPhone 7+. As everyone knows, the phone is not waterproof. It has an IP rating of 67, versus the IP 68 rating of the S8 and other waterproof devices. It is water resistant, but if you\u2019re looking for a case that provides more than normal splash and impact resistance, you\u2019ll still want to look at other manufacturers such as LifeProof and OtterBox. The #WoodBack is more of a lover, than a fighter. Its design is geared much more towards up-scale class and craftsmanship, than taking a splash in the pool. Summary \u2013 I think it\u2019s apparent at this point that I recommend that you buy this case. If you own a suit and a tie, this case is a must-have for business trips, dinners, and the professional environment. If you\u2019re looking for something that stands out from the crowd and looks elegant, this phone case is perfect for most any occasion. It may not be the end-all, be-all case that you use 365 days out of the year, but it certainly merits a nice place on your desk to snap on when the occasion arises; however, it also works very well for a daily driver. I will be using this as my primary case for the foreseeable future, and I gets high marks on all of the features I look for in a phone. Classy, rugged, impressive, and doesn\u2019t disrupt the overall feel of the phone. Recommendation \u2013 Buy, buy, buy! P.S., and buy! Pros:\n-\tLooks sharp!\n-\tLooks great for any occasion, and really takes your phone to the next level in professional environments\n-\tProvides adequate protection but doesn\u2019t disrupt the look and feel of the device.\n-\tThis phone is the definition of premium.

I would often go without a case and my time with the BlackBerry Priv was no exception. However, in the light that I have found it nigh impossible to find a suitable glass screen protector for it\u2019s curved display, a case becomes even more important. Can Seidio solve my case commitment issues? Stay tuned\u2026Seen with the BlackBerry official \u201cSlide-out Hard Shell with Stand\u201dUNBOXING\nThe Surface Combo is dubbed the Combo because of the bundled belt holster included in the package alongside the Surface case. Whether I\u2019ll be using it remains to be seen. Regardless, I will comment on it.\nThe Surface Combo came in a reasonably appealing and recyclable clear plastic package. Opening it, as per the instructions, was rather difficult though until I manipulated the product inside slightly and out of the way of the buttons.\"PUSH IN + PULL UP\"\nI appreciated that it did not require the use of scissors or otherwise needing me to manhandle the packaging as some plastic packaging tends to demand. (I\u2019m looking at you AT&T GoPhone)\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Seidio currently sells this case in your choice of red, blue, or black.\nFor comparison, I will be referencing BlackBerry\u2019s official \u201cSlide-out Hard Shell with Stand\u201d which I have owned for a bit.THE MECHANICS\nTo accommodate the Priv\u2019s sliding nature, and like other cases for this smartphone model, the Seidio Surface is in two pieces that attach and slide together mechanically. A snug back holds onto the rear and a rectangular frame is slid/snapped into place and surrounds the display.\nThe bulk added is minimal but noticeable if you\u2019re as picky as I am, and dimensions are virtually identical to BlackBerry\u2019s solution save minor differences in shape. The case also adds extra friction to the slider. It's not a big deal, but its enough so that you can leave your Priv halfway open if you so desire.\nA difference I noticed between both cases is that BlackBerry\u2019s case has a rubber strip placed on the front frame that would be contacting the top of the device\u2019s display. This makes for a frame that better stays in place when slid open but also slightly bulges out awkwardly.\nSeidio\u2019s Surface case does not have anything there which means the case is flush with itself when shut. (Can be seen above) When the keyboard is extended however, the reason for BlackBerry\u2019s rubber addition becomes apparent and the top part of the frame feels loose.\nFrankly, I prefer Seidio\u2019s cleaner lines and if this begins to truly bother me I will enter DIY territory and add some double-sided tape. I could likely remove the rubber on BlackBerry\u2019s case as well and do the same. I don\u2019t think most would care significantly about either issue though.\nHowever, a bit more significant are the buttons on the Surface. They are oddly loose. They aren\u2019t about to fall out by any stretch, but they wobble back-and-forth more than I\u2019d like. I don\u2019t notice it during normal use but it\u2019s still a negative. I see that it\u2019s how they were installed but would have preferred more solidity. The buttons are a hard plastic. It's like the materials were inverted from BlackBerry's case actually which featured a hard plastic exterior with more rubberized buttons.The volume and mute buttons as seen from the inside.THE KICKSTAND\nThe slightly-raised silver SEIDIO plate on the lower-back isn\u2019t just for style, it doubles as a magnetic kickstand. A much more elegant solution to BlackBerry\u2019s, which involves the flexing and snapping of plastic to stay open or closed. (which frankly makes me feel like I am breaking something)Here are the two cases in action. BlackBerry's on the left, Seidio's on the right.\nMuch less elegant though, is this kickstand\u2019s effectiveness. It\u2019s much smaller physically and using it feels much more precarious. The Priv with the Surface donned feels like it\u2019s balancing on the kickstand and its opposite corner more often than not, and setting it up on an airplane\u2019s tray table saw more minute shaking than I would have liked. Touching the display corner opposite of the kickstand normally doesn\u2019t knock over the phone, but it moves and wobbles. \nIt can\u2019t be used in portrait orientation either. Attempting to do so will simply result in the phone falling on it\u2019s back.BlackBerry's case stands tall in this case. Seidio's? Not so much.\nBut does it work? Despite the aforementioned issues, it does stay up in landscape mode and otherwise sufficed while I tried to catch up on Frank Underwood\u2019s political machinations and Leslie Knope\u2019s park-related antics.\nA word of warning however, I tried this case with a Qi wireless charging stand and while it did appear to charge, the metal kickstand became worryingly hot within minutes. It wasn't entirely unexpected but it leaves me knowing that wireless charging and this case are mutually exclusive. This may be the deal-breaker for me, but considering that not many people use wireless charging, this is likely a non-issue for most.THE FINISH\nThe case\u2019s exterior is soft touch. If you\u2019ve handled the soft touch lid finish on a ThinkPad, you\u2019ll be right at home. I know I\u2019ve called the Priv\u2019s back \u201csoft touch\u201d (or will, since this will beat the Priv review to press.) and they\u2019re not too different in feel. It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s very smooth, and I\u2019m a sucker for soft touch. The packaging advertises it as a finish that does not attract lint or dust and that appears to be the case, pun not intended. I\u2019ve noticed that dust tends to accumulate on the Priv\u2019s speaker grill right below the case\u2019s display frame however.\nThe case\u2019s inside is also soft touch, except for a large black rectangle of what I presume is velvet. I won\u2019t be feeling it during use but my phone certainly will. Does it make a difference? No, but it\u2019s still a nice touch that\u2019ll treat the Priv\u2019s back cover well.THE HOLSTER\nIf you\u2019ve seen the case, you\u2019ve seen the holster. Hard non-soft-touch plastic with a mostly velvet interior. You can place the Priv both facing out and facing inwards, but facing in is what it was intended for to protect the display. The velvet makes a lot more sense here now that it\u2019s making display contact and you can also tap into some cool auto-wake/sleep functionality.\nIf you\u2019ve used BlackBerry 10 with a holster or pouch, (or have an iPad with a smart cover) you\u2019ll recognize this. Placing the Priv into the holster automatically put\u2019s it to sleep and removing it automatically wakes it. I could reasonably see foregoing the use of the power button most of the time with this holster.\nThe holster has a spring-loaded arm that holds the Priv in well (and you can just click the Priv in without manually raising the arm.) and I don\u2019t see that wearing out over time or otherwise slipping. The belt-clip also rotates and it has not given me any reason to worry about it either.\nYou can technically put the Priv into the holster naked, but it\u2019ll fall out with any amount of shaking, so don\u2019t do it. Differing corner designs also means that BlackBerry\u2019s Shell case doesn\u2019t fit, but to be fair, neither were designed with the other in mind.CONCLUSION\nSeidio\u2019s Surface combo has a lot to offer here. It\u2019s soft-touch finish feels high-quality and it\u2019s build feels as solid as anyone would want in a case. It\u2019s held back a teeny bit by it\u2019s fiddly buttons and a lot more by it\u2019s lackluster kickstand, so decide how important a kickstand is for you. \nIt\u2019s not for me so I can easily overlook it, but if you like to prop up your Priv in various spots to watch Keanu Reeves kick butt onscreen or bang out a report in Word, this may not be for you. What I can't overlook so easily is the wireless charging issue, but its importance is also up to you.\nThe holster won\u2019t blow anyone away, but it\u2019s smart integration and velvet interior make it about as good of an option as it gets.\nBut for the rest of you that won\u2019t mind its shortcomings and want a high-quality case and holster, this is it.\nIf it counts for anything, the Seidio Surface has only been removed from my daily driver Priv for review photos and comparisons. And it certainly saved it from a nasty faceplant onto the metal floor of a plane.\nThe Seidio Surface case is available on both Seidio\u2019s website and CrackBerry\u2019s store for just about $27-30 standalone as of press time. Of course, these may change. \n(\"Garnet Red\" is currently out-of-stock as of writing)\nThe Holster is about the same price but is also available as just a $10 addon, which is of course the better deal if you want to keep your Priv on your hip.TL;DR - Solid build, minimal bulk, comfortable soft-touch finish, smart holster with a cool-but-lackluster kickstand.

Let\u2019s be honest, nothing is better than holding your phone naked. After all, who likes to use protection? Not me for sure. But the alternative for not using protection on your phone could be disastrous for those with OCD. I sought out to find what is the best option for the absolute MINIMAL case for protection from scratches. BOOM! Peel comes to the rescue! Think about it \u2013 at 0.35mm, this is about as thick as four pieces of paper! That\u2019s thin!Background\nMany case manufacturers make a variety of cases, but not so with Peel. They strictly focus on making minimalistic cases. As with most phone case manufacturers, they started with the iPhone, but slowly branched out to other phones. Recently, they made a case for the Pixel and Pixel XL, and offered me a case to try as part of the Community Review Team. I have heard of Peel but I was thinking to myself, how good can it be? I have used other minimalist cases before and was never really impressed. What You Get\nThe case comes in a basic white cardboard box with foam material protecting the case. On the back of the foam material is the guidance on how to install the case (just pop the bottom on first, then pop the top on. Fitment, Feel, and First Impressions\nWhen I got the case, I was like\u2026this feels very flimsy\u2026will probably throw this in my pile of junk cases, but since I already committed to doing a review, I figured, what the heck, let\u2019s try it on \u2013 and boy am I glad that I did! Although it felt flimsy in the hand, it fit like a glove on the Pixel XL! The case has a textured feel that provides a little grip, though not as much as smooth TPU cases. But regardless, it is way less slippery than a naked Pixel XL! My Quite black one is a translucent smoke black color, and compliments the black Pixel XL very well. For the Pixel XL, you are limited to black, silver, and blue for now. As a disclaimer, I do have a skin on the back of the case, so some of the buttons, particularly on the sides where the skin is, are slightly mis-aligned. The top and bottom holes were there is no skin align up well. This shouldn\u2019t be a problem if you do not have a skin on your phone.\nThis should be obvious, but this is a minimalist case. The case just barely covers the back and sides. There is no face protection, however, you can add a screen protector if desired. The good thing is, due to how minimal the case is, any screen protector should fit. Also, this case would provide minimal protection for falls. But really you are buying a minimalist case \u2013 and this is as minimal as you can get. All the other minimalist cases that I have used didn\u2019t feel as minimalist as this one! And yes, there are cheaper minimalist cases, but this is a really high quality case \u2013 If you want the best of the best, then this is it.Why should I buy it?\nThis case is perfect if you want something to protect against bumps and scratches when in your pocket from keys, change, sand, diamonds, gold bullion\u2026you get the idea. But aside from being thin, it also feels like a high quality product, not some flimsy case that you can pick up for a few bucks. What are you waiting for?

Just because you haven\u2019t dropped your smartphone doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. If you want bare-minimum, ultra-thin protection for the body of your phone, Peel\u2019s Super Thin Case is for you.About this review: via the Mobile Nations Community Review Team, Peel sent over a Very Silver case for me to review. This is not fake review.\nTaking the case out of the box, I had an initial impression of the material feeling flimsy but that\u2019s because it\u2019s so thin. Ridiculously thin. Snap it onto the Pixel and that impression goes away immediately. It fits snug but I had no issues taking this case on and off.\nFit and finish are near perfect. Cut-outs for mics and buttons and the charging port appear tight and as close as they could be. It looks like they were made with a bit more precision that other cases. Unlike thicker cases, as your reach around for the hardware buttons there\u2019s no uncomfortable sharp edges poking at your fingers or palm. \nThere are two features are missing from my personal list of features I want in a case. I prefer my cases to employ a lip design for the front as an added extra layer of protection for when I lay my phones flat on their face. Peel\u2019s design does not have this. In addition, to me the Peel case doesn\u2019t feel like it adds any significant grippiness over using the Pixel without a case. With the case on, the Pixel could slip out of my hand just as easily. \nBut that said, this case is so thin that it feels like there\u2019s no case on it at all. And if you\u2019re looking for minimal protection, that\u2019s what you want with a case like this. \nPeel\u2019s bread and butter is support for the iPhone so it\u2019s nice to see support for Google\u2019s flagship Android smartphone. I hope this leads to Peel supporting other key Android devices.\nThis case is available in three different colors - complementing the Pixel\u2019s Very Silver, Quite Black, and Really Blue. They\u2019re transparent enough to see the glass window and Google logo behind it. And unlike other cases, Peel\u2019s logo is nowhere to be found on the case itself - if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. \nAt just 0.35mm thin, Peel\u2019s Super Thin Case for the Google Pixel is an excellent option for those that want minimalist protection.

As part of the Community Review team, I have had the pleasure of testing out and showcasing Peel\u2019s Pixel XL case. It\u2019s a refreshing product that stands out from the competition, and leaves me interested in trying more of them! Price \u2013 Currently, $24.99 plus shipping. Background \u2013 Peel is relatively new to the phone case scene, starting out about 4-years ago with the mission to create a quality, but minimalistic device case (according to their website). Their mission was to make a case that didn\u2019t ruin the good looks of the phone, but still offered solid protection from bumps, scratches and light drops. I believe that they have accomplished these goals. The Look - The Peel case was surprising out of the box. At first glance, it does seem a little thin, and even bendy whenever I was trying to put the phone into the case. However, once I got the case installed, it fit like a glove. There is definitely more than meets the eye with this case. It may appear thin, but it utilizes a solid surface density concept which creates it\u2019s strength from the form fitting design, coupled with a tough exterior. If any of you have ever dreamed of having a phone skin that also protects the phone, this is definitely for you. We aren\u2019t living in 2014 anymore, and many companies have shied away from the giant, bulky cases of old. Peel takes it to the next level. The Peel case comes in at an amazing 0.35mm of thickness, which makes it feel like it\u2019s part of the phone. There is no added weight, or form modifying density, just pure form fitting goodness! Also, they come in a wide variety of colors!The Feel \u2013 Honestly, you can hardly tell it\u2019s there. One of the great features that I like is that it\u2019s slightly translucent, and it doesn\u2019t have any branding on it. Peel believes that \u201cminimalism is beautiful\u201d, and so do I. Phones already have manufacturer\u2019s logos on them, plus carrier branding\u2026 it\u2019s nice to have a case on the phone that helps the form factor to stand out, and doesn\u2019t throw another label on it. Extra branding makes me feel like I\u2019m carrying around a minivan during the presidential election \u2013 no more bumper stickers! Additionally, it\u2019s refreshing and welcoming to have a case that doesn\u2019t hide the physique and feel of the device. For too long, I\u2019ve had phones that are gorgeous and have a great design, only to be hidden under millimeter after millimeter of rubber and plastic. I really love the approach that Peel has taken with its cases. Also, as you can see, the volume and power buttons are easily accessible.The Texture \u2013 There is a bit of a texture to the case. It\u2019s not grippy, but it does a heck of a lot better than the soap bar finish on the Pixel XL, itself. I\u2019m a guy, so naturally my hands are kind of dry, so this only amplifies the slickness of most devices. The first thing I do when I get a device is have a screen protector and a case ready to go. It was still a little more slippery than I prefer, but other people who checked it out said that the texture was nice, so you may or may not like it. All in all, it definitely won\u2019t get stuck in your pocket, but I wouldn\u2019t put your phone in any compromising situations that may encourage it to take a nosedive. Protection \u2013 The protection that the Peel case provides is excellent for surface protection and abrasion, but don\u2019t play Frisbee with it. The minimalistic approach is great for form factor, but it compromises on impact and drop protection. It will survive anything that the phone would survive on it\u2019s own, minus the scratches and abrasions. However, it\u2019s no Otterbox or LifeProof case, so be careful \u2013 as you should. It\u2019s an $800 phone! However, from my experience and encounters, the finish on the Pixel XL is naturally not very resistant to wear and tear, so this is a huge upgrade! You can feel safe using the Peel case as a daily driver, and for casual protection of the phone\u2019s exterior.Summary - All in all, I love this case! It\u2019s classy, it shows off the phone, and it protects it. Will it protect it from falling bricks or meteors? No. But you don\u2019t have to worry about your car keys, Mentos, or loose change causing damage to the phone surface. The caveat to this, make sure you put a screen protector on the device as well. If you\u2019re going to take the steps to protect your device, spend the extra couple of bucks and throw a nice tempered glass screen protector on it. You\u2019ll thank me, and you\u2019ll thank yourself in the long run \u2013 End Public Service Announcement (PSA). Moral of the story; if you want a case that doesn\u2019t feel like a case, is great for professional and casual situations and doesn\u2019t obstruct the use or physique of the device, I highly recommend checking out Peel\u2019s selection of cases, especially for the Pixel XL.Recommendation \u2013 A solid buy!Pros:\n-\tLooks sharp!\n-\tMinimalistic approach provides quality protection and doesn\u2019t sacrifice form factor\n-\tIt\u2019s great for professionals because it slides right into coat and pants pockets, and it just looks classy.\n- Provides surface protection from normal wear and tearCons:\n-\tN cheap, but not expensive \u2013 It\u2019s definitely not a budget case\n-\tNot much protection from drops\n-\tThe texture is not as grippy as some, but it\u2019s better than the phone\u2019s natural finish.\n-\tNot available for all devices \u2013 limited to Pixel/Pixel XL, iPhone, and iPad (Air and Mini)\nGo check out Peel\u2019s selection of fancy, low-profile cases at https://buypeel.com.

Having a dedicated button just to launch Bixby doesn't make any sense right now. There is still more of Bixby to come. Until then this seems like nothing useful.Fingerprint sensor placement and shape\nWhether we love it or hate it, the fingerprint sensor is in an odd place, right beside the camera. This makes it harder to reach and no wonder you hit the camera lens instead. The shape is also odd, unlike the universal circle or square shape we have seen in other smartphones, which makes it harder to place your finger completely. Video aspect ratio\nSamsung's screen aspect ratio is 18.5:9 which makes watching videos with bezels. Videos are usually in the 16:9 aspect ration and thus when you watch videos full screen (landscape mode) in S8, you will notice the dark bezels on the sides. Edge lighting\nIf this feature works, it will be one of the coolest features of S8. However, right now the Edge Lighting only works with the default messages app and for call notifications.

Or maybe you have the same love/hate relationship with aluminum body phones as I do. Here's the thing about aluminum body phones, they look great, they look amazing. However...most of the time they are smooth, which means a lack of texture, and a lack of grip. The easiest way to fix this issue is to buy a case for your phone. Luckily the Moto G5 has a few options available despite being a budget phone, and the great part about that is that even the cases from the big name brands also come at budget prices. In this case, we're talking about Spigen and the Rugged Armor case for the G5 Plus. \nThe Rugged Armor is a rubberized TPU case with ever present Spigen design inside the case. I like to call it globe lines. On the back of the case at the top and bottom, you have some faux carbon fiber portions that accent the black of the body nicely. Aside from that, the case is a smooth matte black broken only by the Spigen logo on the back. As is the case with Spigen (pun intended), all the cutouts are done perfectly, and the buttons on the case itself are as smooth as can be adding some nice tactile feedback. The headphone jack and charging port cutouts are large enough that you can use whatever headphones or charging cables you want. There is even a nice lip over the front of the phone to protect your screen from drops and let's you place your phone screen down without concern.\nThe Rugged Armor's rubberized TPU is soft and adds a great level of comfortability to your G5 Plus. Where before the G5 Plus felt slim and slippery it is now soft and grippy. While the case itself is very light, once it is on the phone it adds a small amount of weight that feels just right. Having this added weight and grip makes the handling of the G5 Plus so much better than it is without a case. It's a night and day difference. Unfortunately, due to the smooth matte black of the case, all the grease, all of it, will show.

In my brief time with this case, I have come to enjoy the slim profile it provides with precise cut out to the fingerprint sensor which makes it a ton easier to reach the fingerprint sensor due to its awkward position. \nWhat I like about the case:\n- Sleek and slim design\n- Easy to put it on and take it off\n- Doesn't add much weight\n- Precise cut outs for the camera and the fingerprint sensor\n- Good protection for the corners\nWhat I don't like about the case:\n- Printed logo at the back\n- Very little protection for the screen\n- Not much protection from drops except for the corners\nThe best feature of this case is the precise cut out for the fingerprint sensor. Many cases just have one big cut out for the flash sensor, camera, and the fingerprint sensor. However, SEIDIO, instead of having a single cut out, the OPTIK case has three cut outs - one for each. This makes it really easy to reach to the fingerprint sensor without any difficulty.\nThe ports align perfectly with precise cut outs.\nIt is easier to reach the buttons without any difficulty and the case gives a good firm feel for the buttons.\nWhile there is protection for the corners, there is hardly any protection for your screen drops.

Following up from last year's R1 device, BLU has made some substantial improvements on the outside and under the hood, combining some quality new features and amazing battery life into the new R1 PLUS. Over the past few weeks, I have had the pleasure of working with BLU to do an in-depth review and test drive of the R1 PLUS. While this isn't the typical mainstream device such as the newly released LG G6, and Samsung S8/S8+, BLU takes a step in a different direction, making its own mark within the mobile device industry. BLU stands for Bold Like Us, and I feel like \"bold\" is a really good way to describe some of the features that are available in the R1 PLUS. Where most mainstream flagships will run you $500-800 USD, the BLU R1 PLUS breaks away from this and provides a quality unlocked device for $159.99. While it lacks a fingerprint scanner and biometrics, it makes up for this with a sharp 720p display on a 5.5\" IPS LCD, with subtle curves, dual-SIM support and a 4,000mAh battery - try killing it in one day. I dare you! Without further ado, let's dive deeper in to the R1 PLUS and what makes it a unique and affordable offering in the budget phone arena.Specs:On the Surface:\nOut of the box the R1 PLUS is running a pretty stock version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which is fairly standard for economy-tier devices. I did reach out and speak with BLU and they have informed me that 7.0 Nougat is planned for the device, but the date is not available yet. The interface appears unaltered, featuring the app drawer, as well as the pre-installed Google search bar. The traditional swipe-down gesture will get you to the notifications menu, with a second swipe pulling down the entire quick menu, and settings button. The R1 PLUS does come with Opera\u2019s browser installed as the default browser, but the device also comes with a complimentary Google folder, which already has Chrome installed. The R1 PLUS does support active wallpaper. I did give one or two of the default ones a try. They work, but they definitely aren\u2019t as smooth as I\u2019ve seen on higher performing devices. Also, daydream features are available \u2013 remember, daydream features will not show unless you allow the display to turn off on its own. If you manually turn off the display, the daydream features will not work. Last but not least, as is common with Amazon coupled device sales, the Amazon store app and a few other amazon apps, such as Amazon Video, Amazon Kindle, and Amazon Music, come pre-installed \u2013 one disappointing thing is that you cannot uninstall them if you want to. I am unsure whether the Best Buy variant will have the same apps pre-installed. Device Construction:\nBLU definitely pulled out a few stops in the design and crafting of this device! The device comes in one color, Gun Metal Grey. Out of the box, It\u2019s evident that BLU put extra time and effort into boosting the overall appearance of the phone, giving it a much more premium feel than its predecessor. The frame is solid and has a good weight to it, at 191g, and measuring 153 x 76.6 x 10.5mm. It's also constructed out of aircraft grade aluminum! The power button is conveniently located on the right-side of the phone, and the volume rocker is located just above it. Ease of access for the device buttons is quite nice, and the case that comes with the phone does not encumber the operation of them at all. The 3.5mm headphone jack is located on top of the phone, and the USB 2.0 power connector is on the bottom. Under the Hood:\nOne of the strongest selling points for the R1 PLUS is the massive 4,000mAh battery. With new 2017 flagship devices such as the HTC U Ultra sporting a 3000mAh battery, and the LG G6's 3300mAh battery, the R1 PLUS is far and away one of best offerings you can get for battery life, especially for a budget device. The R1 PLUS utilizes a MediaTek 6737 Quad-Core processor, clocked at 1.3GHZ, and it has a Mali-T720 GPU to handle the display. Over my time using the device, I found that it is quite capable of powering through most day-to-day activities, and even some moderate multi-tasking and gaming. I can't even compare it to upper-tier Systems-On-a-Chip (SoCs) because that wouldn't be fair; the R1 PLUS is in a different class entirely, and geared towards a different environment. However, the CPU is well-suited for performance and power management, lasting well over an entire day with the 4000mAh battery combination. Honestly, I think one of the strongest arguments for this phone was made by my 7-year-old son. I let him use the phone to play some games in the car while we were driving out of town, and afterward, he wanted to trade me his iPhone SE for the R1 PLUS, because \"the battery last so long.\" Another surprise offering in the R1 PLUS is an enormous 3GB of RAM. I'm sure a few people might get a laugh out of the usage of \"enormous\" for describing 3GB of RAM, but I have to put this in context. Where else are you going to find a notable phone manufacturer that sells a $150 phone that has not only a 4000mAh battery, but also sports 3GB of RAM? Good luck with that. BLU did a great job in my opinion, ensuring this phone is well-equipped with enough quality specs to be considered a solid, economical daily driver, and a more than ample back-up phone, for those of you who like to carry multiple devices. The R1 PLUS also raises the bar for budget conscious devices, with an included 32GB of storage space, which should be more than enough for everyday use and even moderate picture/video taking. However, it also supports MicroSD storage up to 64GB, in case you need extra space for larger videos or a library of hi-res photos. Display and Resolution:\nThe screen is a well-equipped 5.5\" HD curved glass display made from Gorilla Glass 3, with a 720x1280 (720p) display and 267ppi resolution. Is it 4k, or 1080p HD? No, it certainly isn't... but the trade-off here is a solid unlocked device that powers you through the day and then some, especially when it's tailored to support reasonable graphics, and performance. The curved aspect of the screen isn't functional like the more common curved displays of Samsung's flagship devices, but the subtle curve at the edge does allow for easier holding and enhances the form factor of the device; largely, its more aesthetic than anything, but a nice novelty for this tier of device. One nice surprise for me is that I found the display to be very reactive and accurate, especially when typing. I do more texting and typing than anything on my phone, and having the Gboard keyboard already installed, combined with a well-implemented key spread, really helped out with accuracy right out of the box. As I used the device, I really didn't pay too much attention to the fact that the resolution wasn't higher because that wasn't really my expectation going into it. Another aspect of the screen that really impressed me was the viewing resolution and crispness of the pictures that I took with the device. There is a little lag between clicking on the picture and full-res display, but the color balance and image sharpness are very enjoyable. The R1 PLUS also handled video playback well, including streaming media such as: YouTube, Netflix, and other video applications.Cameras:\nThe R1 PLUS has a 13MP f2.2 aperture main camera with built-in LED flash, and a 5MP front-facing camera. One of the bold moves that I was referring to is the front-facing flash that BLU has decided to install in the R1 PLUS. Not only does the camera take good selfies, but the flash brightens things up for low-light environments and really helps you showcase your pearly whites. The main camera also comes with a nice surprise. Even though the phone resolution only supports 720p, the video camera will record in full 1080P, at 30fps - this is a great feature if you're into uploading video or enjoy using your phone to shoot video clips. Overall, I was very happy with both cameras, and even impressed by the quality of the images, especially on the 720p screen. Here are some photos that I took with the device. I tried taking a bunch of pictures in different area and lighting locations to give a good spread of what the rear-facing camera is capable of. One of my favorite built-in enhancements is the availability to switch between the front-facing and rear-facing cameras by a simple swipe gesture. If you swipe down from the top part of the screen, it switches back and forth between the two cameras \u2013 it\u2019s very smooth and convenient.Speaker and Sound Quality:\nThe R1 PLUS breaks from one of the popular norms of 2016, and has chosen to locate the speaker on the back of the phone instead of installing a downward driving speaker (I'm quite happy about this). If you're a sound enthusiast or like to watch videos on your phone, the R1 PLUS is a real winner here because the natural placement of your hands on the phone acts as a directional support for the speaker, channeling it back around to the front, whereas downward facing speakers are very easy to cover up and get muffled when holding the phone. The overall volume of the speaker is pretty solid. The lows and highs are ample, but the mids do seem to be a little underrepresented as the volume goes up. You don't have any trouble hearing it, but the subtlety is noticeable at times. Depending on the quality of the sound output, highs can also be a bit tinny at times on full-volume. However, it doesn't detract from the overall experience of whatever you're listening to. HD audio sources really help to create clarity in whatever you're listening to. As far as call quality goes, the volume and clarity are perfectly good; I have no complaints at all, whether talking directly into the handset or using speaker phone.Headphone Jack:\nOne feature that should make a lot of people happy is that the R1 PLUS still has a 3.5mm headphone jack. 2016/2017 has brought us several devices already that no longer support the headphone jack, which is unfortunate. However, BLU understands that a lot of people in the world still love to use their headphones and don't want to use a converter or toss their old headphones out for Bluetooth compatible accessories just to listen to music/video - this is definitely a positive feature of the phone. On a different note, the R1 PLUS does not come with ear buds, you'll need to supply your own.Connectivity:\nThe R1 PLUS is designed and well-equipped for the U.S. Market, sporting a wide variety of 3G and 4G LTE bands: Most notably for T-Mobile and AT&T users - Bands 2, 4, 7, 12 and 17 - be aware that the device is unlocked, and will only operate on GSM networks. Also, as I noted above, the R1 PLUS is a dual-SIM phone, which allows you the capability of operating two different SIM cards in the device at the same time (this is a huge PLUS for a lot of business professionals and international travelers). Beyond cellular connection and data, the R1 PLUS also sports Bluetooth 4,0, of course Wi-Fi, and can be used as a wireless hotspot. Accessories:\nOne of the nice surprises you will get when you open the box is a screen protector, cleaning cloth and protective sleeve - I wish more manufacturers did this. My number one priority when I get a new device is to dress it down with a screen protector and case as quickly as possible. BLU's forethought in this area is much appreciated and helps to ensure that your shiny new phone is safe from the get-go. The included case and screen protector aren't LifeProof or Spigen quality, but they are more than adequate and will work for normal use, or as a stop-gap until you have a chance to order aftermarket accessories. The screen protector is a classic peel-and-stick, which offers quality screen protection. Additionally, the R1 PLUS comes with a standard USB charger and charging cable (it's USB v2.0; and is not quick-charge). Overall Performance: \nThe overall performance of the phone is pretty darn good, in most regards. If you\u2019re used to an octa-core processor with 4gb of RAM, you\u2019ll definitely be able to tell a difference. This is not a flagship level device, and it certainly isn\u2019t trying to compete with them. But, for most casual users, the appearance and operation of the phone will be a pleasant experience. For some more intensive programs it takes a second or so longer to load, but that is to be expected with a budget phone utilizing a quad-core processor \u2013 it\u2019s not a multi-tasking beast. The areas you will notice shuddering or slow-down is during loading phases and graphics rendering, whether that\u2019s loading an app or while transitioning between one app to another. Once the application is running, it runs fairly smooth. Also, one thing that I noted and brought to the attention of BLU, and the development team is the multi-touch interface sensitivity/execution on the screen. I did receive confirmation that the screen supports 5-point multi-touch, but if you try to use certain games or apps, you will notice that the multi-touch is below par. In some instances, it is frustrating, and inconsistent to pinch-and-zoom, which was a turn off for me. It did seem to work better for simple browser and picture operations, but in real-time environments and non-OS related applications, it seemed to have difficulty. I am unsure whether the inefficacy is software or hardware related. However, I will say that the model I received is running a copy of the OS from December of 2016, and I was not able to get confirmation on whether it was the final design model, so the quirks may have been worked out of it on the release device. This is a cautionary note if you plan on running certain apps or games that require multi-touch response, such as zooming or sustained screen pressing. On a positive note, it runs Fruit Ninja like a champ! See included image. Pros:\n-\tBattery Life\u2026 I can\u2019t say this enough\n-\tPrice \u2013 At $159, it\u2019s a good deal. For 24-hours at $109, it\u2019s a fantastic deal\n-\tSimple and efficient \u2013 works great out of the box, and surprises\n-\tPrice versus Power Ratio \u2013 What else in this class of phone is going to give you a quad-core processor, 3gb of RAM, and 32gb of storage space?\n-\tSurprisingly good camera, and interface! Cons:\n-\tTouch screen issues \u2013 not a problem for normal use, but can impact applications and advanced interaction\n-\tA little sluggish with some apps and games\n-\tNot full-HD \u2013 720p is adequate though, and on-par for price\n-\tCannot uninstall some pre-loaded apps\n-\tThe included screen protector is a nice gesture, but is a bit underwhelming and is a magnet for fingerprints. However, it does the job until you can get a higher quality or glass screen protector installed.Conclusion:\nAll in all, I was very impressed with the phone, especially considering the price point. Even if you live at the edge of the technological power curve, the R1 PLUS has many positive selling points which even higher-tier phones cannot offer, like true multi-day use and massive screen-on time. Sure, not everything is not top-notch, but at the entry market for this phone and the amount of financial investment required, you won\u2019t find many more capable phones in this price range, especially not one as notable as BLU. So\u2026 if you\u2019re looking for a cost-effective and efficient phone that lasts an entire day and hammers all of the basics, then this is your phone. If you\u2019re trying to stay one-step ahead of the competition and always chasing the latest and greatest in technology, then this probably isn\u2019t where you\u2019re looking in the first place. Recommendation:\nI give it an A+ for economy users, and a strong recommendation for normal phone users, especially during the 24-hour sale! It also performs well as a traveling media device, or as an inexpensive alternative for a backup, or a phone for your kids. It\u2019s really a versatile device that meets a lot of needs, and looks sharp at the same time. It may be an inexpensive phone, but the build quality and presentation are quite impressive.\nThe R1 PLUS, is available on both Amazon.com and BestBuy.com in Gun Metal Grey, at $159.99 unlocked.

I am reprinting it here. To this day I remain highly impressed with Qmadix Liquid Glass and highly recommend it. It is still serving me and my device very well.\nI don\u2019t plan on dropping my phone. I don\u2019t plan on scratching it with keys, spilling a drink on it, sitting down on it when it rests angled between the seat and the back of a chair. I don\u2019t plan on breaking my phone or giving it ugly scars.\nNone of us do.\nBut we all know accidents happen and that quite often. If not to us, then to someone we know.\nWe also love our phones (most of us, anyway). We spend significant amounts to purchase them. We spend money after the fact for cases, screen protectors, accessories of every shape and purpose. We use our phones, dote on them, cherish them, obsess over them\u2026 Depend on them.\nMy motto has long been, \u201cPhones are like people: they should never leave the house naked, it\u2019s just asking for trouble.\u201d\nI may be rethinking that\u2026\nOne of the things most of us love about our phone is the look of it. Time and again I hear that design is a top priority when choosing a cell phone. Then we shove it in a case, put on a screen protector of some sort and completely change the look and feel of the device, right? It\u2019s a counter-intuitive step, but viewed as necessary to protect your investment. I know I\u2019ve done it over and over with each new device. Some phones get more than one case as we search for the best fit, feel and most importantly the best look.\nBut what if you could go \u201cnaked\u201d with your phone and still have it protected? Isn\u2019t that ideal? To show off the design of the phone I often favor clear cases anyway. But even slim cases add bulk and even crystal clear cases change the whole look of the phone\u2026\nI\u2019ve tried full body skins before and even the best of them alters the look of the phone slightly. They are also a bit fussy to apply, everything has to align just right and there are often gaps anyway. The feel is usually tacky as well, at least for the clear style body skins I\u2019ve tried. They might peel on the edges and corners, leaving your beautiful device looking worn and tired.It\u2019s 2017, Phones are Big and Beautiful\nQuite recently I got my hands on an Alcatel Idol 4S Windows. It\u2019s a beautiful phone, camera wart and all. Sensually curved edges to the glass front and back, shapely metal frame with a tastefully understated gold tone to it. Idol 4S is a thin and elegant design and I\u2019m very happy with the look of the phone.\nThe 4S came to me gently used and in immaculate condition. The seller also included a clear Incipio case and I quickly added a Tempered Glass screen protector as is my habit. The device is not small despite how thin it is. It\u2019s a robust 5.5\u201d screen with fairly large top and bottom bezels. Add a case and you know the thing is in your pocket. The Incipio adds a lot of bulk. The TG protector covers well, but also interrupts the sensual flow of the native glass\u2026Enter Qmadix Invisible First Defense Liquid Glass\nWhat if there was a way to add 9H hardness to your phone without any bulk? What if it was stronger than naked, but just as bare looking?\nThis is exactly the claim Qmadix makes for their IFD Liquid Glass product: a scratch resistant 9H hardness nano-tech coating that is anti-bacterial, undetectable, bubble free and easy to apply. It fits any device up to a 10\u201d screen and offers a $100 screen replacement guarantee if you register your device within 30 days on the Qmadix website. Cue their video\u2026  \nI decided to take the plunge and go all in. I removed my Incipio case, peeled off the Tempered Glass screen protector and immediately suffered a bout of anxiety. I used the included cleaning wipe to prep my Idol 4S. This part actually relaxed me as I caressed the phone and felt those stylishly curved glass edges. My eyes took in every detail of the phone, the glass, the gold frame, the dual speaker ports front and rear, the 21MP camera hump. It reminded me just why I\u2019m trying this. A gorgeous machine that I want to show off\u2026 After the cleansing wipe, I dried the Idol 4S with the included microfiber cloth.\nI then opened the Liquid Glass applicator pouch. There was a wipe inside that was satisfyingly saturated with solution. I wiped down the Alcatel all over. I could see the Liquid Glass coating the phone as I worked, making sure to coat the curved edges, the front and back, the frame, the camera lens and the sub frame around it. This stage was reassuring as I could definitely tell there was a lot of the product to go around and I could see for myself how it was depositing on the device.\nWait 5 minutes and buff all over with the microfiber cloth. Wait 5 more minutes to start using the device. They state you should allow 48 hours for the Liquid Glass to cure and harden fully and that the application lasts for up to one year\u2026Immediate Impressions\nRight away I\u2019m impressed. My phone looks fantastic. The Liquid Glass is not quite invisible; you can\u2019t actually \u201csee\u201d it though there is a visible effect. The phone looks lustrous. There is a definite sheen added that allows the device to catch and reflect the light better. It looks somehow cleaner, more highlighted, almost like an advertising glamour shot.\nThe feel is fantastic. It is slick, but not slippery. When you move your finger across the screen there is a very pleasing glide and WordFlow on the keyboard is wonderful. No sticking, no stuttering, just pure motion as you intend. But the grip on the phone is still great. It doesn\u2019t slide right out of your hand as easily as it might if it were truly \u201cnaked.\u201d And fingerprints? What fingerprints? They just don\u2019t seem to happen.\nIt\u2019s such a pleasure holding the phone, interacting with the screen, pocketing the device, staring at it\u2026 It\u2019s like a weird dream carrying such an expensive phone without a case or screen protector. Nobody pinch me, I don\u2019t want to wake up.48 Hours In\nIt\u2019s very liberating carrying my phone around naked. I\u2019m feeling oddly confident and not nervous like I expected to. I can tell from the feel, the sheen and the lack of fingerprints that the Liquid Glass is there. Subtle clues, but they lend reassurance. Maybe I\u2019m a bit too confident? I place my phone in a precarious position just slightly more than two days after applying the Liquid Glass. The phone slides off the lip of the tub and I hear it clatter as it falls into the dry tub. Rather than trepidation though, I feel only curious. Not a scratch, no blemish. I smile and slide the phone into my pocket.Fast Forward\nIt\u2019s been five days. As confident as I\u2019ve felt, I\u2019ve also been delaying. But for you, readers, I squashed that nagging voice of reason and went ahead and did it.  \nWill I smash it with a hammer next? Douse it with water? Nope. You can. I\u2019ll let you. I\u2019m convinced that this Liquid Glass stuff works and works well. I have no issues treating my device as I normally would when it was in a case and had a screen protector on. I love my phone and that\u2019s the main point. I can show it off, I can use it like a normal human being while doing so. I can revel in how it feels in my hand and how easily it slips into a pocket. I have no need or desire to pummel the phone to test the absolute limits of the IFD Liquid Glass.\nThey say it lasts a year, only time will tell. I didn\u2019t want to wait that long to write this review, however. I\u2019m convinced and when I feel that it is wearing off, I\u2019ll likely get another application and reapply. After all, I love my phone. I want to protect it, but I also want to show it off. Now I can do both.Who is this for?At $39.99 it isn\u2019t inexpensive. This is for people who spend a lot on cases and screen protectors anyway. Those who invest further in their device after the initial purchase should consider this product.Those people who are enamored with the look of their phone benefit greatly.There is a generous amount of solution provided so large screen tablets and phones with front and back glass are ideal candidates.I think people who use ordinary caution with their devices every day should seriously consider Qmadix Invisible First Defense Liquid Glass.Larger phones really benefit the most because they also suffer the most from adding bulk with a case.Who should stay away?People that seem to have accidents happen to their devices all the time should probably stick to more traditional methods of protectionPeople on a budget that can\u2019t justify buying a new and expensive \u201ccase\u201d for their phone every 8 \u2013 12 months.People who work in dirty and hazardous environments where they constanty expose their device to risk.\nMe? I\u2019m hooked. It\u2019s an incredible feeling to walk out of the house with a \u201cnaked\u201d phone and not worry about doing so. I feel a bit naughty, a bit risqu\u00e9. And I like it.

Six months later, the Yoga Book is an absolutely awesome piece of hardware from corner to corner.... that\u2019s figuratively rough around the edges. \nOpening up the box, the tablet comes with a plethora of accessories. There\u2019s a notebook you can write on for the tablet, a stylus, as well as the tablet. \nI went on to truly admire the amazing build of the Yoga Book. The overall size and weight of the tablet made it feel like a low-profile notebook rather than a tablet. The black front and back make it inconspicuous yet the metal hinge on the side gives the tablet a feeling of stature. On the sides, there\u2019s a micro HDMI port, a Micro USB port, and a headphone Jack. \nOf course, the build doesn\u2019t end there, that premium hinge is one of the best parts of this tablet. It allows you to use the tablet in the four laptop/tablet hybrids we\u2019re all so accustomed to by now. Laptop, tablet, tent and stand mode all work well and the overall versatile build is something that I\u2019ve just become accustomed to that makes looking at the 1920X1200 display great.\nWhile opening up that display, you notice two things: it\u2019s beautiful and those bezels are way too big. Colors on the display look amazing, brightness got as low as I wanted (it\u2019s a small thing but I feel it\u2019s often overlooked), and my hours of binge watching Kevin Riazi videos were very enjoyable on this bad boy. However, the bezels are straight out of 2010. To be fair, I don\u2019t notice them when I\u2019m caught up in the glimmer in Kevin Riazi\u2019s eyes but otherwise, they were simply too big for such an otherwise well-made tablet. Consuming media with the speaks on the side was alright but they were a bit too ease to cover with my fingers.\nDuring all those hours of binge watching videos, my battery held up very well. I get about a day and a half of battery life on the Yoga Book with typical usage. When I use my Yoga Book on a more intensive day, my battery still lasts a day with no problem. \nThere are two sides to every coin and to every Yoga Book. The Halo Keyboard on the Yoga Book is by far the most eye-catching thing about this device. I can\u2019t tell you how many times opening up this laptop felt like opening up the Lost Ark. The Halo Keyboard\u2019s glow and overall futuristic design is just jaw dropping. Seriously. Of course, just like the Lost Ark, the Halo keyboard is riddled with issues... they\u2019re not Nazi face melting problems but problems nonetheless. \nAs cool as the halo keyboard is, simply put, typing on this isn\u2019t half as fast as I would have liked, it\u2019s uncomfortable and often unresponsive. Typing with more than two fingers has proven to be really difficult with this keyboard because my fingers will land on keys and randomly hit the up and down arrows or the function key... keys that I barely use anyways. Overall, while it\u2019s nice having the Halo Keyboard, typing on it isn\u2019t up to par. However, Lenovo\u2019s software adapts to how to type and makes my experience typing much better than day one with the Yoga Book.\nThe touchpad on the Yoga Book is also great for drawing with the included stylus. I\u2019m by no means an artist but I can pretty confidently say that this is the best drawing experience with a tablet I\u2019ve ever had. \nOther than the Halo Keyboard, the only other gripe I have with the Yoga Book\u2019s hardware are the two cameras. Each performs decently in lowlight and work fine for video calling but they\u2019re honestly nothing special.\nWith hardware out of the way, let\u2019s run down the software. Lenovo has their own custom version of Android 6.0.1 on the Yoga Book to make it feel more like a laptop. It\u2019s one of the best adaptations of Android for tablets I\u2019ve seen. For the most part, the skin is fairly straight forward but the multitasking bar at the bottom of the display at all times and the multi window support on this tablet make using the Lenovo book feel like an optimized experience, rather than a haphazard attempt to make a bloated phone like we\u2019ve seen from other tablets in the past. Performance has also been very good with the Yoga Book. Other than the keyboard stuttering I occasionally get when I type on very specific keys and some lag when I\u2019m working with too many apps in the background, the tablet is smooth as butter. The Yoga Book has been able to handle all my school work with ease and even graphically intensive games such as Bullet Force run well. There\u2019s not too much Lenovo has really done for the tablet otherwise. Yes, there are some nice built-in apps for getting work done but overall, you\u2019re getting a pretty vanilla Android experience. Lenovo says there is going to be a 7.0 update later this year.\nSo... is the steep price tag on this bad boy worth your cash? Maybe. As much as I love the Yoga Book book, it\u2019s still an Android tablet, meaning it\u2019s still got the faults of an Android tablet. While the experience of the Yoga Book itself is very good, for the amount you can buy this for, you\u2019re better off getting a Chromebook convertible with a more reliable keyboard for a fraction of the price. While I have not used it, perhaps the Windows 10 version is more competitive, check out the review on Windows Central here. However, if you\u2019re an artist or a student who wants to take notes with your hands but still wants some tech for the classroom, the Yoga Book is amazing. At the end of the day, you should think less about the actual tablet and more about the stylus that comes in the box. If you plan to use that stylus as much as you can, the Lenovo Yoga Book is practically unrivaled.\nEric Anthonyhttp://YouTube.com/Blaberheadhttp://Twitter.com/Blaberhead", "time": "04-25-2017 04:26 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5786317", "text": "Welcome to Android Central, and thanks for the review!

So what\u2019s the point of a budget smartphone? Simple, for people such as myself it\u2019s a cheaper way to pay full price for a secondary phone; and for others, it\u2019s a cheap way to replace their current phone. In this age of nearly $1,000 smartphones, it\u2019s nice to see people still making much cheaper like the Moto G5 Plus, starting at $230. I hadn\u2019t had a secondary phone in some time and I needed an Android phone for another purpose so the Moto G5 Plus was exactly what I was looking for. I went with the base model, which is 32GB storage with 2GB of RAM and is the $230 model. This review will cover that base model, so bear in mind that the 4GB of RAM upper models will handle things a little differently.Hardware\nThe Moto G5 Plus is the newest entry to the Moto G line of phones and is made by Lenovo. While the older models stuck to rubberized plastic for the body, Lenovo decided to go with a more flagship look to the G5 Plus. The front of the phone is all glass and there are iPhone sized bezels with a front facing speaker, the Moto logo, a front-facing camera, and a physical home button with a fingerprint sensor. The bottom of the phone holds the microUSB charging port, microphone, and a 3.5mm jack, while the left side of the phone has nothing. The top of the phone only has the SIM card/microSD card slot, and the right side has the volume rocker and power button. The back and sides of the phone are aluminum, the back houses the rather large rear facing camera with flash, another microphone, another Motorola logo, and the requisite FCC information. There is also a chrome border around the front of the phone.\nOne of the first things you\u2019ll notice is that the Moto G5 Plus is incredibly light, far lighter than you would expect. It is barely heavier than previous models while having the new aluminum body. I would say the lightness of the phone is the only thing that makes it feel like a cheaper phone, and it doesn\u2019t really feel like a cheaper phone. The fingerprint sensor is a nice touch on a mid-range phone too. It is fast and pretty accurate. You can rest your finger on it to unlock and even lock your phone. Even though the Moto G5 Plus is a cheaper phone, I would still recommend getting a case for some added grip as the ergonomic curve of the back of the phone with the aluminum makes it a little slippery. One of the nicer features that come with the G5 Plus is the Fast Charge charger, which they claim will give you six hours of battery life in fifteen minutes of charging. I noticed it will charge up sixty percent really quickly, I just didn\u2019t time it to see how long it actually took.\nAs far as audio is concerned, the only minor annoyance I have is with volume. Maybe this wouldn't bother me as much if I wasn't used to the old dual speakers of HTC and Apple's own new dual speakers. I may be biased to having more sound coming my way. Is it an issue though? No, not at all. Using the external speaker for video and speaker phone will work great. I even connected my BeatsX to see how the audio is with connected headphones. Here also my only concern for me personally is volume, I'm not a safe music listener. I really enjoy loud music. The Moto G5 will push out some volume, just not to the level I sometimes enjoy. You will not notice any major sound depreciation even when using Bluetooth headphones. The sound will still come across as clear as can be. Call quality is also fantastic, even when on wifi. I had no issues hearing other people and no one had any issues hearing me. I was actually surprised how well the wifi audio was on this phone.\nMotorola does give you a decent rear facing camera at 12MP and features what they call rapid focusing. I had some issues with stabilization while zoomed in because there is no optical image stabilization. The front facing isn\u2019t anything spectacular either, it is a 5MP sensor, though it does have flash. These cameras aren\u2019t going to give you the best low light performance, they will get the job done though. If you need to quickly access the camera you can twist your phone quickly twice to open the camera and do it again to change between front and rear cameras. If you only need a flashlight quickly, just chop your phone twice. These are some of the nicer quick access gestures Motorola offers on the G5 Plus. Camera SamplesLow LightNatural Light (Auto HDR)Video  Software\nOne of the things that Motorola is known for is one of the things I love the most about the software/user interface. The Moto G line is as close to stock Android as you can get without buying a Google Pixel, and I really do love it. One of the things I was disappointed in is that the G5 Plus does not have native photo storage, instead, all your photos are immediately uploaded to Google Drive. Some people may be okay with that, I myself find it a little annoying. One thing I do like is that the G5 Plus has Moto Gestures. With Moto Gestures you can remove the virtual keys at the bottom of the screen and your home button can take over those functions. Swipe right to pull up the app switcher/screen sharing setup, swipe left to go back, a light tap to go home, and other app dependent long and short tap functions. It took me a few minutes to realize that swiping left to go back functioned in all the apps and now I really enjoy it. For those who need the latest version of Android, you will get that. The Moto G5 Plus ships with Android 7.0 Nougat, however, it only has January\u2019s security patch as the most current.\nTo the left of the home screen you are greeted with Google Now, which can also use \u201cOK, Google.\u201d or connected devices to unlock your device with, or keep it unlocked. Your app drawer is a swipe up gesture from the home screen, and a swipe down from the home screen brings you to your quick settings and profile. If you\u2019ve used an Android phone recently, these things will be nothing new and intuitive to use. My biggest issue with the software is the seeming lack of settings. I\u2019ve used Android phones in the past as my daily drivers and I feel like the Moto G5 Plus lacks some of the settings that most flagship Android phones have. You will get all the settings you need, it just doesn\u2019t have some of the customization I've grown to enjoy.\nI don't play a huge amount of games on mobile and if you do, you will not have any issues at all. I played Super Mario Run and Asphalt 8 for a while and had no issues at all playing either game on the Moto G5 Plus. If you were worried at all about the overall performance of this particular budget phone, set those aside now. You won't notice any frame rate dropping, or any sort of lag while playing games. Coupled with the smoothness of the operating system and the G5 Plus is a solid phone with a smaller price tag. Aside from the obvious battery drain from game performance and screen on time, it does drain quicky, gaming is actually really enjoyable.\nAside from that, the Moto G5 Plus is just like any other Android device. You won't notice any lag at all, the only lag I run into is because of slow wifi. All scrolling and changing screens within apps is as smooth as anyone would expect from a smartphone. So if you're worried that you'll lose any speed or performance on this mid-range device, you needn't worry. It\u2019s a pretty straightforward device so it is easy to get started using. Just set up your screens how you like, adjust a few settings if you like, and you\u2019re up and running. If you\u2019re like me, you need to spend hours and hours downloading apps and logging into them all. It\u2019s the most annoying thing for me setting up a new phone, as necessary as it is.The GoodFast ChargeHas Android 7.0UnlockedThe BadNeeds a little added gripCameras aren\u2019t the bestNo native photo storageConclusion\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the weight and the mediocre camera experience, it would be hard to tell that the Moto G5 Plus is a mid-range phone. It\u2019s really that good. So if you\u2019re looking for a cheaper alternative or just want a nice backup phone, I would highly recommend the Moto G5 Plus. It is definitely one of my favorite Android phones on the market.

You can even take a test from Google to build the right homescreen with recommended links to icon packs, wallpapers and custom launchers.\nNot only apps, but phone manufacturers also pack some great customization options in their modified version of android. Before diving into what apps and icon packs to download, it is worthwhile to dive into your phone\u2019s customization settings to make it your own. While those settings may not provide you with great wallpapers and icon packs, they can give you just the things you need to customize the hardware and software options.\nIn this post, lets take a look at some of the best personalization options available in the Honor 8 smartphone. Honor 8 offers great performance and personalization options in a small yet powerful package. It runs Android 7.0 packed with Huawei\u2019s own Kirin 950 processor, 4GB RAM and dual lens 12 MP rear camera. Honor\u2019s android version is called Emotion UI (EMUI) and has tons of options to customize your device.Note: Huawei and Honor share EMUI and you may notice EMUI options and apps sometimes prefixed with either Huawei or Honor.

You can even take a test from Google to build the right homescreen with recommended links to icon packs, wallpapers and custom launchers.\nNot only apps, but phone manufacturers also pack some great customization options in their modified version of android. Before diving into what apps and icon packs to download, it is worthwhile to dive into your phone\u2019s customization settings to make it your own. While those settings may not provide you with great wallpapers and icon packs, they can give you just the things you need to customize the hardware and software options.\nIn this post, lets take a look at some of the best personalization options available in the Honor 8 smartphone. Honor 8 offers great performance and personalization options in a small yet powerful package. It runs Android 7.0 packed with Huawei\u2019s own Kirin 950 processor, 4GB RAM and dual lens 12 MP rear camera. Honor\u2019s android version is called Emotion UI (EMUI) and has tons of options to customize your device.Note: Huawei and Honor share EMUI and you may notice EMUI options and apps sometimes prefixed with either Huawei or Honor. While there shouldn't be any problems, such apps should work in Honor and Huawei phones but it is always good to check the reviews before you install it.Fingerprint scanner\nFingerprint scanner is probably the most accessed item in your phone. We use it for several things\u200a\u2014\u200aunlock phones and authenticate for purchases. Honor goes one step further by providing custom button options on the fingerprint scanner. Honor calls it Smart key. Your fingerprint scanner now acts as a button and you can set actions for single press, double press and long press.\nI quite enjoy this setup and find it very handy to open my favorite app or launch the camera quickly. You can also setup to show notification panel when you slide down on the scanner.\nYou can access the smart key options in: Settings->Smart assistance->Smart key\nDon\u2019t forget to also look into the fingerprint options to find out more options: Settings->Fingerprint IDKnuckle gestures\nGestures are one of the smart ways to ease clutter in your home screen. Many launchers provide the ability to tie specific actions like opening an app or launching camera to specific gestures.\nHonor provides knuckle gestures which as it name goes, you use your knuckle to do the desired action. \nFor example:\n- I can tap twice using my knuckle to take a screenshot\n- I can use two knuckles to quickly start screen recording\n- I can draw (specific, but limited) letters to open specific apps\nI use these gestures everyday and enjoy every moment of it! Here is an example of me using the knuckle gesture to open calculator app by drawing the letter C.\nYou can access the knuckle gestures options in: Settings->Smart assistance->Motion control->Knuckle gesturesMagazine unlock\nLets get it out, lockscreens are boring. You see the same wallpaper every day and there is nothing you can feel happy about it other than getting notifications from your loved ones.\nWell, with the magazine unlock option you can now configure and subscribe to dynamic wallpaper collections so that a new wallpaper is set for the lockscreen every time you turn on your phone.*\nThe wallpapers are beautiful coming from the Leica photography collection. You will start loving your lockscreen as you see a beautiful image when you turn on your phone.\nBelow are some screenshots of my honor 8 lockscreen:\nYou can access the magazine unlock options in: Settings->Screen lock and passwords->Lock screen->Magazine unlock\nMake sure you have set your screen lock style as Magazine unlock.Themes\nWhile there is no official app to download and set themes for Honor 8, there are plenty of themes and apps available in the Play Store to theme your Honor 8. One such app is Huawei Theme Manager which allows you to download themes for your Honor 8. Final thoughts\nIts quite amazing how these simple options make using your phone easier. They make your mundane daily tasks easily accessible. \nThanks to Android, phone manufacturers are able to provide such options for their users.", "time": "04-04-2017 08:38 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Review: Tech21 Evo Check Case for Pixel XL", "thread": [{"postID": "post5653716", "text": "The Tech21 Evo Check Case Review! \nThe Evo Check Case from Tech21 could very well be the best case I\u2019ve encountered for the Google Pixel XL. \nThe Evo Check is ultra thin and lightweight, but somehow manages to offer amazing protection while allowing full access to all the ports and buttons. The case offers Advanced Impact Protection from 2 metres or 6.6 feet with FlexShock and comes with a lifetime case warranty. \nThe Evo Check comes in two colours, you have black and white (Smokey and clear) I much prefer the look of the clear white case on the black Pixel. A lot of work has went into this case, all the ports are perfectly cut out, the buttons are easy to press, the lip at the front protects the screen when face down. The case even has chamfered edges to mimic the design of the Pixel. \nThis is a rubber case, so you won\u2019t need to worry about grip. I had no problem taking this phone in and out of pockets and it doesn\u2019t attract any pocket lint or dust for that matter. \nThe back has a kind of honeycomb design going on, which looks awesome with the white on black Pixel. \nOne thing I found really cool about this case are the cut outs for the USB port and speaker grills \u2013 they don\u2019t jag the fingers! With the thick cut outs, the phone sits excellently in my hand, with my pinky finger resting in the middle. I\u2019ve tested way too many cases that are uncomfortable to hold due to the port cut outs. \nThe Evo Check case fits tight! It\u2019s a struggle to get the case on and off, but I don\u2019t want a case that offers loose protection, I want something to wrap around my phone to give me the confidence that if / when I drop it, it\u2019s going to remain protected. \nA lot of attention to detail has went into this case, which is something I\u2019ve came to expect from Tech21, which is why going to any other case seems like a step down in my opinion.

[{"title": "AXGIO Backfit Bluetooth Earphones", "thread": [{"postID": "post5599284", "text": "The fine folks at AXGIO provided me these Bluetooth earphones for review. These were somewhat unique for me because they were semi flexible in addition to being rectangular There is also an offset on the ear piece. I tested these headphones for a week with various devices, Android and iOS, and it worked well on all devices. Build, Packing, and Fitment \nThe earphones came in a small box, and inside it was a soft shell case with a zipper to carry the Bluetooth earphones and accessories. In addition to the pouch, it also came with a microUSB charging cable, (3) ear cushions, and a cable management clip. The medium sized ones were pre-installed, but you can use a smaller or larger one, or mix them if you would prefer. I found that medium worked on the right ear, and small worked on the left ear. It is important to spend a few minutes to set these up to your liking and to get a good fitment. Otherwise, sound quality could be poor with a poor fitment. I found that it is easiest to put the earpiece in the ear first, then slide the cable into place. \nPersonally, I don\u2019t like the offset configuration that much , but I let my friend use it and he really liked them, so it would be a matter of personal preference.\nPhysically, the earphones seem well constructed. Even though they are made of plastic, they don\u2019t feel cheap. They felt pretty light compared to other Bluetooth earphones that I have used. The volume and power controls are built onto the housing of the right earpiece. The other side of the right earpiece has the charging port which allows you to charge via the provided microUSB cable.Connection/Prompts/Controls\nPairing these is pretty easy. From the Powered Off state, press and hold the Power button until you hear it say Pairing. Then open the Bluetooth settings on your device and select the earphones. It may take a few seconds for your device to find the earphones. \nThe prompts for Power On, Power Off, Connected, Pairing, etc. are in English, which is nice because I have used Bluetooth earphones which have a series of beeps. For some reason, there is a slight \u201ccrackling\u201d sound when at these prompts, but luckily there is no \u201ccrackling\u201d when listening to music or watching a movie. There is no prompt when you press Play to start or stop music, but I don\u2019t think you need one anyway. There is also no prompt when you press the Volume Up or Volume Down button. There is an audible beep when you hit maximum or minimum volume. Long pressing the Volume Up/Down buttons will allow you to go Next and Previous tracks, respectively, and there is no prompt here either.Calls and Music\nI have tested it for calls, and it works good. When getting a call, you will hear the ringtone through the Bluetooth earphones, and you press the center button to answer the call. Press the center button again to end the call. If you have music playing and receive a call, then the music will pause, and you will hear the ringtone. The music will continue again once you end the call. You can also double press the center button to call the last person you called.\nThe range of volume is very good, from very very low to VERY loud. When I say loud, I mean REALLY loud. Setting the earphones on my desk, I could use it as a Bluetooth speaker, granted not a very loud one, but you get the idea. I couldn\u2019t listen to the volume on maximum because it hurt my ears. But to the sound didn\u2019t distort even on the maximum level that wouldn\u2019t hurt my ears. Sound Quality\nI am not an audiophile by any means, but I will say that music sounded good on these earphones. I also have a set of Jaybird X2, which I think sound a little better, but also cost 3-4x as much. It has a good amount of bass, but it isn\u2019t bass heavy like Beats. I would say for most people, the sound quality would be more than adequate.Exercising\nOne of the main reasons why I bought these are because of the water resistance (IPX4). I sweat quite a bit when exercising, and so far, these earphones still work great. They are noise isolating, so please be careful if you use them jogging in the streets. Even when running, there is very minimal cord noise. The cord itself forms an ear hook which helps to hold the Bluetooth earphones in place when exercising. Conclusion\nIf you are looking for a pair of sport earphones for a reasonable price then look no further. These provide great quality for the budget oriented sport Bluetooth earphone shopper.\nNormally, these go for $29.99, but for a limited time, AXGIO is selling them for $18.99 with coupon code \u201cJHVGAMXV\u201d:https://www.amazon.com/AXGIO-Backfit...cUvbUpU5599284", "time": "12-08-2016 04:31 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Axgio Mini Pro Bluetooth Headset", "thread": [{"postID": "post5522651", "text": "A mini, in-ear Bluetooth headset, with a mini price.About this review:\nAxgio sent over their Mini Pro bluetooth headset for me to review.

Calls were made to other Verizon lines with and without Advanced Calling 1.0, other mobile lines with T-Mobile, and landlines.In the box:\nAxgio Mini Pro headset, micro USB cable for charging, micro USB cable earphone(for stereo), 4 ear clips, 10 sizes of ear tips, and a carrying case.Fit:\nThe Axgio is intended to fit in your ear. Everyone\u2019s ears are different but for me, I had no issues using it in that way - switching to one of the smaller ear tips. If it didn\u2019t work, Axgio provides various ear clips to help. The plastic clips attach snug to the Mini Pro. Be careful though as I managed to snap one while trying to get it onto the headset.\nWhile not particularly a sport-focused headset, I did try jogging with the Mini Pro in my ear. At no point did it fall out, though it did feel like it could. If you use this while exercising, you may want to use one of the provided ear clips but your mileage may vary.\nWearing the Mini Pro for multiple hours was fine and not cumbersome. Pairing:\nStandard pairing here. Long press the Mini Pro\u2019s multifunction button to get it into pairing mode and find it with your phone. As clunky as Bluetooth pairing can be, I had no issues here.Audio Quality:\nFor such a tiny headset, I was impressed with the audio. I listened to a few EDM songs from Google Play Music as well as some podcast shows on YouTube. Audio was crisp with no distortion. Lows exceeded expectations and highs were clear.\nWant stereo sound? Plug in the provided micro USB earphone. Sound quality when used together was equal. I really like having this option.Call Quality:\nI made various test calls while paired with a Motorola Moto Z Force Droid on the Verizon network. I called other Verizon handsets, as well as a T-Mobile line and a landline. Call quality was consistent - callers came in loud and clear with no distortion and callers could hear me loud and clear. Battery Life and Charging:\nI streamed audio for about 4 hours straight before the Mini Pro died on me. For the size, I find that to be quite adequate. It took less than an hour to get a full charge.Recap:\nAxgio built a quality mini headset for a great price. I\u2019m actually shocked that this is currently under $20.\nPros:Battery life good for the size.Includes tons of options for fitment.Surprisingly good audio quality.\nCons:A bit bulky for a mini.\nBuy at Amazon ($16.99 at the time of this review): http://amzn.to/2bUauwr", "time": "10-25-2016 12:30 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5522968", "text": "Well done!", "time": "10-25-2016 02:09 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5555456", "text": "Thank you!", "time": "11-09-2016 10:08 PM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"title": "AXGIO PowerEdge 21W 2-Port USB Solar Charger Review", "thread": [{"postID": "post5551671", "text": "The fine folks at AXGIO provided me this solar charger for review. I tested it while charging two smartphones, and it was able to quickly charge them at the maximum capacity. Note that these are older smartphones which only do 5V/1A. AXGIO claims 5V/3A total, or 2.4A per port. Note that I am not sure how they came up with 21W, since USB port output is 5V, so at 3A, you are looking at 15W. Perhaps the panels are rated at 21W, but the conversion/loss when bringing it to USB brings it down to 15W? I guess that\u2019s just how it\u2019s rated as the competition does similar. But regardless, it works well for its purpose. Build and Features \nThe charger has a three panel design which folds up into three for ease of storage, and is held together by magnets. The solar panels are on the inside when folded up. I have put my 16,000 mah battery pack and Honor 8 on the charger for you to get an approximate feel of the size. \nIt is made of high-wear polyester canvas which feels like a very sturdy material. It has metal reinforced holes on all four corners, so you can hang it from your backpack, allowing you to charge while on a hike! There is a mesh pocket with a zipper which you can store your cables when not in use. There is an elastic strap which can be used to help with cable management, or you can also strap in a small smartphone or power bank. The strap just barely fit my Honor 8, and didn\u2019t fit my iPhone 7 Plus. However, you can still put the iPhone 7 Plus in the pouch and just barely zipper it back up. There is also a wire grommet which can be used to route the cable out of the pocket, in case you are doing a larger device or two devices. AXGIO lists the weight as 21oz, and although I didn\u2019t weigh it, the weight seems about right. There are lighter versions from other manufacturers but I like this one more because the heft makes it less likely to get blown over from the wind.Charging\nI should warn everyone\u2026I tried to put the charger and two phones in direct sunlight. Big mistake! The battery temperature on my phone got to 137\u00b0F! The other phone got to like 125\u00b0F. When this happens, the phone automatically slows and at some point stops charging the phone due to overheat condition. When charging, make sure that the device isn\u2019t in direct sunlight! \nSecondly, I tried charging behind a screen door and it charged very slowly. So, if you want to use this, the panels need to be in direct sunlight! AXGIO does provide a kickstand to prop the charger in the direction of the sun. Another alternative, if you are hiking, would be to strap the power bank to the solar charger, and hang the charger from your back pack to let it charge during the day, and at night you can use the power bank to charge the phone.

This car charger works well and is also aesthetically pleasing. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality car chargerPackaging/BuildThe charger was packaged in a small brown cardboard box. The charger was on one side of the box, while the microUSB cables were on the other side. The charger is average size compared to other dual quick chargers out there, and the cable feels sturdy. The charger has a matte black finish, which feels pleasant and also shouldn\u2019t show scratches as much as the glossy finish some other companies use. As a bonus, it also includes (2) microUSB cables, which worked perfectly on my Moto G4 Plus. Please do note though that many new Androids are using USB C, so you may need to use your stock cable if this applies to you. UsageI was originally going to test this with my Samsung Galaxy Note 7, however, the recall came around, and so I turned in that phone, and therefore was not able to test it's quick charge capabilities simultaneously on both ports. However, I was able to test this charger with my Lenovo Moto G4 Plus and iPhone 7 Plus, and the charger worked well. When used with the Lenovo Moto G4 Plus, it did indicate Turbo Charging, which is Lenovo\u2019s implementation of Qualcomm Quick Charge. Please see the chart below for the charging rate on the Moto G4 Plus. This is about what I see when using a variety of Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0/3.0 chargers. In reality, it really should support any phone that is compatible with Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0/3.0 such as the Note 7, S7, HTC 10, LG G5, and more. Although this is Quick Charge 3.0, it is also backwards compatible with Quick Charge 2.0. For my iPhone 7 Plus, it charged about as quick as other third party wall chargers that I have used from various brands. There is no charging chart because Apple doesn\u2019t support it.

It offers Google\u2019s voice search from the remote control / controller. Comes with expandable storage and lots of ports.

Some say the device is a bit on the large size, but for what it offers I\u2019m surprised it fits into such a compact device. The device is stealthy, with the only colour coming from the LED light once you power the device up. A bright green LED light bleeds out of the top, giving the impression you\u2019re getting a glimpse into the Shields powerful soul. If you prefer the total stealth look, the LED light can be turned off in the settings. This can be useful when watching TV or a movie and you don\u2019t want to be distracted by the light. I haven\u2019t turned it off and I haven\u2019t reduced its brightness as I think it looks too cool. \nOnce you have the device plugged in and all your cables in the relevant ports, it's time to find the power button! This might sound like a straightforward task, but it\u2019s not the easiest power button to find. On the bottom right hand corner, you\u2019ll find a small NVIDIA logo, which is also a capacitive power button. Capacitive buttons are a theme throughout the NVIDIA shield experience, the controller and remote contain similar stealth like buttons (more on that soon)\nOne thing that makes the NVIDIA shield stand out from the competition is its array of ports. I found myself using the dual USB 3.0 ports to charge my phone and controller accessory. There is also a Micro USB port / slot for when you want to add more storage or transfer files to the box. At the front you\u2019ll find the IR receiver, which also works well with universal remote controls. Within the NVIDIA shield you\u2019ll even find a setup wizard for adding such accessories. \nWith the NVIDIA shield box, you will also receive the game controller. For a small fee there is also a remote control you can buy \u2013 I would highly recommend the remote control. Although you can do more with the game controller I found it a tad big and intrusive when simply trying to launch a movie or watch some TV. The remote control is sleek and light in the hand, it has a brushed metal finish and it just compliments the TV box so well. It has a voice search button, back button, home button and a round capacitive button. The remote control also has a unique capacitive volume rocker, simply slight up in the middle of the control to increase the volume and slight down to decrease. I really enjoyed using this control, but as I mentioned above, the game controller can do much more and it\u2019s free with the device (a big plus). The game controller has a home button, Back button, volume buttons (not capacitive), D-Pad, joystick and voice search button. Although both controls can navigate throughout the TV box without issues, I found the game controller easier to use when scrolling through apps, web pages etc. The game controller also is the preferred controller when playing games (obviously). I\u2019m not a big video game player, I own an Xbox 360 \u2013 swapping between both controllers was easy and effortless. The only issue I found with the game controller is the use of the capacitive buttons. On the remote control it is implemented well, it compliments the control well, but on the game controller I feel like physical buttons throughout would have been better. When playing a game and having to jump between physical buttons to capacitive buttons, it took my brain a while to learn and adjust to the different pressures required when pressing the buttons. One feature I loved was that both controllers come with a headphone jack, which is really cool when you want to keep things quiet (sleeping wife / baby and asphalt 8 come to mind) both controllers are connected wirelessly and can also be used with the supplied cables.   \nNavigating through the TV box is easy and simple to use. All your apps are arranged into groups like games / apps which makes it easy for you to locate what you\u2019re looking for. Suggested content from Google Play / Netflix / YouTube can be found at the top of the display in a card like fashion, which is fun to scroll through. Android TV is easy to understand, it didn\u2019t take long for me to feel like I had been using Android TV for months. You have all the necessary settings you would find on any Android phone or tablet. It also comes with Google cast built in, so you can easily cast movies / pictures / music from your phone / tablet to the TV Box. Voice search is a joy to use, it\u2019s accurate and I found myself using it a lot more often that I thought I would. My experience with navigating through the different screens, launching apps, voice search, settings menu came with zero lag (thanks to the processor on board). Android TV apps don\u2019t have the best of selection, but whenever I ran into a situation where the TV couldn\u2019t find an app, I would simply launch it on my phone and cast it to the TV. You can launch 4K video content on the NVIDIA shield, which is more evidence of future proofing with this device, however I don\u2019t have a 4K TV so I can\u2019t properly comment on this section. \nWhere this TV box stands out from the competition is its gaming facility. You can find games from the Play Store and from GeForce Now, which is a streaming option offered from NVIDIA. There are games for all occasions from the Play Store and they all play exceptionally well. From Pac Man to Asphalt 8 \u2013 I didn\u2019t find any issues launching games or playing them. In the play store there are a ton of games for free as well as paid games. GeForce Now is NVIDIA\u2019s game streaming service, which offers a decent amount of top tier games that you can pay for via monthly subscription fee of \u00a37 or a one off upfront fee. Depending on your internet connection, you can stream games in 720p or 1080p. Before you commit to buying the game, NVIDIA will run a test to determine if you can launch the game successfully. Similar to the Play Store, the games on GeForce Now worked flawlessly with no lag or display issues. Even games at 720p look great. The game list is small, but it\u2019s ever growing. For me, someone who doesn\u2019t play a lot of video games, the option to stream a game every now and then for \u00a37 a month is a good option to have. It\u2019s the gaming version of Netflix. If you\u2019re a serious gamer, this device isn\u2019t for you, but if you\u2019re like me and enjoy picking up a controller and playing something random every now and then, the NVIDIA shield won't fail you. Bottom line\nWhen it comes to competition, there isn\u2019t much competing with the NVIDIA shield; however this hasn\u2019t stopped NVIDIA from building a future proof, powerful Android TV box. With the Tegra X1 processor and 3GB of RAM, there isn\u2019t much this device can\u2019t cope with. If you\u2019re looking for a device that can become your complete entertainment package, while offering you a gaming experience at the same time, this device is a must. \nThe Tall Guy!", "time": "09-15-2016 09:24 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Seidio Surface and Dilex cases for the Galaxy S7", "thread": [{"postID": "post5420377", "text": "Seidio were kind enough to send us four cases to review, two Surface cases offering slim and sleek protection as well as two Dilex cases for more rugged / hardcore protection. Seidio have partnered up with Kryptek who provide combat proven features and designs in ultra-high performance technical and tactical outdoor adventure apparel. The Seidio Kryptek collection brings strong, durable cases with distinct camouflage patterns where no two cases are ever the same due to their detailed pattern and production process. \nSeidio Surface with a kickstand from the Kryptek collection: Features exclusively licensed Kryptek patterns for a truly unique look that pushes design to the limit Hydro transfer process provides seamless integration of the pattern with the case that won\u2019t chip or scratch off Amazingly thin design at just 2mm thick with a Polycarbonate exterior layer that features our signature soft touch coating TPU inner layer adds an extra layer of protection with Hexguard technology that helps dissipate shock in the event of impact Zinc-alloy, magnetic kickstand for media viewing that securely snaps back into place when not in use Compatible with wireless charging and NFC functions \nWhat struck me the most about the Surface cases was their ability to offer great protection, while remaining sleek and slim. When you put on a Surface case you instantly get the reassurance that the phone can take bumps / drops. Partnering up with Kryptek gives the cases an ultra cool camouflage appeal. Just be sure to remember where you put the phone down, as the camouflage design is very well executed. \nThe case comes in at 2mm thick, which is very impressive considering it still manages to offer TPU inner layering for protection as well as a Polycarbonate exterior layer. Round the back you\u2019ll find a zinc-alloy, magnetic kickstand to help with media viewing. The kickstand snaps back into place, giving you the confidence that it won\u2019t come loose. The Surface case also offers precise cut outs and button covers to increase the protection and accessibility. The Surface case comes in two parts, a bottom and a top, offering a slide-in design for quick and easy installation.  \nThere are no short cuts with the Surface case, the case fits perfectly around the phone, no gaps were found and all the buttons / ports were easily accessible. The case offers a lip at the front to protect the screen if you have the phone face down, it also protrudes enough at the back to cover the camera lens.  \nThe overall case has a soft matte finish to it, very similar to the Nexus 5; this allows the phone to feel good in the hand, while not being slippery. Check out the latest range from Seidio and their Surface Kryptek collection here: https://www.seidioonline.com/style/surface-kryptek/\nMoving on to the Big Brother in the pack, the Seidio Dilex case offers excellent protection to your phone, with it\u2019s rugged looks accompanied by the Kryptek finish, this case is onto a winner. \nSeidio Dilex with a kickstand from the KRYPTEK collection: Exclusively licensed Kryptek pattern for a unique look Hydro transfer process provides seamless integration of the pattern with the case Certified 6 ft. impact protection with unique corner cushion and dual layer design Signature Hexguard Technology on inner TPU layer adds more shock protection in the event of impact Zinc-alloy, magnetic kickstand for viewing media and snaps back into place when not in use Compatible with wireless charging and NFC functions \nThe Surface case offers protection to your phone, but the Dilex case offers extreme protection to your phone. It comes with a certified 6 ft drop protection. Being \u2018The Tall Guy\u2019 I know all too well the damage dropping a phone from 6ft can do, with the Dilex case I don\u2019t need to worry. \nWith its dual layer design and high impact enhanced corners with Hexguard technology, you know this phone has all round protection.  \nThe Dilex case comes with all the same attention to detail as the Surface case, such as precision cut outs and ports for accessibility, Polycarbonate outer layer and TPU inner layer, built in zinc alloy magnetic kickstand and a lip that protrudes over the front of the screen for protection as well as a protruding back to protect the camera lens. All this plus more padding and it's only 3.6mm thick is impressive. \nComparing both the Surface and Dilex cases side by side, I would say that they both look excellent. They both offer protection, but the Dilex stands out from its smaller, slightly thinner sibling. The Dilex case looks like the type of case that could take a beating and still look brand new. When it comes to protection, both the Surface and Dilex will have you covered, but for that added protection with the 6ft drop certificate I would recommend the Dilex case. Both cases add minimum weight to the phone, but the Dilex case seems slightly heavier, and thicker.  \nMatching these cases with a phone that is IP68 rated, there really isn\u2019t much you can\u2019t throw at them, well \u2013 maybe a tank! \nCheck out the latest range from Seidio and their Dilex Kryptek collection here: https://www.seidioonline.com/style/dilex-kryptek/\nThe Tall Guy!", "time": "09-15-2016 09:03 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Axgio Empower Fast Charge Qi Pad", "thread": [{"postID": "post5398506", "text": "Axgio Empower Fast Charge Qi Pad\nWireless charging has been with us for some time and those who use it regularly love it. Many find it advantageous to have a charging pad or stand at those places where they spend a lot of time. It\u2019s easy and convenient to just plunk your phone down and have it start charging. No wires to mess with and when you are ready to go, just grab your phone and you are off. Keep a charging pad at your desk, at your bedside, in your living room, your workspace. If you like keeping your device topped up and ready, the advantages of wireless charging become indispensable.\nQi wireless charging is a widely recognized standard and in the past couple of years Qi charging has become very common as a feature on mid and high range devices. The number of available Qi chargers has exploded and there are so many options it is sometimes hard to sort through them all. If you are like me, you\u2019ve tried a few and are always on the lookout for the next advantage.A More Modern Approach\nQi chargers are evolving. The new generation is looking for ways to stand out from the crowd and I believe the Axgio Empower is loaded with great features to help it rise above the challenges that Qi pads faced in the past. It\u2019s a forward thinking device that is ready to integrate into your charging routine.Size:\nThe first thing that struck me when I unboxed my Axgio was the very welcome and generous size of the pad. I\u2019ve used and moved on from pads previously for being too small and the Axgio fits the modern smartphone with a large 3.6\u201d (95mm) landing pad. This makes a stable base to hold your phablet and also makes it easier to hit the target every time. If you are an experienced Qi user you just know where that receiver is on your phone and trying to judge the landing when the pad is dwarfed beneath your device is often a frustrating experience. Not so with the Empower, I was able to accurately judge just where on the pad I was landing and had no worries about hitting the sweet spot every time. For the record I have a Lumia 1520 which is a big boy phone for sure. At 6.41\u201d x 3.36\u201d (162.8mm x 85.4mm) without a case, I\u2019ve finally found a Qi pad that feels proportional to my device.Design:\nThe Axgio is full of thoughtful design features. The entire body is soft touch. It just feels nice to handle and the material gives it a great matte finish. No overly shiny plastic so it should slide tastefully into almost any d\u00e9cor. The top of the Qi pad has a very grippy rubber ring that makes you feel secure about leaving your phone on the pad and the four large feet keep the Empower just where you placed it on your desk or nightstand. The microUSB port has a small shelf over the top to help the cord blend in.Soft Glow LED:\nI\u2019ll admit I was skeptical about the soft glow LED feature. Having used the Axgio Empower at my bedside for the past few nights I\u2019m now a believer. It really is a very well executed feature and the LED is not intrusive at all. I have another charger I was using on my nightstand and I had the LED covered with electrical tape because it was way too bright. The people at Axgio really have this dialed in perfectly. You can tell your charging status at a glance without having the light disrupt your sleep. The LED glows Red when the pad is waiting for a device, Blue when it is charging and Purple when your device is charged. If you ever put an incompatible device on the pad it blinks Red to alert you. Just for laughs I put a phone on the Qi charger that I know doesn\u2019t have any wireless charging capability and sure enough, I got the blinking Red LED.Adaptability:\nFast charging is rapidly coming on as a new standard, but maybe you are still on the older Quick Charge 2.0. Or perhaps you have devices that are split between charging speeds. No worries, the Empower has you covered either way. It supports both standards and is smart enough to detect what your device needs. Input can be 5 volt and up to 2 amps (which outputs 5v 1a) or 9 volt and up to 1.67 amps (which outputs 9v 1.1a). You need the faster 9 volt charger to get fast charging, but you won\u2019t have to swap chargers to swap which device you put on the pad. I paired the Axgio Empower with an adaptive 5v/9v charger and it worked beautifully with my 1520 which is on the Quick Charge 2.0 standard. My phone charged as it normally would and didn\u2019t get hot. The Empower has protection from overheat, over voltage, under voltage and short circuit. I also tried several 5v chargers and they all worked equally as well. In short, charging on the Axgio is exactly what you expect without any fuss or surprises. It even works with cases up to 5mm in thickness.\nThe Axgio Empower provides fast charging with compatible phones including the Samsung Galaxy Series S7, S7 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, Note 7 and Note 5 models.Wrap-up:\nHere\u2019s where I get picky. There is no charging block included. For a Qi pad of this type I\u2019d love to see Axgio include a 5v/9v adaptive charger. Yes many of us do have a lot of chargers and cords lying around, but let\u2019s take the guesswork and experimentation out of the equation and just supply the charger that fits best. I will say, however, that I found the Empower very willing to pair with any charging block and cable I threw in the mix and that absolutely is not the case with some other Qi pads I\u2019ve tested. And let\u2019s talk about the supplied cable. It is one meter long. If you are like me, you get easily frustrated with short cords. Especially for an application like this. Your Qi pad will not necessarily be that close to an outlet if it is at your workstation. Bedside is likely to have a handy outlet, but on a larger desk in a home office, in your home workshop or at your place of business you probably need something more generous in length. I\u2019d like to see a five foot or even a six foot cord. Buck the trend of giving short cables and no charging block. Make this the complete package from the moment you unbox it.\nOther than the charger/cable, which I could complain about with any comparable product, there was absolutely nothing I could fault the Axgio Empower for. Great look and feel, generous size and it just worked effortlessly. I love the soft glow LED. This is easily the best Qi pad I\u2019ve tried and I\u2019ve been through at least a half a dozen in the past two years. The Axgio Empower is definitely a keeper.Pros:\nGenerous size and easy targeting\nSoft Glow LED really works\nAdaptable to many chargers and cables without missing a beat\nDoesn\u2019t overheat my phone\nGood looks and great functionalityCons:\nA longer cable would be very useful\nYou have to supply your own charging block\nThe Axgio Empower Fast Wireless Qi Charging Pad is available through Amazon and is $23.99 USD.

I tested these headphones for a few days with my Samsung Galaxy Note 7. I was going to test them on my iPad and iPhone, however, I put them in my bag and forgot to pull up the vertical zipper \u2013 so it probably fell out somewhere. I looked everywhere and couldn\u2019t find them. Which is a disappointment, because I really liked these earphones. I didn\u2019t get a chance to take any pictures, but I will include a stock photo for reference.Build, Packing, and Fitment \nThe earphones came in a small box, and inside it was a soft shell case with a zipper to carry the Bluetooth earphones and accessories. In addition to the pouch, it also came with a microUSB charging cable, (3) ear wing sets, (3) ear tips, and a cable management clip. The medium sized ones were pre-installed, but you can use a smaller or larger one. I didn\u2019t find the ear wings very useful, so I removed it. There is also a cable management clip, which, while not the most elegant design out there, does the job. I tried to use the cable management clip from my Jaybird earphones, and they worked better, except that they permanently creased the cable. It is important to spend a few minutes to set these up to your liking and to get a good fitment. Otherwise, sound quality could be poor with a poor fitment. \nPhysically, the earphones seem well constructed of both plastic and aluminum. They have a little heft to them, due to the aluminum and magnetic component, but it wasn\u2019t overly heavy. The volume and power controls are built onto a rectangular housing on the wire, which also allows you to charge via the provided microUSB cable. Probably due to the magnetic component, they aren\u2019t the smallest Bluetooth earphones around, but they also aren\u2019t massive either.Connection/Prompts/Controls \nPairing these is pretty easy. From the Powered Off state, press and hold the Power button until you hear it say Pairing. Then open the Bluetooth settings on your device and select the earphones. It may take a few seconds for your device to find the earphones. \nThe prompts for Power On, Power Off, Connected, Pairing, etc. are in English, which is nice because I have used Bluetooth earphones which have a series of beeps. For some reason, there is a slight \u201ccrackling\u201d sound when at these prompts, but luckily there is no \u201ccrackling\u201d when listening to music. There is no prompt when you press Play to start or stop music, but I don\u2019t think you need one anyway. There is an audible beep when you press the Volume Up or Volume Down button. There is a longer audible beep when you hit maximum or minimum volume. Long pressing the Volume Up/Down buttons will allow you to go Next and Previous tracks, respectively.\nThe earphones power off after some time of inactivity to save batteries. To power on, simply long press the power button. It automatically reconnected to my phone.Calls and Music\nI have tested it for calls, and it works good. When getting a call, you will hear the ringtone through the Bluetooth earphones, and you press the center button to answer the call. Press the center button again to end the call. If you have music playing and receive a call, then the music will pause, and you will hear the ringtone. The music will continue again once you end the call.\nThe range of volume is very good, from very very low to VERY loud. When I say loud, I mean REALLY loud. Setting the earphones on my desk, I could use it as a Bluetooth speaker, granted not a very loud one, but you get the idea. I couldn\u2019t listen to the volume on maximum because it hurt my ears. But to the sound didn\u2019t distort even on the maximum level that wouldn\u2019t hurt my ears. Sound Quality\nI am not an audiophile by any means, but I will say that music sounded good on these earphones. I also have a set of Jaybird X2, which I think sound a little better, but also cost 3-4x as much. It has a good amount of bass, but it isn\u2019t bass heavy like Beats. I would say for most people, the sound quality would be more than adequate.Exercising\nOne of the main reasons why I bought these are because of the water resistance (IPX6). I sweat quite a bit when exercising, and so far, these earphones still work great. They are noise isolating, so please be careful if you use them jogging in the streets. Even when running, there is very minimal cord noise. If you want to take off the earphones when exercising, then you can hang them around your neck using the magnetic clip. This is a nice addition because sometimes, my wife will come and talk to me a bit when I am exercising. Conclusion\nIf you are looking for a pair of sport earphones in the $30 range, then look no further. These provide great quality for the budget oriented sport Bluetooth earphone shopper.\nIf you are interested, you can pick up these earphones at Amazon:https://www.amazon.com/AXGIO-Zest-Bl...cUvbUpU5413875", "time": "09-12-2016 04:23 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5415488", "text": "Thanks for the write up.

For this review I was given 3 cases to test out, all for the S7. Verge Series\nRugged, tough, premium build, secure; these are just a few words I\u2019d use to describe the Verge S7 case. The case feels really good in the hand, the ruggedness adds some confidence in the hands while holding the S7. It doesn\u2019t add much weight to the phone, with the case coming in at 1.2 oz. The case is sock resistant; it has certified military grade drop protection encase you decide to launch the phone to the ground, or it happens to slip out of you fingers. The case comes in two layers; you have the impact resistant layer, which is a matte, soft rubber material followed by the hard frame. \nI\u2019ve had many phone cases in my time, but the Verge Series case is up there at being a tough case for a fragile phone. Despite the case being strong and rugged, you get a very good premium finish to the case. It feels nice and sturdy in the hand, while managing to retain the S7\u2019s premium look and feel. \nThe Verge case protrudes by 1.5 mm around the phone, meaning the screen won\u2019t come into contact with any surface if you\u2019re lying it screen down. This is the case for you if you tend to drop your S7.  Samsung Galaxy S7 Case Verge Series | VRS DesignSingle Fit Series\nWhat I liked about the Single fit case is the material; I\u2019m a sucker for a matte finish. Sure, it won\u2019t offer you nearly as much protection as the Verge Series, but it just feels better in the hand. It reminds me of holding my beloved Nexus 5, but better. It\u2019s the lightest case that VRS sell, coming in at 1.0 oz \u2013 you\u2019ll hardly notice any weight at all while holding the phone in this case. \nRound the sides of the phone you have metallic buttons, which provide you with instant feedback when pressing them. Not once did I press a button and be let down by the response. \nOne thing that I instantly noticed is that the matte bodied case manages to remain fingerprint free. It\u2019s such a welcome release not having to wipe the phone down using a piece of clothing. I also liked the precise cut outs for the speaker and charger \u2013 there were no overlaps. \nI like this case, it\u2019s minimalistic, feels great in the hand, offers strong grip and will protect the phone if it falls. It also has a 1.5 mm protruding surface and back, which protects the screen and camera lens  Samsung Galaxy S7 Single Fit Series | VRS DesignDamda Clip Series\nSimilar to the Layered Dandy case, the Damda Clip case offers an alternative way for you to carry the contents of your wallet. It uses a clip found at the back of the case, that can hold up to 8 cards (I tested) as well as actual money (notes) the clip is strong and tight, giving the impression that your cards will be safe if you decide to store them round the back. \nIf I\u2019m being honest I didn\u2019t find myself using the clip feature for my cards all that much. What I did find it handy for though was being able to store cash notes. This is extremely useful if you are out shopping, having a night out in the pub / club or just out spending money! \nApart from the clip offering, this is a really good, strong / sturdy case. It looks like it can take a battering. Weighing in at 1.7 oz it feels heavy to hold. Similar to the Verge case it has a certified military grade drop protection encase you drop the phone. It\u2019s impact resistant, hard framed with an impact resistant layer so you know the phone will be safe if you drop it. With all VRS cases, it comes with a 1.5 mm protruding front, meaning if you\u2019re the type to sit the phone face down on a table, it won\u2019t get scratched.

For this review I was given 3 cases to test out, all for the S7 Edge. High Pro Shield Series\nOut of the three that I tested, the High Pro Shield is by far my favourite. I reviewed the Steel Silver colour, but it\u2019s basically black with a light shimmer on it. The case has a shock absorbent body to protect the device should it happen to fall off a table or slip out your hand. The High Pro Shield also offers side bumpers with a brushed metal finish. When my S7 Edge is in this case, I feel it\u2019s protected against anything. \nThe case is made from Polycarbonate Thermoplastic Polyurethane and weighs in at 1.2 oz. It feels great in the hand without adding much weight or bulk to the device. \nOne feature I found really useful was the High Pro Shield case protruded by 1.5 mm around the phone, meaning the screen won\u2019t come into contact with any surface if you\u2019re lying it screen down. \nThe case is available in 4 different colours and I\u2019d have no doubt about recommending this phone case to anyone.  Samsung Galaxy S7 Case Edge High Pro Shield Series | VRS DesignCrystal Bumper Series\nWhat I like about the Crystal Bumper Series case is that it offers the phone an all-round protection, but still managing to retain the overall look and design of the S7 Edge, This is thanks to the clear back and metallic bumper sides. The metallic bumper sides match very closely to the phones original look, which is a nice complement. \nThis case is great for protection, similar to the above High Pro Shield Series case; it offers a shock absorbent body as well as a dotted pattern along the inner case to help absorb any impact from falls. It too comes with a 1.5 mm protrude around the front of the phone, which prevents any scratches while it\u2019s lying on a flat surface. \nI reviewed the Satin Silver colour, which is clear in colour. I would recommend this case to anyone who wants an all round protection from drops, but still maintaining the original look of the S7 Edge.    Samsung Galaxy S7 Case Edge Crystal Bumper Series | VRS DesignLayered Dandy Series\nWhen I first put the Coffee Brown Layered Dandy Series on my S7 edge I was instantly impressed. I\u2019ve never been one for flip cases, which offer slots for your cards, but recently I have been enjoying using Android Pay in the UK so I find myself using my wallet less and less. Where the case came in handy was when I could put my drivers licence, one bank card and my work ID pass into the case eliminating the need for me to carry my wallet around. \nThe case, coming in ay 1.9 oz is slightly heavier than the High Pro Shield Series, but I don\u2019t mind the extra weight, especially when it\u2019s complimented with a brilliant leathered texture finish. This case feels good in the hand. \nThe flip case is closed neatly by a magnetic clasp, which seems strong when connecting, giving you that extra comfort that your device and cards are locked away securely. \nIf it weren\u2019t for the awesome High Pro Shield case, the Layered Dandy case would be my number one choice. It\u2019s currently the case I use when I\u2019m out and about and don\u2019t want to carry my wallet with me.

I\u2019m OCD when it comes to the contents of my pockets. I have to have my phone in my left jeans pocket, loose change in the right. Round the back I need to have my wallet in my right back pocket and my work pass in the left. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been, and my jeans have learnt to accept that. \nThat is until I received my SCOTTeVEST cotton hoodie \u2013 a simple design that\u2019s changed the way I carry my goods. \nThis review is based on a large male SCOTTeVEST cotton hoodie, colour black.\nUnwrapping the product, you\u2019re met with a very basic black hoodie (on the surface that is) unzip the hoodie and you\u2019re greeted by pockets galore. You have 10 very cleverly placed pockets, which for the most part I had no issues storing all my gadgets, keys, wallets, sun glasses etc. You have: \n2 very large inside breast pockets, closed together with magnets for easy access. Both pockets have 2 compartments, totaling 4 pockets. I found this useful for holding my phone and ear phones in one side, and my wallet and sun glasses in the next. \nYou then have front hand warmer pockets, which have front and back compartments as well as a top drop feature; totaling 6 pockets. I found this useful for storing my car keys and loose change while keeping my hands free inside the hand warmer section. \nUp at the neck, you have a couple of hoops for your ear phones to slot through \u2013 keeping them tangle free and out of sight \u2013 this feature I loved. \nThe Hoodie comes in two different versions; fleece and cotton. I reviewed the cotton one, which is made from 60% cotton 40% polyester. It\u2019s warm and cool enough to wear in spring / summer / autumn, unfortunately I didn\u2019t get the chance to test the hoodie out in winter conditions. I live in Scotland, UK where we can have several different seasons in one day. The hoodie kept me dry and cool throughout my time using it. \nThe garment is well made, no loose threads or stitching, which should be expected for a hoodie that costs $80. Although the price is a tad expensive compared to your regular run of the mill hoodies, for your money you get a well crafted hoodie with awesome storage facilities, which trumps over any other hoodie I own. \nApart from the price I only really have one issue and it really isn\u2019t an issue to be honest, I couldn\u2019t fit my tablet in the pockets comfortably, which is fine \u2013 when you consider this is a hoodie and I shouldn\u2019t really expect a 9 inch device to fit in it. Of course SCOTTeVEST have a solution for that, their Knowmatic Hoodie can easily hold a tablet as well as plenty of other gadgets.  \nFor the two weeks I wore the hoodie, I commuted to work the most, I also went running with the hoodie and traveled too \u2013 on each occasion I realised that I needed 10 pockets in my life. While running my IPod touch was securely stored in the pocket, with my ear phones tucked away thanks to the small hoops at the neck. When travelling on a plane the hoodie managed to store my passport, boarding pass, loose change and a couple of snacks for the plane. \nDuring my commute to work, I utilized all the pockets to the max, despite carrying my phone, wallet, work keys, work pass, car keys, bottle of water and some loose change it didn\u2019t add much bulk to the hoodie. I didn\u2019t feel the weight as the items were evenly distributed and concealed within the garment. \nEven though the hoodie is designed to hold all your gadgets easily, I also found another really good use for the pockets. I\u2019m a recently new father, my Son\u2019s 8 months old now, I found the pockets really good for storing diapers, baby wipes, a baby cup as well as all my regular gadgets. So for the father and gadget enthusiast in me, this hoodie is the ideal travel companion. Conclusion\nSCOTTeVEST\u2019s pocket galore cotton hoodie is a brilliant buy; it\u2019s a sleek and comfortable hoodie, which can store all your gadgets easily. It\u2019s basic in design, which I like; it\u2019s durable while being light weight. I would have no doubt about recommending this product to anyone. http://www.pntra.com/t/2-266136-1222...e_Cotton.shtmlPros\nVery light weight\nGood for all events; running / travelling / commuting \nWarm and comfortable\nLots and lots and lots of pocketsCons\nMy tablet doesn\u2019t fit easily\nA tad on the pricey side\nThe Tall Guy.", "time": "07-01-2016 02:34 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "VRS Case Review (depreciated)", "thread": [{"postID": "post5236709", "text": "VRS Cases Review\nOur friends over at VRS Design was nice enough to send us some cases to review. Overall, the cases are similar in quality to Spigen or Caseology cases. They aren't as refined as Otterbox, Lifeproof or other high end cases, but those also cost a lot more. With the exception of the wallet case which came in a box, the remaining cases came in a generic gray plastic bag, which you can see in some of the review photos. Case needs are so wide because many people have different needs. I tried to point out what I thought was important, and also provide lots of pictures, so that you can see in detail what it looks like on the phone. The pictures where taken with and without flash, and I picked the ones that looked best. \nPlease click on the links below to see the mini review of each case.\nS7 Edge Triple Mixx Casehttp://forums.androidcentral.com/review-templates-staging-area/692899-vrs-cases-review.html#post5236710S7 Edge Crystal Bumper http://forums.androidcentral.com/review-templates-staging-area/692899-vrs-cases-review.html#post5236715\nS7 Edge Single Fit Casehttp://forums.androidcentral.com/review-templates-staging-area/692899-vrs-cases-review.html#post5237080\nS7 Edge Hi Pro Shieldhttp://forums.androidcentral.com/rev...ml#post5237085S7 Edge Crystal mixx clear http://forums.androidcentral.com/review-templates-staging-area/692899-vrs-cases-review.html#post5237091\nS7 Edge, 10, Note 4 Leather Wallet Casehttp://forums.androidcentral.com/rev...ml#post5238456", "time": "06-23-2016 10:53 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5236710", "text": "Triple Mixx CaseThis is an attractive two-piece case with a clear hard plastic back with clear ridges molded to rubber sides (the buttons are molded into the rubber), and a polycarbonate bumper.
