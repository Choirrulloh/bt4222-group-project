Somewhat easy diy fix. The thing that makes the phone shine isnt the mods but the removable battery i cant tell you how valuable this is even if you don't battery swap so your phone instantly has 100% plus you can get a new battery when yours gets to old and if your charger port or speakers break or get stuff in them $20 later you have a brand new bottom clip/speakers/charger port.

How DARE YOU correct my foul words! How dare you auto-correct a 42 year old profession's f-cking swear words. At the very least it should be programmed to LEARN over time and stop auto correcting my curses. Oh, yeah, I'm sure that there is some un-intuitive way to shut the stupid auto-correct off but I know that the fix will be incredibly difficult to find, like everything on this phone (e.g. the voice-mail recordings cannot be found in the phone function... wtf!?). The voice-mails are hidden on the second screen in a sub-folder... until you find it and move it to where it should be, next to the f-ing phone button. Long story short, if you are trying to find an adequate iphone replacement to save some money... don't. The Android operating systems are NOT even remotely intuitive or user friendly and if you are a current iphone user, the nonsensical interface of the Android OS will likely drive you cuckoo. The phone is also made of very cheap and fragile materials, especially the screen which scratches and cracks if you drop it on a carpeted floor (had my iphone 4S for many years, dropped on concrete while standing 6ft tall, with no scratches and NO cracks). Frankly, I find it offensive that Android and LG would subject consumers to this sorry excuse for a phone. It isn't worth $50, let alone the hundreds of dollars your cell company will charge you. Perhaps I am completely insane but I would much rather pay more money for quality than save a few hundred on a pile of electronic crap. Just for some background... the only reason I switched from iphone was because I was getting tired of Apple releasing iphone updates that made the OS LESS user friendly.

Bootloop was a problem in LG's 2015 flagships. Cheap displays with ghosting was their problem in 2016.\n \r\nI still love my V20 though. I forget it was military-graded for drops and that's why zero flaws when it fell face first to the tile. Even the paint didn't scrape off. My Moto E has been dropped and shows nothing too. My Lumia 640 dropped and shows nothing. Motorola and Nokia build strong phones. My Pixel was dropped inside its holster case. Flawless. My G3 Beat shows cracks on the top after it fell from the bed. G5 shows a dent after one waist high fall INSIDE its holster case. SMH. \n \r\nLG has used cheap plastic or glass that easily dents throughout their G-series going back to Optimus G. Only G2 seemed well-built and it lacked microSD slot, removable battery, and was glossy plastic. G3, G4, G5 aren't  built to withstand drops. G6 is glass. It was only until the V-series is when LG started to care about durability with its military-graded materials but it looks like the V30 will follow the footsteps of the G6.  \n \r\nLike I said before, I will always stick to Android but I have been dual wielding both it and iOS as of late.

So Pixel on Verizon is the one I plan to stay on unless Nokia 8 or Essential Phone can convince me otherwise. \n \r\nStay away from LG unless it the materials are military-graded to withstand drops. Like the Samsung S series, LG G series are built CHEAP. Motorola and Nokia are better engineers for durability and reliability.

I love my silver G5. Underrated at everything including its design. \n \r\nMy G5 did start to have ghosting within three months of having it though. All I did is just use a plain black wallpaper. My lockscreen is plain black but says Android on it. On my Textra app, all black with red accents. On my Nova Launcher settings, I use white background and not night mode.

As long as it isn't a gray background or anything lighter than black. \n \r\nI still LOVE both my G5 and V20. I think my V20 is the best phone because it is feature packed and has a better screen, video recorder, and longer battery life but G5 is my personal favorite and is louder, smaller, and has a smoother UI. I just bought a pair of $41 128gb microSD cards just to future proof them both. Still have 39gb left not including the internal storage (G5 has 14gb left, V20 has 40gb left).

The worst of the Top 4 and I just prefer typing on my G5 more at 5.3\". It also lacks IR blaster which I use everyday. \n \r\nV20 is the best phone LG ever made. The last of its kind for future proofing. G5 is my favorite phone ever made. The V20-mini or what the Galaxy S is to the Note series. \n \r\nV20 (best)  \r\nG5 (favorite) \n \r\nBoth great phones.

I got the AT&T unlocked version from EBAY for around 165 bucks so I didn't pay very much for it and I'm now getting free phone service from FREEDOMPOP. That being said it's a good deal for the price. The SD820 chipset is a little outdated right now with the SD821 and SD835 coming out but it's still a monster for average users. I'm crazy into mobile games so processing power and graphics are very important, and the G5 certainly doesn't disappoint though it's nowhere near the fastest- but then again I paid 165 for it who gives a shit. \n \r\nThing is the V20 is a lot better. It has better audio and video features and the performance is better, though it uses the same chipset. But you're paying $299 for a scum-of-the-earth used variant from EBAY while the G5 pushes $150 in it's lowest configurations. If you're like me and you don't give much of a shit of anything besides PRICE and PERFORMANCE the G5 is a solid bargain. If you want the best of LG you're getting the V20, and if you want the absolute best but don't give a shit about your burdened wallet then the G6 is the way to go. Personally I had to choose long and hard before choosing the G5 over the S7...\n \r\nAnother thing before buying this phone. The bloat is INSANE. I got the AT&T version and it's actually hard to determine which apps are legit and which are not. I hate the fact that you can't uninstall ANY OF IT! Worst part is there's no root for LG G5 available yet- One-click root doesn't work either because the bootloader is locked. The EU and T-MOBILE versions are the only root-compatible ones but I'm pretty darn disappointed I can't root my phone so I can get rid of all that useless crap that AT&T dragged from the deepest pits of hell.

The fingerprint scanner is a gimic and eventually give a countless amounts of issues as well as the power/lock button which currently isn't working on my device in which I will have to send it in for the 4th time...

It overheated so badly in the first month of purchase that I would sometimes have to leave it in my fridge for 10 mins so it wouldnt burn my leg while in my pocket... And sent it in for repairs... Camera, music and video is excellent no complaints there however the apps in general are now shutting down and closing randomly as well as freezing often upon opening them...

Mine is silver anyway which is the best neutral color to hide smudges on matte plastic or metal. And another quality that the G5 has - IT RARELY GETS HOT! \n \r\nI also own a Note 3, Mi 3, Moto E2, Lumia 640, and gold LG G3 Beat. I love having both my LG's next to each other and the G5 perfectly matches with my silver MacBook. The G5 easily surpasses them all my phones. My only qualm isn't the light bleed or screen retention. It is how quite dim it is. I need to put it to 100% brightness to match my Moto at only 60%.\n \r\nThe problem with the critics and blind haters is they were only devoted pointing out the G5's flaws like the gimmicky LG Friends and modular design. They called it a flop or couldn't get over the rear design when it basically looked like the Nexus 6P. But they never pointed out what the G5 did right which were the essentials at making a great phone. \n \r\n- Decent battery life \r\n- Comfortable to hold \r\n- Great camera on par with S7 edge \r\n- Excellent IPS screen \r\n- Loud external speaker \r\n- Good audio all-around \r\n- Great price value  \r\n- MicroSD slot  and removable battery for future proofing storage and usage.\n \r\nThe basics. That's what the G5 got right but all the critics lie to us like the liberal media and want SEXY toss away devices. Skip the G6. No removable battery, no thanks! When LG wanted to be different last year, they got criticized. When they want to be the same ol', same ol' like the rest of them with this G6, they will be criticized. D*mn if you do, d*mn if you don't.  \n \r\nThink about it. The smart money is on the G5. I got mine for only $240 which I paid off entirely two days later after I got it. The S7 edge is considered the best of last year but still goes for $700 and Americans get the Snapdragon 820. The SoC isn't the problem because the G5 and OP3 flies. It is Samsung's lame skin and poor optimization on the Qualcomm's. The camera and battery life might be better on it by a little over the G5, but not $460 better. G5 is a better deal than all those Chinese makers. Mi 5, Axon 7, OnePlus 3, it beats them all... \n \r\nG5 = Most unique, most underrated, most misunderstood, and best all-around flagship of 2016. Ahead of its time.  But a flop because it wasn't pretty enough by fashionistas who judges designs from the rear!  ", "date": "21 Feb 2017"}, {"text": "Planning on moving to Moto Z....

My carrier (EE) and Carphone Warehouse try to sell you the G5 SE when you ask for a pure G5, yet the cash price in store is only \u00a320 less and the contracts similar.\n \r\nThe lower power processor is a MAJOR issue. We all know that for smooth operation, gaming and decent smooth video, a good CPU is paramount.\n \r\nWhen I give advice to friend and family, I say, you want a phone that is: Fast, has a daylight readable display and all day battery. I cannot speak for the 2nd two items, but the SE will not be as fast as the 5G. A compromise has been made to help LG move stock of the original G5, but save them money, so they have switched CPUs.\n \r\nThere is a difference between a genuine budget model of a phone and one that is only slightly tweaked so consumers don't realise. The SE lettering on the box is very small.\n \r\nI think this very dishonest of LG and the carriers and today, I told EE and Carphone Warehouse to their faces and via their call centres that they need to stop doing this.\n \r\nI'm going to order a pure G5 now as it's a great phone (had one before), the only downside being battery life and in my case before, screen was dull outside, but I think it was a one off.\n \r\nHope this advice is helpful!

Only 2800 MaH battery, thought will drain out supporting 1440x2560 pixels with 554 ppi. I was utterly wrong. Extremely good battery, far better than Sony. Lasted almost throughout the day till 9 pm. Very good power management from LG. Kudos. \r\n2. Very fast finger sensor. \r\n3. Camera is awesome! With dual camera and the super wide angle image and the image quality even in low light conditions, it is definitely better than existing Samsung S7 edge and way better than my Xperia Z1. \r\n4. The sound quality without head phones is pretty loud and with the earphones and surround sound mode, it is definitely better than my Z1. I saw a video in you tube that LG friends have HiFi plus which boosts the sound to 32 bit but I think is not currently launched in India. \r\n5.

This included crazy follow up for months and months on Galaxy S7, Huawei P9, Nexus 6P, LG G5, HTC 10, One Plus 3, Xiomi Mi5 and even ZTE Axon 7. I actually bought the G5 finally only on 8 July once on 7 July the ZTE Axon camera review came out and I found the camera on it was crap. Anyways, With my analysis I could conclude the below things- \r\n1) All phones have goods & bads but only the Galaxy S7 & LG G5 are the most complete phones. It comes down to what the actual preferences for a particular person are- tradeoffs are to be made in both phones.  \r\n2) Samsung  spent big time on its marketing campaign (as always) and LG probably spent nothing (as always)- Result- Samsung Kicked LGs butt and now S7 is outselling G5 by the tons (not necessarily because it is better) I could find most reviews biased towards the Galaxy S7 all over the internet. Many a times I almost thought many-many (ahmm..ahmm) were paid to promote the S7 and highly denigrate the G5 to kill competition in the bud. \r\n3) Galaxy S7 is definitely there with better display (Amoled), better themes, really neat and handy tricks and the likes. However all the fuss about design and premium is bullshit- For me Glass is definitely NO PREMIUM. I am yet to come across a person (and there S7 has had a bumper sale here) who does not have a case on his Galaxy S7- there goes the premium design inside a INR 300 ($5) case. The front & back glasses are so-so easy to break if they fall down- Hence, I decided to give it a skip- so much money not worth the risk. My G5 also goes in a case, so no big deal here. Personally I found the dual camera setup enticing, meaning more people noticing my phone. \r\n3) Taking a sum of all positive negative and blind voting contest (most important as here paid things are less likely to work)- G5 definitely has the better camera- even in low light (agreed S7 has faster autofocus) and many-many other diverse conditions. But S7 has taken all the possible accolades for various worthy & sometimes unworthy reasons. The gimmick of scaling down to 12 MP (though enough-but not good) was hyped too much everywhere. I bet they could give 16 MP outright, but they will probably be saving it for Galaxy S8 with dual pixel bluff etc etc. for next year. I think LG did win here on the primary camera alone and that the wide angle camera was also there was just awesome. Made my choice very simple.  Today, when I compare photos shot with my friends S7 edge & my G5 all agree that the G5 photos look much better when viewed on a proper 14-16 inch monitor. Secret- In many reviews, what the reviewers dont tell is that for comparison purposes, the G5 16 MP pics are scaled down to 12 MP for comparing like to like pics with S7 which is unfair-even more so when the reader is not told of the same- So of-course the G5 pics are made to look less than what they originally are. \r\n4) Not helping themselves much, LG further dug their own grave by launching it at around INR 53K in such a HUGE market as India (Just too expensive for the good and bad that G5 offered) when the S7 was selling at INR 49K. Now that they have realised their mistake and normalised the rates by the various freebies & discounts (which I got- listed in earlier comments)- this phone has become a really good buy. I was anticipating such a scenario and grabbed as soon as it came. \r\nAnyways, I still am thank full to all reviewers for they made my understanding of one and all devices so detailed that I could take an educated and informed decision on what is good for me rather than being told what should be good for me.\n", "date": "09 Jul 2016"}, {"text": "Great, I knew lg will pull out a great phone in g5.

I got the lg G5 on pre-order from sprint and received it on March 31st.  I do not like that they made the screen smaller, even though its only a little bit i wish they would have kept the screen at 5.5 but i think the reason behind this is because of the new V line from LG.  Basically i think the v10 is the lg G4 pro version.  My carrier is the only one that does not carry the V10 because i probably would have gotten that phone instead but that phone does have a crappy processor and video GPU just like the G4 does but they did that because the snapdragon 810 had so many problems so they went with the 808.  Second, i don't get why people are saying the screen is so dim, if you look at the brightness specifications, its twice as bright as the G4 and G3.  Now what i will say is the \"auto\" function on the screen brightness doesn't work exactly right and sometimes i will go into the settings and turn the auto function off and back on and that fixes it all the time.  i have no problem seeing the screen at all in full sunlight.  i absolutely love that they kept the removeable battery, so i also don't understand why people were bitching about the smaller battery, they even had a promo that if u bought the phone at a certain time they would send u a free battery and charging cradle.  i used that promo and got my extra battery and cradle and love it.  I also purchased an extra non-oem battery from amazon for $16 bucks.  So now i have three batteries, if it gets close to dying, i simply turn the phone off and swap the batteries.  I NEVER charge the phone (but i did when i first got it and it charges very fast, about an hour and 15 minutes gets a full charge)  Now more about the display, i prefer IPS displays over samsungs amolded.  First, the amolded displays look fake and over saturated.  also the pixels die out over time.  plus the samsungs are usually quite a bit more then the LG devices.  Now that wasn't quite the case this time.  i believe it was still about 100$ cheaper then the regular s7 and 200$ cheaper then the s7 edge.  the g4 was alot cheaper then the samsung s6 and s6 edge but since they have the same processors and ram and gpu i guess they decided to charge more.  Changing the batteries was a pain at first with the weird design but after a few weeks i can change them within a few seconds.  i've read many professional reviews of the g5 and they all say it is by far the fastest as any of the new devices this year.  it has also won awards for the best camera out of all of them too.  i think the main 16mp shooter is the same from the lg g4.  there is an extra 8mp wide angle lens but i am not much on taking pictures, i played with it a little and it seems ok.  I think it also has the same 8mp front shooter as the g4.  The speaker is on the bottom now instead of the back and it seems pretty good, a little better then on the g4's back facing speaker.  overall i really like this phone.  it is extremely fast and does all the things all the other phones do.  i really like that it still comes with a removeable battery as i hate charging my phone even if it does charge really fast.  i had six extra batteries for my g4.  the call quality and reception are great (i am on sprint which is the worst of all the US carriers but it works great, i am usually home on my wifi anyway but i don't use wifi for calling.  I did switch from Tmobile and i got much better service with them but sprint isn't that bad and they are working on improving.  I don't use the second screen option because i have a smart watch but from what i read from reviews its the best out of any phone but still sucks.  I give this phone an 8 out of 10.

Bad in sunlight. \r\n-HTC used to have this function that made the screen brighter in their HTC Amaze 4G when the camera was on. You're taking pictures blind in sunlight with this one. \r\n-Can't make it through an entire day without having to recharge the battery. Usually 2/3rds of the day. \r\n-App drawer is missing (I don't mind it) \r\n-Having trouble syncing 1300+ phone contacts from google sometimes.

I thinks so.  \r\nAfter much talk about the new modular design of the G5, I can say for myself as a NEW OWNER, that LG have got it right.\n \r\nI'm off contract and I purchased a G5 Titan sim free. at \u00a3529 that came with free LG B&O H3 in-ear headphones.\n \r\nThe LG G5 is one phone that can change into many with the add-ons like LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O PLAY and LG CAM - Plus, will make the phone stand out even more.\n \r\nPositives with the new G5 are? \r\nThat this phone will allow you to grow and expand not just with the add-ons from LG Friends Family - which are great but a little expensive. But also with the ability to expand the phones memory from 32BG up to 200 GB with the use of the microSD card slot. Plus you also have the ability to swap-out the phone's battery, if needed. With a spare battery you can always make sure that your have power when needed. Just these two abilities on there own make the phone worth having. Plus the G5's power and design make this a flagship mobile phone worth having and I think well above the Samsung Galaxy S7!\n \r\nNegatives of the G5 are? \r\nWell there aren't many, but over the last 48 hours I've been putting my new G5 through the test. I've changed and played around with most of the phones settings and the G5 hasn't fallen over once. However, what I have noticed is the the fingerprint sensor on my G5 stops working if the phone is either in long periods of standby or when the phone is switched off and then back on. \r\nYes the G5 fingerprint sensor will not operate first time when the phone is turned on. This is a design security feature. But I have also found that my G5 fingerprint sensor has to be reset by deleting the existing fingerprints and re add them, otherwise they will not work. Then the sensor works for the rest of the day. This may be sorted out with an update for the G5. \r\nThe other issue be it a small one is the modular design of the G5. The 2 parts of the phone that separate don't provide a smooth finish when locked back with each other. On my G5 I have one side of the phone where it comes apart higher than the other side. It's not much but you just feel it every time I hold the phone in my hand, it's not a all smooth finish. Thoughts on this are - If you design a phone that has a feature that comes apart make sure that they totally go back together with a all smooth finish, otherwise it makes the phone feel cheap and not a flagship that it is.\n \r\nI rate this 4.5 out of 5 - It's the fingerprint sensor and the not all smooth finish that just let's it down for me.", "date": "22 Apr 2016"}, {"text": "LG G5 is with 2 TB slot not with 200 gb!!\n", "date": "22 Apr 2016"}, {"text": "heating issue there", "date": "21 Apr 2016"}, {"text": "Get the LG G5!", "date": "21 Apr 2016"}, {"text": "Questions. can either Sim be data/phone or both; selectible. one for phone; one data for tethering ?  \r\n2 The contacts-address book are seperate per sim selected ? \r\n3.

And how am I dumb if I like to take care of my phones and dont use a case? I prefer to be able to appreciate the build quality of something I just payed 800 dollars for.\n \r\nDesign: Like you said its a subjective topic, and there isn't a right or wrong answer to this.\n \r\nBattery: Okay it is proven that AMOLED panels are more efficient due to their ability to shut off pixels, give me one source that shows LCD is more efficient as a fact and I'll shut up. And yes the G5 DOES need a better battery, the LG G4 had 3000 MAH and only lasted me a day when I had power saving modes on and monitored my usage very carefully, I can go all out on my Note 5, achieving over 5 hours of screen on time, which my G4 never even got close too, dont even get me started on the g3, both phones lasted only around 3 to 3 and a half hours of SOT, and look this up for yourself I'm not the only one reporting this. Quick charge 3.0 is faster, But remember, you wont need to charge the phone as much, it will last much much longer, but since you're a bit slow, then just wait for the official test's and see for yourself who is going to have better battery life. Quicker isn't always better.\n \r\nCamera Tech \r\nIt shoot's a little better? Ever heard of dual pixel autofocus? it focuses in like one third of the time it takes for the G5. And the G5's main shooter is the same 16 MP we've had before already in the V10 and G4, So it's now LG's THIRD time using this sensor. Rediculous.\n \r\nScreens \r\nI've used over 4 samsung phones in the past year, and none have burn in. My sister's both have Note 4's used from launch day till now, No burn in. My old note 2 on cyanogenmod? No burn in. And it is 100% proven as a fact that AMOLED is the more efficient screen technology. The S7's screen isn't \"marginally\" better, It's leagues ahead in terms of contrast, and ability to reproduce complete black colors. Ask any reviewer in the world out there with an S7, I can guarantee you 9/10 people will say the S7/S7 Edge has the best screen on the market.\n \r\nNavigation keys \r\nAre you an idiot? Have you ever used android? how do you not know what he means? He's saying the S7 doesnt have onscreen navigation keys that eat up screen estate, meaning more of the screen is usable by things like apps.\n \r\nFast charging: \r\nIt hasn't been confirmed yet what the G5 will and wont have in the box since IT'S NOT EVEN OUT YET. Who knows maybe it will have a QC 3.0 charger in the box, if it does that's great but once again I addressed battery issues already ^^^^\n \r\nTouchwiz:  \r\nYou obviously haven't used newer touchwiz, it's alot cleaner and has a full fledged theme store which works fantastic, and offers a slew of features stock android cant match, and LG cant either. And besides, any software feature the G5 has, the S7 can do better. So idk what you're talking about, touchwiz is fine except for a bit of aggressive management which is still a bit hit or miss, but has been mostly fixed for the S7 \r\nModules: \r\nHe's saying to unlock the FULL potential of the G5 you have to buy modules, such as the B&O 32 bit dac which was actually implemented internally in the V10, but now it has to be a module in the G5? But the modules aren't a huge deal any ways and like you said they are optional.\n \r\nSo, in closing, stop being absolutely ignorant.
