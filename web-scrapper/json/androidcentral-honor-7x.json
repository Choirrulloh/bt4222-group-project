I just got 57mbps down on my 5 GHz and about 12 mbps down on my 2.4 GHz band with my Mate 9.

The issue is only resolved if you use a 5ghz (a or ac) access point, then you can have full speed and bluetooth at the same time. This issue is not limited to this device, it also occurs on many notebooks and other phones. \n---------------\nBasically, this is the downside of having a 2.4ghz device. If Honor wouldn't have cheap out and added 5ghz, we wouldn't have experiencing this problem. It's 2017, this shouldn't be optional anymore.

Immediately after turning bluetooth off my speed shot up to 35-45mbps. with Bluetooth on it consistently runs just under 3 mbps.\nNot sure how to feel about this. there are definitely instances I could imagine of bluetooth and wifi being used simultaneously. For example, i'm watching a youtube video in the kitchen on the phone but want decent sound so I bluetooth to speaker. I'm regularly connected to my JBP flip 3 in the kitchen. For a podcast it shouldn't matter, I'm rarely using the phone while listening to podcasts at home. However the youtube video thing could be a real issue.

I dont understand it. If the phone only has a 2.4 antenna, how can a 5 ghz router help?\nthe phone is good enough for the price though that even with the issue I'm most likely keeping it. that and it would be a lot of trouble and expense to return.\nIf a 5ghz router would alleviate the problem and i can find one for like 40 bucks or less, it would probably be worth it to me to solve the issue. My current router ias some linksys I picked up on clearance for like 19 bucks, and it's been solid and reliable for a long long time. So cheap doesn't mean bad.\nalso, my brother has one of those expensive nighthawk routers (I assume this has 5ghz). i was over at his house the other night showing him the issue. the phone was definitely performing different. i dont recall it dropping below about 10 mbps, but OTOH that's no great shakes.

It would have been ideal to take a video of the phone in action as soon as you saw the issue, because the timestamp of the video might have helped show them that you didn't have the phone for very long before the problem started (just something to remember in the future). The problem is that there's no definitive way to prove that the phone wasn't exposed to water while in your possession, so it's essentially your word against theirs.\nWhen you talk to a higher level of customer service, try buttering them up and talk about how excited you were to get your 7X, and how you were hoping to continue using Honor products in the future.
