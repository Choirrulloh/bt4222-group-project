Sound in portrait mode through the one speaker is only average.  \n\r\nThe Bluetooth audio seems so far to be an improvement over the Mate 10 Pro which had a horrible compressed almost 128k sound even playing 320k files through Deezer.  The P20 Pro seems much closer to the quality on the iPhone 7 which is great news so far but I will report back once I have tried some FLAC files on the internal audio app.\n\r\nOther than that the phone seems slightly quicker than the Mate 10 Pro, possibly due to the newer EMUI version.\n\r\nUpdates to follow after more time with it", "time": "07 April 2018, 05:07 PM", "postID": "post76145080",
