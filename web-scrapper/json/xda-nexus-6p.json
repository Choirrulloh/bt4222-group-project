If I'm being honest, I find it a touch slippy in the hand and I'm quite worried about dropping the damn thing, but I'm hoping a case will make this better...once it arrives!\nPerformance: Excellent. Zero lag, zero slow down.\nBattery: Coming from the Nexus 5, it's really good. This was actually my primary reason for buying this over the Nexus 5x - bigger phone == more room for battery, and so far this shows. Today has been a light-use day, to be fair, but still sat at 76% at 8pm is just awesome. My Nexus 5 wouldn't do that well even if I didn't use it all day...in flight mode...switched off. Exceptionally happy here.\nStability: Have had the phone for 7 days, uptime: 7 days. Nuff said.\nCamera: Too early to say, but I don't think it's quite as great as everyone says it is. There's still no way in the app to do manual control (e.g. shutter priority for capturing pictures of fast moving objects) so the results still look, well, like they've been taken with a phone. That's not to say it's bad - it's certainly better than the Nexus 5, which was leagues better than the Nexus 4 - it's just...average. Give us some manual control, Google! Lens Blur still takes great shots and it's very responsive, so I would give it a B at the moment, with scope for more in future.\n\nThe only elephant in the room is the size. OK, so this isn't the phone's fault and I knew what I was getting, but don't kid yourself that it's anything other than a big phone. I picked up my old N5 the other day and, frankly, it still feels the \"right\" size for a phone.

Found out about the bootloop of death and poor battery later.  Still work with my Nexus 7 2012 3G and N7 2013 LTE.  They're still serviceable \nwith custom ROM's.  Took a trial with a Blu Studio G Plus and got it rooted with one of the \"commercial\" mods I think King Root or something like that.   Am afraid to do a custom ROM as no one can find stock ROMS that are \neasily accessible for BLU stuff I can trust.  It was a $49.00 phone so no big deal.  Still works.  The Nexus stuff is straight forward to root and that's why I went with the 6P.  Don't know if I would have bought it if I was aware \nabout the \"issues\" that that's o.k.\n\nWell after upgrading adb on my Linux laptop (the old Ubuntu stock adb didn't have fastboot) , I got the boatloader unlocked and rooted..  Then stuck the 8.1.0 OPM 5.17-xxxx latest in and it works fine. Rooted with Magisk. Well that was simple.  Am doing a battery run and seeing how it performs.  I haven't had any issues yet and do like it.  Am prepared to deal with the bootloop but I guess the new stock ROM probably has that addressed.  It's nice and I take pride in seeing how well some of the old hardware performs with updated ROMs.  Sheesh the N7 2012 3G is a little slow at loading up XSDL/GnuRoot and the linux program Xastir but once it gets going, it's pretty decent.  The N7 2013's do a bit better with speed even though they are old.\n\nOnce I do some run tests I'll determine whether or not the battery needs a changeout.  Am like others that I don't want to lay out big $$$$$$ that the purveyors of this \"heroin-ware\" engineer to be disposable once something gives out.\n(ie. an involved battery swap out on the 6P)  I've swapped batteries out on my other Nexus tablets with little difficulty but the 6p is a little more involved.

With very light use yesterday while on a five hour drive I was seeing values like 3% per hour while streaming BT audio (no nav, screen off, controlling playback via steering wheel-mounted controls). Going up I didn't use the phone except for checking the weather and saw something like 1.5% per hour.\n\r\nSo far this morning at work, where I usually hardly use the phone at all, I'm seeing something like 1.9% per hour just occasionally turning on the screen to check for texts/e-mails (SoT so far, 4 hours into my day is about 45 minutes). The best my Note 5 EVER did, impersonating a brick on my desk, was maybe 3.5% per hour. At the end of the day, with about 2 1/2 to 3 hours of SoT it would usually have 10%-15% left, so I would say the endurance of the 6P is astounding.\n\r\nI am concerned however about the dramatic effect using the camera has on this. I spent about 15 minutes playing with the camera last night before and 15 minutes after installing Nougat and noted a huge amount heat being generated with the resultant power consumption of over 15% in just those few minutes. I get that the processor is working hard on processing  but this is one area the Note 5 is better. While the 6P is so much more efficient overall than the Note 5 (running MM), I use the camera a lot while traveling and occasionally for work, and I'm worried that it will so dramatically reduce it's endurance that it'll die on me halfway through the day. I'm going to Singapore for a week next for a week and so far I don't think the 6P will be the phone I take only for this reason. I was hoping that with Nougat Google would have improved the efficiency of the camera app/photo processing but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\r\nI would go so far as to say this may drive me to return it.", "time": "1st August 2016, 05:25 PM", "postID": "post67997828", "replies": []}, {"text": "After few days of light use I can finally share more details.

It may be a Samsung panel but it's not the same one as used by Samsung on their devices. Even Anandtech have mentioned it uses different lamination which actually provides slightly better viewing angles. What's strange is that the more off angle you go, the lighter the surface appears.

Before I explain: Most of the time I'm in areas where multiple networks are in range. My ISP also has WiFi spread out, which is good when stationary but not so good when driving and the phone can't hop WAPs fast enough nor does it give up trying...\n\nWhen connected to 5 GHz with a good signal and not many other networks in range: I get great throughput. This means WiFi often works very well at home. But the problems start when there is ambiguity about if the phone should connect to a particular network, or if it should fail over to the mobile network. \nFor example, there are times when it prefers the 2.4 GHz network for no apparent reason, instead of my usual 5 GHz coming off the same router. Other times it will prefer a distant 2.4 GHz network over either WiFi signal at home. I have to switch manually when I notice what is happening. \nSometimes it refuses to connect to the \"Saved\" network, despite showing a strong signal. I have to turn WiFi off and on, and try to connect manually to get back on track. \nIn areas with many networks in range, it won't connect to the preferred saved one if I don't select it and connect manually. If I'm really unlucky the saved network doesn't show on the list until I turn WiFi off and on a couple of times to force the list to refresh.\n\nBut what really bothers me is how Location Services gets less accurate with WiFi on. Waze falls behind if WiFi is enabled while driving. This happens in metro areas with at least a few networks in range. My Galaxy S7 was smarter about if and when to maintain spotty connections. I suspect my problems have more to do with the firmware and/or Android itself.

After doing a good amount of research last night I found that the \"Enhanced 4G LTE Mode\" under settings/more/cell networks was causing my issue.  Seems it tries to produce HD quality sound over LTE connection and when that connection is weak the connection either drops, sound is choppy, or the person on the other end can't hear you at all.  Turning this off I was able to make calls from my basement and it cleared up the \"tunnel/echo\" sound I was having when making calls not only from my basement but from anywhere.  Now the big problem with turning this off is your no longer able to talk on the phone and use data.  For someone like me this is kind of a deal breaker as I work in IT and i'm on my phone and hot spot quite often.  I'm still hoping that my replacement phone clears up this issue but i'm guessing it won't.

Compared to my S5, it seemed to get about the same signal strength everywhere. But I have an area I camp at in our RV. Same spot has been assigned to me for years. The coverage there is always very spotty, so we bought a cell phone booster setup from Wilson electronics years ago to enable us to get an okay data connection/hotspot there. This last weekend was the first test of the 6P there, and it was a failure. It would drop the signal often and I could not get any work done. Could make calls and text, but hotspot was kind of cold. \n\nLuckily, I was able to get my wife to bring my S5 down to camp when she came, and I had Verizon switch them for me. Then I was able to get a good, steady connection. While I'm a little disappointed by all of that, it's not a deal breaker for me. Fortunately, I have the S5, which is a perfectly fine smartphone, to fall back on when I do these trips where I need the booster setup to work. And it's a simple matter to switch the phones. \n\nBottom line, there is no question the 6P has a bit weaker signal strength than an S5, at least.
