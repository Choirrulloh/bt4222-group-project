So far I'm really happy. The phone has excellent build quality for a phone that has a removable battery. It's thin and light albeit slightly tall. \nI love the QHD screen, it may not be AMOLED but it is an excellent LCD panel with vibrant colors and it really looks great. I do have slight light bleed from the second screen but it doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I'll accept that to have the extra screen and I really hope LG keeps this feature in future versions of the V series. Though I do agree that LG should move to AMOLED for the next version in the V series lineup.\nI've enabled the app drawer and have found the LG skin to be a pleasant experience with its customization options and themes. Certainly a step up from the G4. The phone is really fast and the audio is absolutely amazing.\nI love having true dual sim with a memory card slot. Signal quality on wifi and LTE is excellent.\nAs for the camera's, I haven't spent much time testing them out yet but so far the image quality looks great and the wide angle lens is awesome despite the lower resolution.\n\nSo, I'm still experiencing the phone and testing out the various features but overall I really think LG did a great job with the V20 and I'm very happy with it so far.\n\nWhat else would I have liked?

Coming from a Samsung ATIV SE Windows phone with Win10 Mobile.  \n\r\nSo far I like the build quality of the phone. Feels solid, glad it is not super thin like some of the new phones.  Hate that, do designers think people are a bunch of wimps that can't hold anything over a 5mm thick?\r\nThe screen is good.  I am not one that really cares what type of screen I have, whether its OLED or LCD.  As long as I can read it, I am good with it.  \n\r\nGuess my biggest disappointment is with the OS.  I have been away from Android on a phone, though I have three Android tablets, plus an Ipad for work and a 8\" Windows tablet for tinkering.\r\nI am NOT IMPRESSED with Android 7.0.  The camera app on the V20 is good, but the processing software makes for some rather crummy pictures, either in auto or manual mode.  Too much noise if you barely zoom in.  Not real impressed right now after spending a couple days trying to get good with the camera.\n\r\nAs far as Android in general,  there is too much fragmentation, almost too many apps trying to do the same function, while all of them doing it rather poorly.  I don't need 5 different file managers, I just need one that does what I want it to do.  Same with web browsers.  How many do you really need?\n\r\nGuess I am just used to using my phone as a phone first, work tool second.  I don't have all the gee whiz apps like Instagram, Snapchat, and all that garbage.  I use my phone for specific functions and I want apps that do it right the first time.\n\r\nHopefully by the time my contract is up on this phone, Verizon will be off CDMA and fully switched to their version of GSM.  Then maybe some phone makers will start making Windows phones for their network again.  Going to be a long 2 years for me.  May just sell this V20, and go back to my ATIV SE for the duration.

Too much fragmentation in Android, period. Minimal quality controls.  Instead of one or two really good apps to do a specific function, you have 15 or 20 that are at best mediocre apps.\r\nI blame the majority of that on having Java as the main app language for Android.  Any 12 year old can write code for Java, doesn't mean it is clean, concise, efficient code.  Same with apps. Just because it was easily written, doesn't mean it is a good app.\r\nAre there bad examples of other type of code?  Of course, but Java seems to be the most prevalent from what I have seen.\n\r\nAlso the few apps that I have on Android now that I had on my Windows phone, mainly the Office and MS related ones, are not that great actually.

SD808 to SD820 is no comparison.   V20 is a solid improvement in battery life, especially in standby. It still guzzles juice like none other when taking pictures especially recording video, however.   The V10 was lacking in all-day usability.  The V20 is up there with how my Note 4 used to be under KitKat before Samsung ruined its battery life with a series of increasingly buggy software updates.  \n\nI like the larger font and extra brightness of the 2nd screen and at least on my units, the V20's Second Screen has less light bleed than my V10's. I preferred the physical design and textured back of the V10.  The V20 is way too slick without a case.   Ideally, I'd have rear volume buttons and where the battery release button is on the V20 would be a dedicated camera shutter button or some kind of assignable multi function button.   Wide angle camera isn't the best quality but has been surprisingly useful on the V20 and is quickly becoming a essential feature.   \n\nV20 charges with inconsistent speeds but overall much faster than the V10, even on an old non-QC  1A charger I have in my office.  \n\nCall quality and reception on the V20 is better than the V10.   \n\nI wish the V20's screen was a little brighter at maximum brightness and a little dimmer at lowest setting.   I REALLY miss not having at least the option for wireless charging on the V20.  I have Qi pads all over the house from my Samsung days that are now useless.  \n\nThe camera on the V20 is a little better than the V10's for stills and a lot better in video but results in Auto mode still leave much to be desired.  The camera can be incredibly slow to launch and take pictures, especially on multiple shot to shot sequences.  Not being able to mute the camera shutter noise is SO annoying!  Samsung has had it since the GS5 I believe.  I love being able to adjust the screen density in Nougat. Finally I can shrink down the onscreen nav buttons at least somewhat!  \n\nOverall I am happier with the V20 than I was with the V10 but there's still plenty of room for improvement  by LG.", "time": "6th January 2017, 03:01 PM", "postID": "post70423005", "replies": []}, {"text": "Considering this phone.

If so which ROM do you recommend? \n\nOverall that is my only gripe about the phone.  I love the DAC and for all you music lovers out there try Sirius XM on the LG-V20 and make sure to use Hi-Fi made headphones. I bought myself Bowers and Wilkens P7's, sort of pricey but worth it to me. The other thing is Napster as well the songs you download sound awesome with this DAC. For both of these APPS make sure you go into settings and adjust the quality of the downloads and streaming. Otherwise you could be listening to it with poor quality settings from the get go.\n\nOk well I appreciate any help or advice on my battery situation! \nThanks in advance to anyone helping me out.\n--- Gary", "time": "10th February 2017, 12:22 AM", "postID": "post70960243", "replies": [{"text": "Any charger that says Quick Charge 3.0 would work.

And I'm from NYC so I'm into name brands & the best quality a bit more.\n\nI must say, I NEVER owned a LG product before. I always saw them as a cheap brand with cheap parts IMO. And I was HIGHLY upset when I was forced to give up my Note 7 for it(just finally gave in a week ago because of that annoying update lol)\n\nNow when my V20 first arrived, I was mad...for the lack of a better term lol. I hated the color and the build, I got used to the shiny Samsung phones especially that blue coral so beautiful geez.\n\nI've had every Galaxy Note since the Note 2, no other phone. I'm a man of habit, and I don't like change much. Just always thought the Note series was the best phone every year\n\nNow back to the V20, the same day I received it...I almost took it back lol. I literally walked into the T-Mobile store a hour after I got it, looking to get an iPhone. I figured I'll just switch it up & suffer until the New Note comes out\n\nLong story short I couldn't do it, and decided to give the V20 at least 2 days...it's only fair right? Now I must say, it's been a week and I'm very impressed with this phone.\n\nThe secondary screen is so awesome, it reminds me of the first Galaxy Note Edge...with the REAL EDGE. Makes the screen look even bigger as a whole, looks like it's 7 inches\n\nAlso when I received a phone call randomly & saw it didn't take over my main screen and was in the secondary screen it felt heaven sent lol...I was sold after that.\n\nIMO, coming from the AMOLED screens on the Notes...for some reason I like the V20's cooler flat screen better. Side to side with my Note 7, the Note looks so yellowish & warm.\n\nIt's funny how you can just be stuck on something by habit, and then you can just see an entire different world when you try change \ud83e\udd14.\n\nOverall this is an awesome phone, LG's UI is better IMO...and stuff like screenshots are so much better. I just wish the build was better, if LG can make this phone shiny & pretty next year...I would consider buying it over The New Note.\n\nWith that being said idk, I see people are getting horrible on screen time...my on screen time is pretty amazing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------- Post added at 06:29 PM ---------- Previous post was at 06:20 PM ----------\n\nEasily one of the best batteries I've ever had, if not the best.

The Note7 is a standard for \"true black\" because it is actually true black. An LED/OLED/AMOLED/etc display accomplishes black by simply shutting off an LED pixel, thus creating a 100% TRUE black. (Also, LED being off is using 0 energy).\n\r\nLCD's on the other hand require backlighting, thus anytime the screen is on, the entire thing is lit. This is why no LCD will ever accomplish a 100% true black. It's also the reason why LCD's tend to be more of a battery hog because all pixels, even black ones, require lighting which requires energy.\n\r\nTo see the difference, put an AMOLED and LCD screen phone beside each other in a dark room and do a google image search for 000000, click one of the results and view it full screen.
