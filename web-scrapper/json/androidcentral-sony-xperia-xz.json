Had the phone for a while for review, and I liked it more that I though I would. I was really hating on the bezels, the chrome finishing, etc. But I got hold of the black unit, and ended up liking it.\nIt's still way too big for me, and the bezels are rather big, but it's around the same as the U11 or the iPhone 7 Plus, so it's not really an outlier here. Other than that, the phone is really solid. The 4k screen is an overkill for normal viewing distance, but it's still amazing to look close up and see how dense this screen is. \nThe performance is really good too, with Sony's UI being pretty lean, almost close to stock android. The touch response, app launch speeds, gaming performance are all top notch, and feels speedier than the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. The battery life is surprisingly decent too despite the 4K screen. Sony is probably upscaling 1080p most of the time unless there is a need to display native 4k. Average around 5 hours of Screen on time over a full day of use. Or once I tried really heavy use with lots of gaming and some camera use, got 7.5hours screen on time over 10 hours of use. Pretty decent.\nCamera is going to be a bit polarising. Some like the image processing, some just hate it. I used to hate Sony's processing and their camera UI having used most generations of their phones like the Z3, Z3 Compact, Z3+, Z5, Z5 Compact, X, and X Compact. But I can definitely see the improvements over the years. I have no issue with their daylight shots now in full auto mode.\nI do agree with Andrew in his review that Superior auto mode can be a bit finicky, but it worked fine for me most of the time. I also find that there is a setting to change the touch to focus to adjust the brightness too, so essentially spot metering. For me the camera works better that way, but pity that there isn't an easy way to slide and adjust exposure like most phones.\nThe only downside is that low light shots still isn't up to par compared to the other flagships. It still looks good to me, but just that when you pixel peep, it's easy to tell that the camera has to go for higher iso and faster shutterspeed to compensate for the lack of OIS. The aperture not being as wide, might be a factor too. So the images doesn't seem to have as much details with softer edges, more grain, and noise. But it's still good looking enough though.\nIt does have other things to make up for that drawback though. Sony's steadyshot in daylight and 1080p looks mightily steady, and might be the best stabilisation I've seen on a phone. And the 960fps camera is extremely fun to play around with. It can be challenging to get the timing right, but incredibly satisfying once you do.\nI have the full resolution images on Google Photos shared here:https://photos.google.com/share/AF1Q...JPWUVJMkZBSG13\nAnyway, sorry for the really long post, but just want to share my thoughts on the phone. For those who don't want to read, i do have a video review up as well.\n(the lack of a fingerprint sensor to me is a deal breaker in the US though) \nHopefully when a XZ Premium sub-forum does come about the mods can help to move it to the correct spot.", "time": "06-11-2017 10:57 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5847396", "text": "Just to add on a bit, I have seen a few other reviews since then, and mine's probably a bit more positive than others. I have no doubt that it has its flaws, and on paper the Galaxy S8 is probably one of the best phones around. Looks stunning too. But when it comes down to actually using the phone in a day to day situation, the XZ premium is just as good to me. Performance feels smoother, and interface looks cleaner too. And the unique feature (960fps) is actually really fun to use. Sony does have some ways to go still, and i totally get some of the hate around, but it's not a bad phone.\nAlso in Singapore where I live, the price of a XZ premium at resellers are around SGD850, so around 615USD? And it's actually a little bit cheaper than the S8. So it's actually not a bad deal here. At 799USD and without fingerprint sensor, you should probably avoid it.", "time": "06-11-2017 11:10 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5848181", "text": "Thank you for your review.

Unless they change their image processing to be more like Google's HDR+ mode perhaps.\nSize wise the iPhone 7 Plus is around the same size too actually, along with HTC U11.

Strangely enough.\nIt's heavy, but it isn't too heavy. I used an iPhone 7 Plus with a pretty bulky case on for months so this is fine for me.\nThe chrome is a bit out there, as it is basically a mirror, but I think this version looks so much better than the shiny black.\nThe phones screen is basically the star attraction for me. I don't think I've ever used a mobile phone with as good a screen. Colours are just amazing, they look natural, smooth and crisp and no matter what you are looking at on this phone, it looks great.\nThis leads me onto another reason I love it - customisation. I love changing my wallpapers, and this phone basically looks good no matter what wallpaper you throw on. The more colourful the better though for me, as it really shows that display off. Also, Sony themes have always been a reason I've liked their devices. I downloaded a Spider-Man one which coincides with the new film and it's pretty cool. Doesn't change things too much, such as buttons etc (as some go wayyyy overboard) but the moving wallpaper is awesome.\nBattery life so far has more than surpassed my expectations. I am really pleased at how all the big manufacturers recently are managing to get a lot more out of their batteries than previous devices. I can't think of a flagship this year that has been criticised for poor battery (could be wrong?) which is great to see.\nWith the 4k display here, I expected to be needing the charger come 8pm, but no such case at all. You can see what kind of usage I'm getting below. Huge thumbs up.\nThis was unplugged at around 7am.\nCamera. Well I half expected to be disappointed but I couldn't be more wrong. Sony really do seem to have taken some strides compared to the XZ that I had last year. I don't really know what they'e done, but this is now a much more reliable shooter than that was. It takes photos pretty quickly and whilst there is still too much processing done after the shot is taken, results can be impressive. Attached some below.\nThese ones were all taken in fairly low lighting. Both outside and in. I used the phone at a wedding and a lot of people were complimenting the front facing camera as we took selfies (I won't share those... haha). They all had iPhones... I'm saying nothing.\nReally impressive results. It hasn't disappointed me once yet, and it has been used in real social instances where I wouldn't want it to let me down. Very impressed.\nI have been tinkering with the slow motion video recording and it can be tricky if you need to slow the video down at the exact second. However tonight I nailed it with my sister throwing the dog a treat which I slowed down at the exact time he dived and caught it in his mouth!  It looks great. I'll upload that when I figure out the best way, might just have to be YouTube. It's such a cool feature.\nAs I mentioned when I got the phone, the speed of the device is blazing. No slow down or hang up at all which I knew was going to be the case after reading a lot of reviews which all said the same thing.\nIt handles everything you can possible throw at it with ease, and I'm comparison I can now notice the very small hiccups and stutters on my KEYone.\nI'm a big fan of Sony putting Google now into their software so when you swipe to the left of the home screen you're right there. I think that's a great feature to be built into the phone, and I use that almost daily.\nThings I don't like?\nWell I could really do without all of that Sony bloatware. We're lucky in the UK that carriers don't add anything to devices like they do in the US. But Sony has about 9 apps for all sorts of different things and it is just excessive and annoying. They notify me all the time, despite me being sure I had turned them off. You can disable them, and also delete them but it's annoying that they are there. Although things like Sony's weather app looks really good:\nI don't like there is no night filter built into the OS. Loads of Android devices do this now and I would get a lot of use out go it. Shouldn't have to be downloading a third party one.\nOn screen buttons. Annoying as you lost a good bit of screen. Not a problem with some devices but when you have that chin, and then the space for buttons and then your on screen keyboard, typing can get a bit 'reachy' despite lowering the VKB height. I can't lower it too much, otherwise it is basically unusable as I'm no fan of VKB at the best of times! \nNo double tap to wake? Why Sony. It was on my XZ? Double tap to sleep is there, but no wake. Odd.\nNo lock screen notifications. This goes hand in hand with the above. My KEYone had lock screen notifications and when I had a notification the screen would kind of half come on and just display a black background with white text detailing the notification. None of that here. So this is where double tap to wake would help so I could easily reach over when it's on my desk to quickly check if I was needing to reply to something. Instead I have to press the power / unlock button to do that, which is really annoying.\nThose niggles aside, I am enjoying this phone a lot. I should have known seeing how much I liked the XZ, but this is in a whole other ball park. I personally think it is one of the best looking phones in years, which is odd given the criticism\nit has had because of the bezels. But for me, it's a winner in the looks department.\nHope this helps anyone who is considering the phone .\nSorry for the length of post, I do tend to go one when I get excited about new tech!", "time": "07-02-2017 05:26 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5927955", "text": "How's it going with your XZ premium now? 2 months since you purchased it.\nAm currently looking into it as a possible purchase.\nThanks.", "time": "08-18-2017 04:34 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5872084", "text": "Great review!

The Camera on this phone is stunning, amazing DIS (even if you move, just re-tap the physical shutter button- it refocusses).. its actually got better stablisation than some OIS devices)... and unlike 80% of other phone cameras, it actually focusses where you tell it too \"touch the screen\" , which means when doing MACRO shots of flowers or small objects.. it actually focusses on that area producing some awesome Bokeh and almost \"3D\"-like effects. \nHowever, the camera in \"Superior Auto\" can be hit and miss, but very simple adjustments in Manual Mode is what makes it amazing.. so Outdoors.. ISO 50 / 100 ... Indoors (daytime) 200 / 400 .. and lowlight..800... but IMO, dont go higher than 800 ISO for any situation.. and thats all you need really, the rest, youll learn as you go... IMO, if you learn to use this camera, it can be truely stunning \n- White Balance is accurate, with lush greens and lovely blue skies,, shutter is nice and fast and low-light is actually really good...\n- The stereo speakers are reasonably loud and punchy, but not too harsh or tinney.. although the waterproof membranes prevent a fatter, rounder mid-range.. but theyre great for podcasts or late night listening... Sadly, ringtones and notifications still not that loud.. I wish SOY would sort that out. \n- The 1080p Screen is excellent and gets very bright.. it actually looks like the image is floating on the screen at times, even in direct sunlight its very good.. but like every phone could be better.\n- Ive only had this phone 2 days so cant comment on Battery life, but so far its pretty good..\n- The UI is clean and fast, and incorporates Google Now and Assistant as a main home screen, so no fiddling with multiple companions and assistants.. SONYs Walkman player, audio section and excellent headphone audio is here as well, with Spotify built in.. if you want it.. although I prefer the more mature UI of Deezer..\nIm really pleased with it.. and at the moment, your can get it for really cheap to contract \u00a324 a month in UK, plus its running build 41.2.A.2.223 (711), so the OS has matured with lots of fixes over the months.. something which the XZs and XZ premium wont have had.\nI was offereed the XZP when I bought this, but wouldve had to pay an extra \u00a3150 upfront, was almost tempted, but so glad I didnt.. because who needs 4k on a 5.5\" screen anyway\nCheers", "time": "06-04-2017 10:47 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5842895", "text": "Is this a XZ or XZs ?\nI have a XZ and the only complaint that i have with the camera (well actually two) is: \n- the extreme oversharping and associated artifacts.\n- no RAW output available", "time": "06-08-2017 02:43 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5839456", "text": "Well, I'm still on the fence between the XZP, XZS and the U11.

Im in the UK, and Im running UK Unbranded build 7.120 (Security: Aug), and the same stands for this phone as for my previous XZ, with additions....\nOn my XZP, Im not seeing any distortion or warping on images taken with the default camera app, although I did read that SONY had released an Update to fix this.. The images are clean and crisp, with great white Balance.. however I have noticed slight softening and even mushy at the far edges of the images on RARE occasions, but IMO, its the subject that i take the shot for and the far edges dont concern me... but you do get this with wide angle lenses anyway. A good ratio ide say would be 1 - 5% from the edge is acceptable... anything over 5% ide replace your xz, but what is surprising with the camera is the Superior Auto Mode ACTUALLY works.. yep, its true.. Every single xperia phone Ive ever owned... its always been tinckering with the , ISO, EV.. of Manual to get something reasonable, however, SONY, have actually pulled this one off, so well done SONY, although according to SONY and web reviews, they say the XZPrem camera tech has been re-built from scratch, instead of just an Upgrade / Update.\nAudio is also fantastic, nice rounded sound at about 70-80% volume, using the phone body as a chamber (The phone vibrates in hand), but again... I had read many complaints about the Audio, especially, ringtones and Notify volumes being too quiet, so whether SONY have listened and theyve increased the volumes, I cant say... but to me... they sound great loud enough \nFor Music, its not as loud, but quality is on par, if it not better than an iPhone 7+, yet not quite as punchy or loud as the HTC U11. But best of all...\nIT HAS A HEADPHONE JACK... YAYY, Thank you SONY for the Love, and not being Stupid.. Speaking of Headphones and Audio, the sound is stunning.. and the Noise Cancelling is in the phone as well as a High End DAC, so Your headphones really do sound fantastic.\nAnd the best till last.. That Screen.. Its gorgeous, although scaled down to 1080p on day-today running, it really looks great on 4k, when you can find some that is .\nBattery life is V.good, on light to moderate use, I get 2 - 3 days out of a full charge and a 1 and a half on heavy use, so im happy.\nDont get me wrong, its not perfect.. occasionally the camera messes up big time and some images have bad camera shake, even though you were rock still... ringtones can sound very Compressed and wierd through the speakers,.... it can feel massive and awkward in the hand with no real style or shape (ala HTC or Samsung), but its all worth it IMO.\nI highly recommend this phone, it looks gorgeous (Deep Sea Black) and, even though the shape remains the typical SONY Slab of Glass.. it turns heads and is a welcome sight from the morass of iPhones and Samsungs everywhere, so its nice to feel a bit unique and different.", "time": "09-18-2017 02:43 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5981809", "text": "Thanks for this review.

Perhaps it's true of other Android handsets too, but it was certainly never an issue with my previous Blackberry Priv. \nThe Google search suggested that turning off noise supression was a possible solution, but there's no option to do that as far as I can see. \nAs I say, this has happened on several occasions, whether I've had full 4G signal, or been connected via my femtocell (with a super-fast fibre connection). \nI know the ability to make calls seems to be quite low down the list nowadays, but it's quite important to me.

The phone is as naked as the day it was born...due partly to Sony not releasing cases at the same time as the phone! But it can't be that. \nI played around last night leaving myself voicemail messages (I don't have friends) and could hear the problem in a few messages...but not all. I then started to cover and uncover the secondary mic, but it seemed to make no difference....the sound would still drop out but not with any correlation to whether the secondary mic was covered. \nA bit more googling suggested turning \"Ok Google\" off, which I've done and so far the problem's not happened again. Whilst it makes no sense that something like \"Ok Google\" could make a difference, neither did the thought that Sony would knowlingly release phones with this problem, so it does seem to make sense to me that it's a non-Sony-software related issue.
