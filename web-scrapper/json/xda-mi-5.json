Only negative point I could mention: After some days of use I recogniced a clicking sound when I softly push the center of the backside glas (ceramic). \n\nThe Software in my opinion can compete with Samsung (there I have the direct comparison) and other brands. In some Points it's better, in some points it's a little behinde the concurence. \n\nMy impressions in detail:\nPositive:\n+ An amazing feauture added in 6.8.11 is the \"Dual Apps\" function in the settings menu. If you have dual sim, thats a extreamly important feauture. Otherwhise you cannot use WhatsApp on both Numbers. Whit MIUI 8 you can. And this whitout using WhatsApp clones as WhatsAppGB (which I used bevore MIUI 8). (I don't know if other DualSim Devices have this feauture)\n+ I've bought the Nillkin Backcover (black) and the Nillkin Flipcover. (Dark Grey) Both are great but the Flipcover is quite glossy, what I dont like.\n+ I've bought an USB-C to USB 3 (female jack) cable to connect external storage (for TWRP-Backup etc.) and other devices. I wasn't able to save the TWRP-Backup direct on the external storage, so I made an internal backup and copied it to an external fat-harddrive. The main thing is, that I have an external backup (whitout MicroSD-Cardslot a little challange)\n+ IR Sensor to controll HiFi and TV! ZaZa remote is my favourit App to use it.\n\nNegative:\n- No possibility to distinguish the SMS-Inbox of the two mobilenumbers. Sure, there is this little \"1\" or \"2\" behind the date. But what I would like to see is a \"Dual App\" for the Messages-App, a possibility to filter the messages by mobilenumber or two tabs on top of the Display where I can choose the two SIM-Cards. Anything like that would be verry nice! \n- MIUI don't give me the possibility to add an App-Link into two different folders on the homescreen =(\n- No support of ExFat formated storage via USB-C (nor NTFS or HFS+) Any tip to solve this is verry welcome!\n- E-Mail App does allow me to add different arriving IMAP and outgoing SMTP server but have NO possibility to add a different login for these two servers. A verry important feauture for me. (My Samsung was able to make this difference). Any hint is verry welcome! I've tried some other E-Mail Apps but didn't find one that can handle all my needs.\n- No MicroSD Cardslot. You could say it's not necessary when you have 128GB internal storage, but for example the backup-process would be easyer with it.\n\nFazit:\nAlltogether I am happy with my new device. It is, what I was looking for. The devices helps me to disassociate Job and Personal contacts whitout a second mobile. In some Videos i've seen, that it is more or less repairable and the replacement parts are available in the \"bay\", an important criterion I guess.\n\nEdited:\nWhen I was writing text, I had this annoying red lines under words which weren\u2019t known by the System. I wasn\u2019t able to find a menu-point to switch them off. My search engine helped me out with this Link. You have to open an adb shell and enter \u201esettings put secure spell_checker_enabled 0\u201c. With \u201esettings put secure spell_checker_enabled 1\u201c you can switch them back on, if needed.", "time": "14th August 2016, 05:51 PM", "postID": "post68186017", "replies": [{"text": "Thanks for your review. \r\nWhat are the features of the e-mail app that make it superior to other e-mail apps such as Gmail, Cloud Magic or Blue Mail ?", "time": "30th August 2016, 02:08 PM", "postID": "post68444061", "replies": [{"text": "I've listet the eMail App as an negative point, so no superior things.

I can not say much about the software other than a big shoutout to all developers who helped getting CM rocking. \nAbout the Hardware: It feels better than any other phone out there. Very premium and the ceramic back seems impossible to break. They did a good job there. Unfortunately the phone is *very!* slippery, but I got used to that quickly. The biggest disappointment is the stability of the metal frame. I see my phone as a device to use and enjoy, so I wouldn't put a cover on it. I dropped it once or twice and I have a concrete floor at home, so it has very visible scratches (not on the ceramic or glass but on the metal frame!) and the metal frame even bended so much that the ceramic doesn't fit 100% anymore.\nObviously, performance and features are a dream and can be compared with an S7 (I have direct comparison). I am especially happy with the camera, which shoots gorgeous pics as long as there is enough light. Features implemented in software are not a thing for me, because I would use AOSP-based ROMs on every device.\nI previously had Aldi Talk as a carrier, but I managed to get a very cheap 6GB high speed data SIM from Telekom, so I now use Aldi Talk prepaid for calls and texts and Telekom for data. All the carriers in Germany use LTE band 20 for the rural areas, but Telekom has higher frequencies everywhere where I need it. \nAlso the GPS is very quick unlike Mi4's GPS.\n\nOverall I am happy that I could get such a premium and full-featured device for the money I had. Probably the S7 has some advantages, but they are so minor, that I would've bought the Mi5 even when I had more money to spend. The biggest doubt when buying my next Xiaomi phone will be the late release of the kernel sources.
