Swipe right to answer, left to reject. (THAT took a while to figure out!) But with my husband's phone, when I call it, it rings but the home page stays as is and there's nothing I can press to answer it. No phone symbol anywhere. Even when I click the green phone which is what you hit to make a call. It brings me to my contacts but still doesn't show any way to answer the phone.\nWe did get Geek Squad protection.
