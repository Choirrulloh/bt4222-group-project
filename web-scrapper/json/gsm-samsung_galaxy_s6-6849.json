And it takes 5 hrs to charge fully, that too if Mobile is OFF. If we ON the Mobile before charging reaches 40%, it drains very fast.\n \r\n4.Phone becoming heat, ALL which previously wasnt there.\n \r\nThe primary purpose of using a Mobile is to Receive or Dial a Call. If that was the only purpose, then we dont have to choose something like Samsung S6, instead there are MANY cheaper Mobiles, whose Battery last more than 3 days and whose datas are not stolen by any Google or Samsung or FB or Whatsapp or any other companies/ medias.\n \r\nWe use these kind of Mobiles for using Internet & for its speed mainly. But, now a days, if the Internet is ON, within 1-hr, the Mobile Battery drains and the Mobile is gone OFF.\n \r\nImagine: \r\n you want to use a Map to navigating to an unknown place and the Battery drains super fast and you end up in the half way \r\nOr even you want to watch a training video in Youtube & with in 1-hr, it is OFF  \r\nOr you had an important call conference or video chat & the Bloody Mobile is OFF on the half way and imagine the situation after going OFF and  \r\nNow, you wanted to Charge the mobile URGENTLY, as You expect some important calls like any verification or customer calls & the hell dont get charged! It takes half an hour to just charge INITIAL 5-10% only. If you ON the mobile during this 10%, it directly jumps to 3% and if u get into the Dialler pad re-jumps to 1%.

Only after satisfying these conditions, we pay our hard earned money to buy this product. \n \r\nA BRAND becomes a Brand when their Promisories are maintained till the end of its use.

Finally&#8252; (one of Samsung's biggest improvements) \r\n\t\u00c2\u0095 Camera quick launcher (Sony's physical shutter button is something the GT-i8000 had and I really miss it. The camera quick launcher of the S6 with Lollipop (TouchWiz NatureUX V5) actually worked much better than the one from Marshmallow (TouchWiz NatureUX6) (I will state more details about that later) \r\n\t\u00c2\u0095 Flashlight torch shortcut from quick toggle settings | despite that part of the user interface was messed up on NatureUX 5 and fixed with NatureUX 6, a flashlight shortcut was something iOS 7 had in it's new control center, which could be called by sliding up from the bottom of the screen. The flashlight could be altered even while the camera is running, while that was not possible on iOS. For the S6 (and S7 with Marshmallow pre-installed), the torch shortcut will be blocked while the camera is running. This makes it impossible to alter the flashlight for burst shots and DURlNG video recording. Actually, Sony's HOMANi camera user interface offers the torch setting during video recording. HTC also can do that. \n \r\nTake an example from the Sony HandyCam FDR-AX33p (or AXP33), where some camera settings can be adjusted during video recording. Some settings such as resolution, framerate and bitrate can not be altered during video recording. It would be good, if it could be adjusted during video recording, but apply automatically for the next time, and the ability to discard those changes before the video recording has ended. \r\nSince Android Marshmallow for Samsung phones (the HTC One M9 also had that for Lollipop, like Nokia 108 and Samsung Omnia i8000 too): the pause/record button could be pressed without any delay. You could press it as many times as you can press the iPhone's shutter key (only if exposure time is short enough) per second, and it would also react. \r\nThe Galaxy S7 also could preserve close to zero shutter lag. But as far as I know, to achieve that, the camera application needs to be excluded from all power saving procedures. The camera application should not be affected by power saving anyways, and only supported MultiWindow on the Note 4, where that glorious legacy mulWin tray was available, which had many advantages over the new system since S6. But since Android Marshmallow on S6, pressing the multi window icon on the recnet task switcher (fortunately no longer limited to 14/16 applications, but since Marshmellow affected by the rotation of the background app, which can actually be locked by tapping and holding the screen), does not cause that application to be added to the running application, but a completely new multi window session will be started. \r\nAdditionally, the Galaxy S7 will disable zero shutter lag, if the battery temperature thereshold (probably 25 degrees of celsius.).", "date": "15 Jan 2017"}, {"text": "camera failed with my s6 galaxy what can i do", "date": "15 Jan 2017"}, {"text": "Not true, there ARE fake Samsung devices with SAMSUNG branding.

On phones with removable battery, some important information is usually printed inside of the battery placeholder, which you can read by opening the back covver and remove the battery. On phones with a battery, which is not considered as user-replaceable (the battery of the S6 can actually be replaced, but one doing that risks losing the warrenty), it should be printed on the back cover. Due to some rule-changes, some manufacturers cease to do that (   ), just to achieve CLEANER designs, but nobody actually even notices those symbols. They could contain some information, that could be interesing. And the model number (S6: G920F) should also be printed there. And the boot screen, which has been uglified since the S5 with every new generation, shows that Android-Logo (\u00c2\u0084powered by Google Android technology\u00c2\u0093 or something similar) since S5 (I actually like that), but no longer the model number (G900F or G901F?

Is a rookie confused by those numbers? Just ignore them!\n \r\nI am glad, that many manufacturers still use dark boot screens. Every iPhone since iOS 7 (except iPhone 5c) uses a white background with a dark Apple as a boot screen. What's wrong with that? THe skeuomorphistic white Apple on a dark background looked more beautiful, glowed in the dark instead of looking like a creepy shadow, and if the left power in the battery is close to zero (but maybe 5 % reserve power to protect the battery itself), the white backgound could weaken the battery and cause the device to shut off instantly, like cutting off power. THis is, what usually happens with phones, that have a miscalibrated battery. Additionally, booting the phone in dark places with this white background hurts everybody's eyes as much as the camera shutter effect, which blacks out the camera viewfinder for the fraction of a seccond can be for epileptic people. Epilepsy is described on Wikipedia, if somebody does not know, what it is. There is not even a model number or a label (name of the phone, e.g. iPhone 6s) on that bootscreen.  \r\nRandom fact: I think, I once saw a phone by Sharp or Panasonic or maybe Acatel, where custom text could be added to it. But I do not know, which device it was.", "date": "03 Sep 2016"}, {"text": "Hello. TechLord/CaptainTech here.\n \r\nI just wanted to mention, how much I always hated, when the manufcturers mentioned \u00c2\u0084slim design\u00c2\u0093 as an advantage of the phone. I actually never noticed the design of the phone before the GT-i8000 was negatively rated on Chip.DE due to thickness and plastic. I initially thought, they might mention it due to the envoirnment damage caused by the production and trashing of plastic. But no, later I found out, that they mentioned it, because plastic is not considered as \u00c2\u0084premium\u00c2\u0093. So what is the practical advantage of that? How useful is a premium and thin design, if you are in killerJo's creepy dark night wood and your thin battery is running out? Not more than a dummy phone. Even the NoPhone is more useful then, due to it's robustity. The noPhone is even waterproof! And it's non-existant camera is placed in the conrer.\n \r\nThe practical part of design is robustity (LG V10 and some other rugged outdoor phones such as Carterpillers are very shock/bump/scratch/fire/temperature/etc.-resista\u00adnt.), comfortability (the premium-polycarbonate of the S5,Alpha,Note 3 and Note 4 felt comfortable), heat exhaustion (cooling down device: One M9 can be used to cook eggs), grip (not slide out of hand), wireless radio signals (metal might interfere with the signal strength of the wireless antenna),and waterproofity (Hyun Yeul Liar's \u00c2\u0084design with purpose\u00c2\u0093 on Unpacked2015 Episode 1 was a lie. The purpose on the S7 is stronger water-resistance. BUt not on the S6.) \r\nThe K-Zoom and S4-Zoom have a design, which counts as a feature. \r\nThe iPhone 4/4s's metal frame was a part of the antenna system. No bad idea, but touching it disturbed it. \r\nSome other practical design features are:  \r\n\t\u00c2\u0095 Physical Shutter Button (allows real camera shooting feeling, volume keys can be reserved for video recording, and applications such as games could use it.) \r\n\t\u00c2\u0095 Camera placed in the corner (allows penetrating into every corner, holding a better and more comfortable camera grip without covering the lens, and makes it very unlikely to accidentally touch the lens in everyday use in landscape (horizontal) usage. That camera corner is the \u00c2\u0084lonely corner\u00c2\u0093, which is isolated. THe purpose of a camera is not being a part of the design language (Samsung!), and no symmetry, but being practical. You do never have to worry about accidentally covering the lens when placing into the corner. Additionally, you can estimate the position of the camrea lens on the other side of the casing very accurately. On the S7 and Nokia Lumia 920, it is positioned in the cneter vertical axis. It is not nearly as easy to estimate, where exactly the position of the camera on the other side is. And if you want to shoot and record very unobtrusively, (e.g. capture the writing board at school, if you were unable to copy it to your excercise book), you only have to hold less than a fifth of the phone casing above the school table. When the camera is placed in the middle, you have to hold at least half the phone above the table to capture something. The camera really interferes with the usage. More information is mentioned here:   \u00c2\u0097 some old Samsung devices such as the S1-i9000 and especially the Omnia ll-GT-i8000 have designs, that are focussed more on practicallity. The i8000 has a horizontal Samsung logo, which looks more professional, and the position of the camera and the flash could be the camera and the Heart/UV(N4)/SpO\u00b2-Scanner with Samsung's new design language (since S6, but not Galaxy Alpha, where it is placed on the other side of the camera.)\n\n  \r\nContributes to slim design? Water-resistance is a reason. But slim design? Who had a problem with the 12mm-thick iPhone 2G? \r\nTake this:    \n \r\nIf I see advertisements, showing off the thin design as a feature, I know, that the manufacturer probably sacrificed features such as a practical hardware capability to achieve that. They should push the thin design to the last priority, because it might feel more premium, but a thicker phone sits better in the hand and gives me the proudness of not caring about slim design.

Super fast charging is awesome and with my newly bought powerbank- I even get my fast charge from the powerbank! \r\nThe preinstalled applications are cool. I use some of them and I find them cool. I use the 32GB version of the phone and so far I can't fill it all. I make the best picture quality and video, I have installed many applications and still the phone have a lot of space, plus you get OneDrive space for 2 years plus google space and you have a lot of cloud space. \r\nIf you want even more space for your phone, I suggest you install Flickr application. This is Yahoo application, connected to Flickr website, used from photographers from all over the world. You will get free 1TB !!! space and you can upload and upload and upload pictures with the best quality! \r\nThe sound is very clear during talk and loud enough so I can hear the person on loud places. \r\nThe screen is super bright! During day, even direct sunligh on my scree, I can see everything super clearly! This is just awesome! \r\nBoth cameras are cool and super quality. You get a lot of camera modes from the Samsung store application for free! They are pretty cool! \r\nThere is Ultra saving mode for the battery and believe me, the phone can and will last for days, maybe even a week! The good thing is that if you don't use your phone during night, the % of the battery do not drop. It just stays there. \r\nYou can dual screen and I found it pretty useful to check instagram and facebook at the same time or watch a video on youtube and browse the internet at the same time. \r\nAfter the update to Android 6.0.1 the phone seems stable. There are no problems and it is even better, when it comes to call people or they call you. \r\nThe new Andorid is not so different, but my phone use less RAM and I have much more free RAM now. \r\nOverall, the phone will surve you well. It is elegant and with light weight. \r\nIf you can get it- get it! You will like it! \r\nThere are more positive things to say, but I just can't remember what else. Oh, well.

S2 started to lag and hang and I even had to take off the battery few times a week if it hang. Then I change to iPhone 5s and I felt that it was like so muchhh better than samsung phones, despite saying the look which is much classy than samsung, I want to highlight on the functionsame etc, my iPhone 5s has never lag before (not exaggerating) camera was Hella good (front&back camera) AND TAKING PICTURES WITH IPHONE IS SO MUCH FASTER, I used 5s for about 2 years then I think it's time to make a change and the shape of Samsung s6 Edge kind of attracted me so yeah here now Im using the brand new Samsung s6 edge+. I have been using it for 3 months and I feel that.. this phone is really terrible. I took very good care of it (because its a Samsung phone) no overnight charging I even clear ram every few hours... now typing becoming leggy and slower, camera is the worst. It takes me few minutes to try to capture a short distance picture because focusing is too difficult in this phone, and the flash camera on near objects is very terrible too.

The hardware does feel premium, but so did my M8, so does the iPhone 6, so do a dozen other devices. Putting it against the iPhone 6 specifically, I personally like the much more rounded feel of that device than the sharper feeling edges of the S6. That's very likely better for grip in the end, but it loses a lot of its \"wow factor\" for me based on that alone. \n \r\nThe camera is very much praise worthy, however. I've been blown away by it's performance so far and can finally stop being an apologist in regards to virtually every other Android OEMs complacency here. We've been begging for a high quality camera for years and Samsung finally gave in and knocked it out of the park. Is it better than the iPhone 6 camera? Hard to say, but that's a good thing. How each camera deals with different things has become more a matter of personal preference than something obvious. \n \r\nDoes it look like an iPhone? Yes and no. Looking at it from an angle at a slight distance and you may end up taking a second look just to confirm which it is. Head on, the oblong home button and shiny \"Samsung\" logo shouldn't confuse anyone. I think any similarities are more reflective the general homology across all devices. We've sort of converged on a general device style that unfortunately leaves little room for real innovation. Sure, there are some basic aesthetic tweaks that can be applied and evolved, but we're far away from anything truly revolutionary.\n \r\nTouchWiz is interesting, but it's still just TouchWiz. It's the same ugly notification shade, it's the same collection of apps that for the most part don't really improve on it's stock AOSP or Play Store counterparts, and it's the same attempt at software differentiation as a brand strategy that I just can't imagine is working. I mean, I don't think people are buying Samsung phones for TouchWiz, but what do I know? That said, I don't exactly feel compelled to flash anything just yet (even if there were roms around). The device finally doesn't feel like its working against itself with regards to performance. Apps open when I want them to, the camera really does launch in under a second, and the stuttering that does happen feels more like it's a problem with the app than the phone. \n \r\nThe battery life is still up in the air for me.", "date": "21 Jan 2016"}, {"text": " ", "date": "21 Jan 2016"}, {"text": "Got mine yesterday. \n \r\nIt was between the S6 and the Nexux 5X(same price).

But then the truth hurts... and the truth is that the S6  may have killer specs but it has MEDIOCRE to BAD battery life.

You are using every trick on the book (4G/LTE data OFF most of the time; custom rom, low brightness, etc.) just so you can eke out more battery life.   You disagree and say you are not feeling 'limited' by the S6's battery life in any way and that you TRULY enjoy 15% screen brightness when playing games.  I have no problem with that... to each is own.\n \r\nThe reason why I originally made the post below is to help others (apparently, not all) in their purchasing decisions especially since the smartphone is increasingly being used  to watch online videos, listen to music, play games, breaking news and social media updates, etc. (in addition to calls and text) which means a big 1080p screen, a  powerful 4000 mAh battery, a very good processor/GPU combo (SD 652, Adreno 510), and all the SD card space (128GB) when you need it, at HALF the price of flagship phones spells the difference between wall hugging, squinting, and buyer's remorse, to truly living and enjoying all that a smartphone has to offer in the smartphone era. \r\n---------- Original Post -------- \r\nThe Samsung Galaxy A9 is a vastly better device than this one. \r\n1. Display - 1440x2560 (2.5k) is overkill unless you are into the dizzying VR hobby. 1080p is enough for this display. And no, you won't see better resolution with this display compared to a 1080p display. It only wastes battery and lowers device performance. \r\n2. 4000mAh should be the minimum battery standard nowadays. What's the point of a gorgeous display that is dead by lunch time if you use it fairly frequently to watch videos  \r\nor play games or stream music? \r\n3. Dual sim should be the standard nowadays. One SIM for cheaper data package and another SIM for cheaper phone calls and text package --- or one sim for home and another for work or for local and international travel to save on roaming data. There are plenty other uses for two SIMs and the latest Android versions support them, so why limit one's flexibility? \r\n4. Why no SD card support? SD card support is very useful for people who love to have the entire music collection, HD movie collection and photo collection in their PC's, available anytime, anywhere in their phones even without data connection. They can mirror or screencast (wifi-direct) the movies and photos to any TV anywhere they go, no internet connection needed! Besides, smartphones nowadays offer ever increasing camera resolutions (16 MP+) and ever increasing video resolutions (4K) which will devour a standard 32 GB internal storage in no time. \r\n-----------------------\n", "date": "20 Jan 2016"}, {"text": "Put a dark theme instead of a light one first.

Before the S6, I owned iPhones (3-5), which were fine products, but my wife purchased a Galaxy S5 and I really liked its performance and the ability to remove and replace the battery and memory to it.  I really had hoped that when I upgraded from iPhone 5 to a Galaxy S6 with my provider that it would be an improved product.  Well, that has not been the case.  The battery life is terrible.  I have uninstalled and disabled virtually everything I can (including the bloatware from the provider), outside of the bare minimum, factory reset the phone three times, burned through two S6s (after my first had this problem, to which my provider pretended never to have heard of this issue at all and gave me a new S6), and the battery drainage is never ending (I turn off all notifications and background data usage).  It just keeps draining.  Of course, come to find out, the fine people at Samsung decided to give us a smaller battery on the S6.  It shows.  That makes this a non-recommended product just for that.  I have to keep this phone on a charger at almost all times.  I have gone from 100% down to 10% back up to 100%, and then back down to 10% in a single day (depending on my access to a charger at work).  There is no excuse for this.  The battery alone makes it an inferior product.\n \r\nSecond, before the S6, what made Galaxy products so interesting, to me, was the fact they had (unlike iPhones) removable battery and SD memory card capabilities.  The S6 does not have those.  So, you receive a smaller, overheated, dying battery, which you need to constantly charge, but not way to replace it.  To say this is a trap would be putting it kindly.  Like a fool, when I bought this product, I assumed it would have the removable battery and SD card slot, like my wife's S5 (and every previous Galaxy product).  I cannot understate what a disappointment this is to me (next to its terrible battery life).  If you have a Galaxy S5, do yourself a favor and keep it.\n \r\nThe only attribute this phone has going for it, and it is its one nice feature, is the camera.  It is 16 megapixels, and it takes wonderful pictures.  So, if you like having a really good camera with no battery life, no memory or battery removal capabilities, have to minimize virtually all of your internet activities so they don't drain what little of your disappearing battery life you have left, and is just a worse version of the iPhone, well, the Galaxy S6 is for you.\n \r\nIn short, I will never purchase another Samsung phone ever again after this.  It is a fraud.  I have seriously considered just paying the remaining cost on the phone, blowing it up (so my provider does not recycle it and rip off another unsuspecting customer), deserting my provider altogether, and dishing out the money for a Nexus 5, but I will have to wait another year before that.

It looks good and everything but it's just too common. Also, the back is a fingerprint magnet (visible even on my white device) and the frame tends to warm up (not scorching hot!!) when used intensively and could be a bit uncomfortable. Very slightly raised corners helps a great deal with handling too. \r\n7/10\n \r\n==&#12299; General Performance: \r\nThe device is quite snappy and has a lot of raw power, however don't think you won't run into a couple of hiccups every once in a while. While they might be small, they are still noticeable. Also, watch out for RAM usage, Touchwiz uses a lot and autostarting applications can bog it down even more. \r\n6/10\n \r\n==&#12299; Screen and Audio: \r\nScreen is just so superb. It's supremely sharp and combining that with infinite contrast and maximum brightness, it remains perfectly legible even in the brightest of conditions. Viewing angels and colour rendition also strike home runs. Overall, it's the best screen I've seen on any device yet. \r\nAudio is not the loudest, but good enough. The output quality is amazing though, and 24-bit FLAC support is also appreciated. \r\n9.5/10\n \r\n==&#12299; Battery: \r\nAll I'm going to say is that it's good enough. But I've seen better. \r\n6/10\n \r\n==&#12299; Camera: \r\nSuperb sharpness, excellent dynamic range, great contrast and colour rendition. However, no native RAW support (third party applications needed, best result \"Camera FV-5\") and no manual shutter (max 0.5 seconds time limit using third party applications).  \r\n9.5/10\n \r\nOverall: 8/10\n \r\nThis must be noted that all this subjective to personal opinion, I myself is a power hungry user and while I'm writing this, my phone is at 14% and I've been using it with WiFi on for the last 6 hours, with on screen time 3.5 hours.

I can't change the dialer screen from that stupid ugly colour \"green\" to anything else. this specially confusing because when you dial a number it stays green, when someone answers the phone it will continue to stays green!, the previous Galaxy where only turning green when someone were answered the phone, so I find this stupid to be honest and can't believe Samsung allow that to happen.\n \r\n2. If I make a phone call and the phone number engage there is NO OPTION to activate the re-dial!! again very stupid miss by Samsung, because even my Galaxy S2, S3 had that; before I change to this phone! how could they not include such a important feature! the \"auto redial\" is the must and Samsung miss that!! how!!????\n \r\n3. this is minor complain, but the default alarm is rubbish! why? because it doesn't allow you to change the snooze time from every 5 min to something else! I know you can download loads of other apps to over come this problem but I quite liked the default alarm on my S2, .\n \r\n4. The samsung theme market to change the screen/theme are so ugly and the green dialer screen ALWAYS stays that colour no matter what theme you download, and so limited options there, please bring back the old look of dialer screen and get rid of this stupid green and white colour scheme !\n \r\nany comments are much appreciated, I hope I hear a good discussion regarding the about 4 topics\n \r\nanyone else share the same view?

Ya it has some issues like over heating and battery problem but here is the solution-\n \r\nSince it has a qhd display and also the  brightest display in the market so you can use it with half of it's brightness which is still brighter than most of the phones. It last full day with normal use and for full day gaming it needs to charge twice a day. \n \r\nI don't have any other problems with this device. I played HD games like- thor, asphalt airborne, modern combat 5 and many more without any lag.  \r\nHere is my comparison to other phones- I never take my phone to shower if you know what I mean, none of my phone has ever  encountered water splash. This is the most vivid and brightest display in the market. I love bigger display phone but this one feels good in hand. I got the platinum gold version which looks awesome,  I love android because of its new games but iPhone also good for some features so it depends on your personal preferences.

This can be a quick simple tip for those who are quick to judge at these tech gadgets. 1. When you buy a new smartphone, always buy it couple months after release. This goes for any phone. Sometimes, when you buy a new smartphone, there is a high chance that the phone can have a lot of problems. *The tests the company runs before release isn't always perfect*. Within the several months wait, the company finds issues and sends out updates for bug fixes and defects and all other problems. I bought my Galaxy S6 end of July, and have been using it since. It's always good to research the phone you want before you purchase, so you don't look stupid when you get the phone. and when i say research, I'm not just talking about looking at specs, but other things as well, such as good tips and tricks and apps that can make you look like iron man with your phone. Sure, some of the negatives of the  phone can get annoying, but there are solutions to those, and after a while of getting used too, it can be an effective phone. To those that are worried about battery life, you can either charge it to full, wait for it to be aroun 1 % and recharge it, or you can either by an portable battery charger so you can charge it on the go or when an s6 battery case comes out, you can purchase that.

If you are an Android person, I recommend this phone. I like the finger print ID-up to 4. If you are anal and need the instant messages, then maybe the S6 Edge is for you.  Anywho, check out the reviews and decide for yourself.  Just remember that Apple and Android are different operating systems with but with a lot of the same apps.

I love this phone!! For one the design feels good in your hand! Feels fragile and delicate so DONT DROP this beautiful phone!! It runs incredibly smooth like iOS smooth but feels more fluid. The Camera takes amazing pictures. I did notice that video playback was a tad bit, laggy, sometimes, not a big deal though, the Blackberry Z30 and iPhone play YouTube, movies, and video very smooth. Google Play Music. Music you buy from GP can be downloaded and played here. For some reason no music Equalizer is installed on Google Play Music for the LG G4, or the HTC One M9, but on the GS6, an equalizer comes installed for Google Play Music and music sounds awesome! It sounds really good, just as good as the LG G4 pre-installed Music Player EQ, iPhone EQ, and Blackberry EQ. The apps run very smooth. Compared to the G4 and HTC One, the GS6 feels smoother somehow but each one has a different feel from one another. Trust me just because they are droids, they each feel like their own identity. iPhone and Blackberry and the droids are different from one another each has an advantage over the other thats why it is hard to compare to one another. You cannot go wrong with GS6, HTC, or G4. All of these phones are near perfect. Also battery life.. iPhone and Blackberry have the better battery life.

Samsung has forgotten that many of their smartphone customers chose Samsung over the iPhone because they prefer the convenience and practicality of having user-replaceable batteries. Having a phone with a user-replaceable battery means that you will not be forced to leave your phone (for many weeks to even more than a month!) to a technician or service center just to have the battery replaced. With a user-replaceable battery, you just buy a new battery and thereby avoid being terribly inconvenienced (to say the least)of leaving your phone to a service center and not being able to use it for many weeks! Plus your privacy is compromised because the service center technician can view your files, photos, text messages, etc. And with a user-replaceable battery, you can just carry an extra battery along with you, so that when your phone's battery get drained you just replace it with your extra fully-charged spare battery. Changing the battery takes only a couple of minutes. Saves you the trouble of carrying a bulkier/heavier powerbank, because a spare battery is much smaller/slimmer and lighter in weight than a powerbank. Plus you don't have to suffer the inconvenience and difficulty of having a powerbank attached to your phone while you are on the move. So Samsung... wake up! Bring back the design of having phones with user-replaceable batteries, or you will surely be losing many customers who really want phones with user-replaceable batteries. Many Galaxy S5, S4, S3 users have already said that they will not buy the S6 nor the S6 Edge... and instead buy another phone brand that offers a user-replaceable battery design.

These cheap one usually have good spec on camera and display but never impress on the chipset or CPU with low ram and low internal memory. Some cheap phone would go with high spec chipset and cpu performance but fails on display and camera. Price is made genuinely based on the real cost and allocated profit.

You can read a fuller explanation I made some time ago  which I repasted.", "date": "17 Apr 2015"}, {"text": "@1701, @aod. It is really ridiculous  to think apple copied Samsung Ativs  2012 design. Pioneering is about inventing a new idea or re-inventing an old , bad, unprofitable or bankrupt idea. Apple is very good in invention and re- invention. Apple has brought a lot of pioneering features to the mobile industry, recently are the voice command (Siri), 64 bit mobile operating system, finger print touch ID, Apple pay (mobile payment) , a very simply and user friendly interface and operating system. All of which Samsung and other major phones have followed in doing too. I know a lot of people will want to disagree on apples pioneering role in all the things above but you have to realize that if not for Apple most of the ideas above were not in existence or have been tried but failed by other companies in the past until Apple re- invented those ideas. Let's take the NFC, practically all major phones except Apple had it since 2yrs now but did nothing useful with it until Apple came up with the payment system and now Samsung has followed with their own Samsung pay pal , some people will now want to say but Samsung put in NFC first , the issue is what did they do with it before the Apple pay. Another feature is the finger print which was a bankrupt abandoned idea by Motorola and no other company was going in that direction until Apple re-invented the idea and turned it into millions of dollars and the result is most companies have followed it. Let now come back to the design issue. The ist iPhone is just a smaller version of the iPhone 6 in terms of the structural design , as in the rounded  edges. So it's ridiculous to say Apple copied Samsung Ativs 2012 design when it was used in the first iPhone back in 2007.  But let us even assume Apple copied the Samsung Ativs 2012 design, don't you wonder why Samsung had to wait for Apple to use that same design before they used it again in their premium phone. It was a design that was not continued after 2012 meaning it was a poor design to Samsung and was never included in any of their premium phones not until Apple turned that same design by your own assertion into millions of dollars in iPhone 6 and all of a sudden Samsung just realized its 3yr old abandoned design is a winner. I don't have a problem with phones copying one or two features from another. Apple borrowed the antenna lines from HTC M8, but if you place both the iPhone 6 and HTC M8 side by side you won't think they are same bcos they are different in their overall design. So I don't have a problem with Samsung copying Apple, but the problem which I have with the GS6 and which a lot of people and reviewers have with it is that it looks exactly like the iPhone 6, as in an exact copy of iPhone 6 save for the shape of the finger print scanner. Is it a coincidence that Samsung had to wait for Apple to introduce the rounded edges , antenna lines , one touch finger print (as opposed to Samsungs swipe in GS5 and note 4) in the same phone before they do it too. Have you even looked at the base of the GS6, the position of the headphone jack, the charging or docking port and the speakers, they are exactly where Apple put them in the iPhone 6. And now again the introduction of the non removable battery and absence of micro sd slot. Samsung couldn't even hide their 'Copy Cat' this time around. By your assertion Apple may have copied some features from other phones but you can not confuse them with one another unlike the iPhone 6 and GS6 similarity. You will see when Apple decides  to make an iPhone with a curved display what they will do with it instead of Samsung just putting it and doing nothing in particular with that curved display, I predict by then Samsung may have abandoned the curved display. I still maintain my assertion that the GS6 is just an iPhone 6 with a Samsung logo on it with better specifications which might not mean better performance on the long run. I still maintain my assertion too that it's a very very good phone in design and specifications and will definitely give the iPhone 6 a run for the crown. As an iPhone owner , can I buy the GS6 , the answer is NO. There is just this  smoothness and simplicity yet very powerful feel you get with Apple products which is addictive, and also the smooth integration amongst their product that makes you tied down with them.

What about the Touch ID  AFTER USING SWIPE IN S5 and Note 4. I know it's dificult for you to imagine but to alot of us it's pretty glaring. Samsung targeted iPhone users this time around at the expense of their loyal customers. With respect to the 2k display , it's a trade off owners of this phone will have to deal with , the screen of any phone is the single most important consumer of battery. No matter how efficient you make the chip that screen will consume it's fair share of  energy. Samsung has followed apple in doing a lot of things, but one thing they have not learnt from apple is that more doesn't always mean better. They will soon realize that. Are you telling me that come next year they will increase the display to 4k  in S7 then again increase to maybe 8k in S8 etc. more doesn't  always mean better.

Pioneering is about inventing a new idea or re-inventing an old , bad, unprofitable or bankrupt idea. Apple is very good in invention and re- invention. Apple has brought a lot of pioneering features to the mobile industry, recently are the voice command (Siri), 64 bit mobile operating system, finger print touch ID, Apple pay (mobile payment) , a very simply and user friendly interface and operating system. All of which Samsung and other major phones have followed in doing too. I know a lot of people will want to disagree on apples pioneering role in all the things above but you have to realize that if not for Apple most of the ideas above were not in existence or have been tried but failed by other companies in the past until Apple re- invented those ideas. Let's take the NFC, practically all major phones except Apple had it since 2yrs now but did nothing useful with it until Apple came up with the payment system and now Samsung has followed with their own Samsung pay pal , some people will now want to say but Samsung put in NFC first , the issue is what did they do with it before the Apple pay. Another feature is the finger print which was a bankrupt abandoned idea by Motorola and no other company was going in that direction until Apple re-invented the idea and turned it into millions of dollars and the result is most companies have followed it. Let now come back to the design issue. The ist iPhone is just a smaller version of the iPhone 6 in terms of the structural design , as in the rounded  edges. So it's ridiculous to say Apple copied Samsung Ativs 2012 design when it was used in the first iPhone back in 2007.  But let us even assume Apple copied the Samsung Ativs 2012 design, don't you wonder why Samsung had to wait for Apple to use that same design before they used it again in their premium phone. It was a design that was not continued after 2012 meaning it was a poor design to Samsung and was never included in any of their premium phones not until Apple turned that same design by your own assertion into millions of dollars in iPhone 6 and all of a sudden Samsung just realized its 3yr old abandoned design is a winner. I don't have a problem with phones copying one or two features from another. Apple borrowed the antenna lines from HTC M8, but if you place both the iPhone 6 and HTC M8 side by side you won't think they are same bcos they are different in their overall design. So I don't have a problem with Samsung copying Apple, but the problem which I have with the GS6 and which a lot of people and reviewers have with it is that it looks exactly like the iPhone 6, as in an exact copy of iPhone 6 save for the shape of the finger print scanner. Is it a coincidence that Samsung had to wait for Apple to introduce the rounded edges , antenna lines , one touch finger print (as opposed to Samsungs swipe in GS5 and note 4) in the same phone before they do it too. Have you even looked at the base of the GS6, the position of the headphone jack, the charging or docking port and the speakers, they are exactly where Apple put them in the iPhone 6. And now again the introduction of the non removable battery and absence of micro sd slot. Samsung couldn't even hide their 'Copy Cat' this time around. By your assertion Apple may have copied some features from other phones but you can not confuse them with one another unlike the iPhone 6 and GS6 similarity. You will see when Apple decides  to make an iPhone with a curved display what they will do with it instead of Samsung just putting it and doing nothing in particular with that curved display, I predict by then Samsung may have abandoned the curved display. I still maintain my assertion that the GS6 is just an iPhone 6 with a Samsung logo on it with better specifications which might not mean better performance on the long run. I still maintain my assertion too that it's a very very good phone in design and specifications and will definitely give the iPhone 6 a run for the crown. As an iPhone owner , can I buy the GS6 , the answer is NO. There is just this  smoothness and simplicity yet very powerful feel you get with Apple products which is addictive, and also the smooth integration amongst their product that makes you tired down with them.

Same Look Makes People Unhappy\n \r\nGalaxy S6 smartphone is not up to the mark and its design is same with a little brush up changes in the color contrast. So ultimately, its earlier edition of Galaxy S5 has the same look with little variance in design. So customers are not interested to lay their hands on this latest handset in spite of glossy appearance.\n \r\n2. S6 with Low Energy Efficiency\n \r\nWhether Galaxy S6 smart phone is cost effective and energy efficient depends on the battery life. There are many negative points to mention. However, the severe drawback is its less powerful battery compared to Galaxy S5 model.\n \r\n3. Galaxy S6 \u0096Not Up to the Mark\n \r\nWhen this Galaxy S6 handset was designed and then reset at the company\u0092s workstation, people came to know about the exact shape of this handset in advance. So, before being launched to the market, customers got information about the look, color contrast and design of this smart phone. So charm has been spoiled to have a look at this handset on the internet. It reduces the popularity of this smart phone to some extent.\n \r\n4. Low Color Pixels/Resolution \u0096 A Drawback\n \r\nCritics have highlighted low color resolution which is not modified. 2560 x 1440 pixel QHD resolution is not upgraded. So customers are not pleased to use this handset. However, picture displaying is better with a higher data storage space. Smartly speaking, youngsters want more gorgeous pictures to display. 557 Pixels every inch on the touch screen are not sufficient to produce the natural effect on the visual presentation of digital snapshots.\n \r\n5. Low Energy Efficiency Level\n \r\nCustomers who are economical search for powerful smart phones with higher energy efficiency level. They don\u0092t want to spend money to replace batteries frequently. They want faster service without spending huge amount of energy/fuel. Truly speaking, this new edition is not capable of providing longer backup during emergency. That means, the battery life expectancy is not satisfactory.  The available strength of the micro battery is 2550mAh only. At first, customers expected that there would be good news about the replacement of the old batteries. However, at least they didn\u0092t get expected result as this smart phone has lack of strength to save the energy of the battery.\n \r\nIt is the major drawback. However, in a news release, the management of the company has claimed that it is not a severe breakdown. With the help of powerful recharger, one can power the battery soon within the span of 10 minutes. Consumers are confused whether they will have to wait for another superb handset in the upcoming monsoon. The stereotyped look has discouraged young sweethearts who are desirous of getting some innovative cell phones with wonderful decoration.  They don\u0092t negotiate with the style and color contrast of the smart phones. Perhaps Galaxy S6 will not energize them to go to the departmental stores to buy this handset on the spot.\n \r\n6. No Micro SD Card Slot Available in Galaxy S6\n \r\nSmall but visible defects have also been surfaced by experienced mobile users. According to them, Micro SD card slots are unavailable in this handset. So it is a minus point to let customers to have a faster switchover to opt for the best handset. It is a prominent reason of the reduction of energy level of people to purchase Galaxy S6 model. The dashing and dynamic look of Galaxy S5 is still impressive to lure next generation. They don\u0092t want to compromise when they shop online to have sophisticated flip top smart phones at the reasonable prices.\n \r\nSo, you need to decide faster whether you are comfortable to handle this smart phone. Well, many believe that this Galaxy S6 is not water resistant. My Goodness! It is a fault on the part of the company. This handset will be damaged when it is drenched in water droplets. The interior decoration will be smashed and discolored.  So hurry up to have a new smart phone which is water proof with good resilience.

However, you said you backup photos to USB, so you must be packing around a laptop or something. You can still do that with the S6. Sounds like the only reason you starting using the memory card for files was because your microUSB port broke on your S2. Even if Andrdoid somehow broke on your new S6 and it wouldn't boot up, or perhaps you broke the screen and it doesn't recognize touches, your photos would still be on the data partition that won't get wiped when you factory reset your S6. If your pics are really that important to where you're THAT paranoid, maybe you should be using a D-SLR. Plus, backing them up or simply storing them directly on microSD card is not that good of an idea since microSD is fairly unreliable and you could lose all the data on it, not to mention it's slow and someone could steal it out of your phone and get your pics if you don't encrypt it. It would be a lot more likely to lose data from a microSD than from the /sdcard/ partition on internal storage.\n \r\nI've said it before and I'll say it again: We have tons of phones with sealed batteries. Phone makers include a way to hard-reset phones without removing the battery. Even phones with removable batteries can be hard reset without removing the battery, usually by holding power for 5 or 8 seconds, sometimes in combination with volume-down or up. The fact that so many people pull their battery when their phone acts up is astounding to me. Maybe it's a behavior left-over from Blackberry users, but it's an out-dated belief, that's for sure.\n \r\nNot trying to talk you into getting an S6, but I think people aren't really thinking about alternatives to having microSD + removable battery. They would rather whine about it which does zero good. Like Samsung gives a rip. The only thing that will make them listen is sales figures. If the S6 flops, they might consider adding microSD if possible with UFS 2.0 (still unsure if it's technically possible, but I'm pretty sure it is).\n \r\nI wonder how hard the S6 is to take apart enough to replace the battery. I'm guessing pretty hard but maybe not. We need a tear-down of the S6, haha. Samsung will surely make a lot of money on replacing peoples' batteries in their S6 just like Apple does.

Samsung brought in over $27 billion in profit last year, but recently it has struggled as its Galaxy devices have come under pressure from Apple\u0092s iPhone and cheaper Chinese device-makers. CEO Oh-Hyun Kwon hopes to continue the record-high revenues by expanding Samsung\u0092s medical and health, business-to-business and smart home units.\"\n \r\n\"Apple, the maker of the globally popular iPhone and iPad devices, posted sales of almost $171 billion in 2013, 9% higher than the prior year. But the company has come under pressure in the competitive smartphone business, and its profit shrank 11% to $37 billion from 2012 to 2013. Even so, Apple has a huge amount of cash on hand, and CEO Tim Cook recently deployed some of that cash pile by announcing $30 billion in stock buybacks.\"\n \r\nSo for your concern about financial performance of Samsung sales linked with there smartphones, you should see that it's not as bad as Apple. But you didn't mentioned Apple sales performances, because then you would have no more points to defend.\n \r\nFor the possibility of bankruptcy by Samsung that you fear, I will assure you that it won't happen in this decade, at least. Just to explain my point: Samsung net profit in 2013 report was $20.6 billion (while Apple register $41.7 billion) and over $27.2 billion (while Apple profit went down 11.3% at $37 billion) for 2014 report. 2015 will be release soon.\n \r\nSo not only I wouldn't be scared for Samsung if I was you, but I wouldn't worry for Apple as well, as both are registering huge profits year after year and they both have very highly skilled Head executives. \n \r\nIf you're really neutral as I am, you will notice that both companies got their respective sales stressed by the emerging smartphone companies that get in the race lately.\n \r\nThose companies are emerging as they sell good looking smartphones that most of the time are just low quality copy or strangely similar to the main smartphones that lead the market. Those companies are aiming at first to the peoples from emerging countries as well as for the poor peoples from developed countries. They only way it can become a more serious factor, is to see in the next few years, how many of them will pass from the low end smartphones market, to the mid an/or high end market. \n \r\nSources: \n \r\n1.  \n \r\n2.

I was glad to see built in oxygen sensor in Note 4, that is not much talked about yet, but practically speaking dual speakers will be a much more welcome feature than oxygen sensor! As S6 is not finalized yet, I hope to see all the specs listed here AND dual speakers -hopefully with excellent reproduction of sound.
