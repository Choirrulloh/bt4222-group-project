Here is how I setup my Droid to read texts out loud, and dictate texts and emails as well while driving.\n1. Disable Moto voice. I have used this program on 2 different droids and it does not work well all the time. It's sporadic, I think it has to do with your network connection.\n2. Install Dragon Mobile, once installed go to settings and under \"in the car\" turn \"automatically start driver mode\" to on. This app will read out your incoming texts. During the read out it will let you respond through it too. You don't want this program set to listen, just make the changes I mention before. Do not have anything set to on under \"General\". Under \"My Assistant\" you can select a voice and give them your own wake up phrase. Do not set any other options under \"My assistant\", they should all be off.\n3. Setup Ok Google. This can be found under Settings\" and \"Language and Input\". Under \"Ok Google\" Detection make sure \"From the Google app\" and \"From any screen\" are turned on. Under \"Hands Free\" select \"for Bluetooth devices\". Also under the main \"Language & Inputs\" settings allow \"Bluetooth headset\".\nThis setup allows me to initiate, texts and emails, as well as control the phone with OK Google. This is more efficient than moto voice since some commands require moto voice to trigger google search anyway. Ok google seems to work way better than moto voice too, far more consistent. When a text comes in however, Dragon Mobile will notify and display the text as well as read it out, gives option to reply and send immediately. \nI have tried many setups and this one work best.", "time": "02-04-2016 09:26 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4983406", "text": "I use the app Agent.

Most noticeably, it barely drains in standby, typically wakes up within 1-2% of where it went to sleep an hour or more later. New battery was the only change made, no factory reset or other software configuration changes.\nI've observed two buckets of DT2 owners here on this forum: Those reporting 24+ hours standby/ 5+ hrs of screen time, and the rest of us suffering <12hr standby and <3hr screen time despite our best conservation efforts (low screen brightness, etc.). On neither of my DT2s (2015 original, 2017 warranty replacement), I never saw battery performance at anywhere near level, even when brand new.\nBefore battery replacement, I was barely getting 7-8 hours on this seven month old DT2 (Moto warranty replacement in Feb), before it would spontaneously shut down at as high as 30-40% battery. After trying factory reset, battery meter recalibration, and clearing cache partition, I concluded the battery was damaged, perhaps caused by a few incidents of severe overheating (111+ degrees) earlier this year, and decided to try replacement. \nI haven't had enough days yet using this in my typical daily pattern to measure new/better screen time, but I know for certain it's a lot higher than my previous 2.5-3 hrs.\nFWIW, here are my current speculations about DT2 battery life:\n1) Some original OEM DT2 batteries are better than others, perhaps by a lot. I wonder if this falls along Moto Maker vs. stock handsets. (Mine is Moto Maker design.)\n2) DT2 system software is poorly optimized for low cell signal conditions, and possibly Bluetooth as well (I'm a Pebble watch and frequent BT headset user, so BT is connected nearly full time). Possibly exacerbated by Nougat or other system update this past spring.\n3) Verizon Voicemail app and perhaps their other bloatware can cause battery damaging over-heating. I diagnosed and reported this earlier this year on this forum, remedied by disabling them.\nIf you want to try battery replacement, Google \"phone repair shops\" and call around, I found a wide range of availability and prices ($70-110).

I bought it from the Verizon store. Fortunately for me, I haven't had any quality control issues. Not sure if I would purchase another Moto phone. I do like the Moto actions but other than that there is nothing special about this phone that one can't equal/surpass in another phone.", "time": "04-27-2016 08:58 AM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"postID": "post5147905", "text": "Okay guys, I have a quick update.

Either you're in a poor coverage area or your device is bogged down or possibly both. When I say bogged down it could be bogged down with a high demand for data or by a high demand for memory. With the former it can seem like you are in a low coverage area, so if you're sure you're in a good coverage area or you're on WiFi let's start there. Open your settings and go to data. Look there at what is using data, and what is using the most data. If nothing seems out of place there good, but if you notice some app that you barely open or use in the highest percentage of use you may want to limit its background usage. This will essentially cause it to access most of its background data over WiFi and as long as you don't notice any abnormal issues from this it would probably be safe to just leave it in this state. It will access data normally if you open the app or are using it so no fear that you're cutting it off. Anyway memory usage can create a laggy response in an app and it's not always the use in the app that is laggy causing the lag. You can go about this on your own but there are a lot of small apps that will clear your caches and free up memory. CCleaner is one, but whatever app you get avoid automated apps for this. They drain battery power, usually result in a few more issues than they solve, and it's not something that has to be done constantly, usually. You should be able to go in and clear your cache and get rid of junk files once a week or so to keep your device running smoothly, daily is too much, but you may find that it can be monthly and be enough. The other thing when it comes to memory that will bog you down is SMS. If you have thousands of messages, and hundreds of MMS you will notice a lag after some time. Keep a tidy in box and you may find that many of your issues will go away in all of your apps. If you're keeping things because you can't bare to let go, find a backup app and keep only those things you must have and let the rest go.", "time": "08-15-2016 07:24 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5328117", "text": "I understand that when I'm out & about Twitter maybe slow to load due to coverage etc but it's even slow on WiFi.

For example SMS overload. Your SMS app wants to have the maximum number of texts at your beckon call and because it's looking for texts all the time the conflict exists where it may compete for resources with other apps. The simple thing here tho, and most don't get it, is to simply power down the device one in awhile. Powering down prompts many apps to dump their own caches and clean up their own mess. However with people feeling the need to stay connected 24/7 this simple but effective tool goes unused. I can't tell you how many times I've seen people say the only time they power down is when the device dies on them. Which if you're wondering is not good, I man allowing the device to power off due to lack of charge. Anyway regularly restarting your device is a healthy practice, at least something like every 4 or 5 days helps. Then any time you're carrying thousands of messages, messaging apps just weren't designed to do that, they can get a little screwy. Facebook is another resource hog and if not properly managed can tap your resources. It's gotten better over the years but there was a time when it would all but shutdown your device.

They're fast, smooth, have very good battery life (really not looking for a debate on this one - we all average 5 to 6 hours screen-on-time, and about 36 hours before needing a charge - putting it on a wireless charger before bed each night means we never run out of juice). The very light layer of Moto features on top of Android add real utility. Sound and connectivity are great too.\nRe: unbreakable screen: this really is a great feature - my wife and daughter would both have had to exercise our insurance plans to replace their phones or screens by now without it, as they've both dropped their DT2's a couple of times. What I think Motorola should have thought through a bit better is the fact that the top removable layer of plastic is still scratchable. It won't break, but if it scratches - which it does far more easily than glass - you'll be stuck with a nasty looking screen until you spring for a new $25 replacement; not a bad price, but with a screen that scratches easily, you may wind up doing this many times.\nWith this in mind, I added a 0.2mm tempered glass protector (Verizon branded - installed by them at the store for $25 - highly recommended, btw) to each of the 3 phones. Even though the protector is glass, being attached to and \"floating\" centered on the plastic beneath, it's actually pretty resistant to fractures. My daughter and have have both dropped their DT2's and there are no cracks. My daughter's DT2 is \"naked\" - no case on it at all. My wife has a simple TPU case on hers (CaseMate Tough on mine).\nMy reasoning: the tempered glass layer looks and feels great: none of the three phones are showing any scratches at all despite 5 months of heavy use. If you do drop the phone so the glass protector cracks, it's $25 to replace it. But - I think that there will be far less frequent need to replace a glass protective layer than there would be to replace the top plastic Moto \"shatter shield\" layer. Our phones all look and feel 100% new, and I know that I can keep them like this over the next couple of years, and I will never have to worry about the screen breaking on any of them. THAT is a big plus for me.\nI think the shatter proof screen is a wonderful idea - finding a way to market it so that people can have the same experience that my family is having now, with the glass protector on top, would be a bit of a challenge, but can be done - and could be very powerful. The idea that you can have the look and feel of a top of the line premium screen, but repair the worst damage it might incur for $25, is really compelling.

(Standard for any phone, pretty much.)\nIf you have a Downloads shortcut on one of your screens, it'll disappear and have to be re-added. I am sure other apps may do the same -- provided they still exist. And FYI: Downloads is appearing as icons, but there is a quick easy-to-find button in the upper right that you can click on to flip from icons to list and vice versa.\nOn that note, the messaging app from Marshmallow is gone. Without setting up Messenger for texts (which is SMS Messages), I had my girlfriend send me a text message. It defaulted it to Facebook Messenger and was a freaking mess. There was no other choice but to set up the SMS Messenger app so I could separate SMS Messages from the Facebook Messenger app. (And both are labeled \"Messenger\" in your apps drawer. Nice! Least they have different icons and you know they're different.)\nAnd then I had to go into Facebook Messenger options and turn off SMS messages so 1) Facebook Messenger wouldn't be the default app for SMS, and 2) turn off SMS messages completely so they would be out of the list and leave Facebook Messenger as just that: Messages from Facebook contacts. Facebook Messenger was NEVER set up for this before, but because post-update I did nothing else initially, they had to go somewhere. I can only imagine if Facebook Messenger wasn't installed what would have happened.\nThis new SMS messenger app is also bad in the sense that it auto-assigns colors to different people, which is a direct match to the randomly assigned colored background if you view them in your Contacts app. The old one I had it set as blue for my messages and the other person was the default white or whatever and I liked it. Now they're the colored message and I'm the default white.\nIn the main list of messages of the SMS messenger app, if you don't have a picture of them in contacts, you will see the white letter in a circle of the auto-assigned color. And when you open it up, all messages are in that color unless you go and change it in the thread's options. If you have a picture for the contact already, you'll see the picture in the main list, but again, whatever color is in the background if you edit the contact in Contacts? That's the color you see in the thread. And there is also no options in Contacts or SMS Messenger to set a mass default for everyone's color to be the same, at least not that I have found.\nBasically, I don't want a kaleidoscope. I want simple, same freaking color messages. Really, I want the old messenger app. I like change and progress, but it doesn't mean I like everything to change. Understand what I mean?\nI know my messenger rant probably sounds petty to some, but, it's one of the main things I use, so it bothers me.\nI will report more as I experience it.", "time": "02-25-2017 01:18 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5690947", "text": "Sounds like they got rid of the old Android Messaging app and replaced it with the Google Messenger/Android Messages app.", "time": "02-25-2017 01:40 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5690960", "text": "Yes, it is Android Messages.

I loved it. The UI of Nougat was easy on the eyes, intuitive, and fun to use. It also broke my phone.\nLuckily I was still under warranty so I received a new Turbo 2 from Motorola. At this time, I didn't realize it was the update that cause all my problems... I just thought that my phone was doing the abuse it put up with for a year.\nWhen I got the new phone, I wanted the update again to have all the Nougat features back. However, this was right around the time they pulled the update. I didn't realize they had until *after* I spent an hour on the phone with Verizon and Motorola. When I finally found out it was pulled, all the pieces came together, and I resentfully took heart that I was still running Marshmallow.\nEnter problems, stage left. After using my phone for a glorious three weeks, and deferring the the recently re-released update once a day out of fear, all of my offlined Spotify songs disappeared. I redownloaded them and kaboom. My phone heated up and never cooled down, my battery plummeted, and my phone would charge ridiculously slow. I half expected my phone to read that it was running Nougat, but it wasn't. I put up with these problems for about a week before realizing that my phone was no longer in warranty. At that point, I was at my wit's end with my Turbo and out of a twisted sense of rebellion, I updated my phone.\nEnter saving grace, stage right.\nMy battery problems were solved. My notification issues were solved. My charging issues were solved. I had one quickly-remedied issue with Netflix.\nMy battery last me three days on standby, all day with heavy usage.\nI'm not telling this story as a prescriptive bit of advice.

You may not get LTE data connections. \nAs for plans, I assume that you are on Verizon (since this is a Verizon proprietary phone.) You don't need a separate plan, but you should add international travel services to your plan for the time that you are away, because roaming charges otherwise are EXPENSIVE. Outside of Mexico/Canada, Verizon has a $10/day travel pass plan that uses your normal data while traveling, or a $25 plan that charges for minutes and texts with 100 MB of data in a month (not a lot of data), or a $40 plan with 100 MB and 100 calls and 100 texts sent (with no charge for texts received.) If you go over 100 MB on those plans, they change an additional $25 for 100 MB more. For Mexico and Canada the charge is $2/day for travel pass, or $10/month for 100 calls and texts and 100 MB data, or $25/month for 500 minutes, 500 texts, and 1 GB data.\nTravelpass is obviously a good choice if you're not away for all that many days, or if you are planning to make a lot of calls and/or use a lot of data.\nOr you can buy a SIM internationally that works in the country that you are traveling to. The Turbo 2 uses a nano SIM (the same as the iPhone, so they should be easy to find) and generally you'll pay a lot less than you will for Verizon's roaming plans, though, of course, if you're just planning to use the phone lightly, maybe not.\nSee http://forums.androidcentral.com/e?l...token=LorCJFwq for more info.", "time": "03-18-2017 03:41 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Droid Turbo 2 or Z Force?

Loved the battery life , which is really important to me but hated not having ability to expand storage. I am a photo hoarder and it kept telling me I had low storage. It lasted at least 4 years and when the last update was forced on it, it completely ruined it. Got stuck in the boot up mode and nothing could be done. I wasn't prepared to pick a new phone but had no choice. Spent hours in the store and the assistant was pushing me towards the Turbo 2 and Z Force. She seemed to prefer the Turbo 2 as it was more like my own phone but with storage. I am not good with change and the Force would also need the purchase of new charges. I was worried about the Turbo 2 not being the newest model and having problems but it was cheaper and closer to my old phone and I picked it. Well it has problems. I am not sure if it's a bad phone or just problems in general. Battery drained in front of my eyes with pretty moderate use the very first day. I just use it for internet surfing and FB and emails..no gaming. Literally from surfing the web from 5:40 am to about 6:30 it dropped every few minutes until it was at 73%. Then I let it sit for awhile and by 10am it was at 68%. By 2pm it was at 12%. Then my old turbo charger is having a hard time getting it to charge unless it is in \"just the right position\".

Once you enter an unlock code, that means that any other SIM can be placed in the phone.\nThis is great if you travel internationally, as Verizon has native signal in only the US and will have you roaming at a high cost in most foreign countries (although they do have international plans which are a little less costly.)\nAll Verizon LTE phones are no SIM unlocked - global phone use is one of their selling points vs. AT&T, though the truth is that AT&T will provide an unlock code if you are an active customer in good standing for a number of months (I believe it is 6 months), though that's a bit of a pain if you travel and forget to unlock before you leave.\nThe Droid brand phones, while unlocked, are exclusive to Verizon, so they determine the \"bloatware\" that is installed on them.\nManufacturers now sell phones that are unlocked for all carriers, and, starting just a month or so ago, Verizon has begun allowing you to activate phones that are unlocked on their network. So, in this case, Motorola can sell an unlocked Moto X Pure that has no bloatware, that is not SIM locked, and can be activated on AT&T (in this case, it will be unlocked), T-Mobile, and Verizon, as well as a lot of prepaid carriers. Because these phones are not sold by the carrier, they have only the bloatware that the manufacturer (Motorola) decides to put on them, if any.\nAny Droid brand phone that you buy will have the same bloatware on it, whether it's bought from Verizon or Motorola. I believe that I read somewhere that all of the non-Verizon apps on the phone (games, etc.) can be uninstalled (I don't know if that is true, as I don't have a Turbo 2), and, even if they cannot be uninstalled, you can disable them in settings / apps, so you will not see them in the app drawer and they will not receive Play Store update.", "time": "11-02-2015 10:56 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4798535", "text": "doogald,\nThank you for your very clear and helpful response.", "time": "11-02-2015 10:30 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4929372", "text": "You seem to be pretty knowledgeable about this subject so I wanted to ask you.

Level II support asked for my IMEI number, and apparently this number allows them to see a handful of real-time technical data about my phone... such as if I'm on WiFi, if I'm roaming, etc.\nThe first thing Level II support asked is that I go into the reset menu (Settings > Backup & Reset) and advise whether or not \"Automatic Restore\" is active, which it is on my phone. The support person advised that this makes a big difference because if it is active, a factory reset will NOT reset all settings to default. As the name of this function implies, many of the phone's settings will be automatically restored to previous values. DOH! When you do a factory reset, make sure this is DE-ACTIVATED.\nInitially the Automatic Restore button was grayed out and I couldn't change its' setting. Well, on the same menu, two selections up, you'll see the option to \"Back Up My Data\"; turn this on and you should see the Auto Restore function come online. I did another factory reset with this function turned off. The support person advised to NOT install any apps for 24 hours (interesting...) and that he'll call me back on Sunday to see if it's fixed.\nSo we'll see...if this doesn't fix my battery drain, the guy said we'll need to escalate to Level III support, whatever that is.\nOn the bright side, Motorola support is pretty darn good. I called the number listed above and got a real person within a reasonably short wait time.

It looks like Google is going to go their own way in better integrating the hardware with Android and I like the idea of constant updates. If I had to choose a new Android phone today (which I don't) I would probably pick the S7 (I like the size, specs, and camera) or perhaps a Z Play -- but I want to learn more about the camera before I warm up the Z Play.

It just has everything I need: smaller size, waterproofing, best camera, best 3rd party support. The infuriating thing is I can't seem to find a good deal on the S7 without going the refurb route.

This leads me to believe that while its low light performance might not match that of LG and Samsung, it will be better than the T2.

The only thing that will charge mine is a wireless charger which means I am tethered when I need to charge. We are supposed to have the glorious lightening charger but forget that, I can't even get a regular charger to work. I purchased my original device from Verizon in December 2015 and I've had two replacements. This is my third Droid Turbo 2 and the exact same issue. All Verizon will do is send refurbished devices that have the exact same issue. So now I'm at the point where Verizon contacted Motorola and they want me to send my phone to them and have no device for 2 weeks while they \"repair\" it. I am so mad and frustrated that I'm going contemplating legal action at this point. I want to know how many other people are having this issue. It is unacceptable to pay for a phone that is supposed to last two years, it doesn't last 6 months and I am still fighting for a resolution. I can't even tell you how many hours of my life I've wasted on the phone with Verizon customer service in the last few months. How can I be without my phone for two weeks??? Completely unacceptable. I moved recently and I use my GPS daily. There is no way I can go for two weeks without a phone. Completely unacceptable. How much do you think these phones even cost to make. Less than $100, I'm sure. It's not even worth someone's time to \"repair\" it. I'm really disappointed that Motorola won't just man up, admit they produced a phone that doesn't work and replace it with a new DIFFERENT working device. My husband is a design engineer and he knows it is a design flaw that cannot be repaired. I haven't decided if I'm jumping through more hoops and wasting more of my time or filing a lawsuit to get a resolution to this problem.", "time": "09-27-2016 06:44 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Non Motorola phones with Google Now Always listeniing?", "thread": [{"postID": "post5431323", "text": "I'm always looking for something new and different, but there's 2 or 3 features that are now a must-have for me. \nAlways Listening Google Now, and active touch-less display,, - a must for people like me with their phone on the night stand next to the bed where you wave your hand over the phone to see your alerts/messages and such.\nDoes any other phone companies have these features that work as seamless as the Motorola phones?", "time": "09-19-2016 10:44 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5440684", "text": "I can't think of a bigger invasion of my privacy than a phone that's listening to my every word.\nNot for me.", "time": "09-22-2016 10:27 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5445196", "text": "One can turn off Google Now.

And they have staked their premium pricing on their network as well as their security which is important more to corporate customers than consumers.\nI do think the Verizon will cave and eventually have WIFI calling on their Droid phones. But it isn't a priority.\nAnd I am a Verizon Prepaid customer. And WIFI calling is currently only available for Postpaid customers which is another indicator that Verizon is dragging their heals on implementing this feature.\nSuch is life.

I've tried literally every tweak in the book in my 2 months of owning the phone but it's stayed relatively the same: I can get anywhere from 3-6 hours SOT running the battery down to 0 depending on my usage and cell signal (my record is 7hr with VERY heavy usage at home on WiFi). I usually end the day with 30-50% battery, again depending on usage. It's possible for me to squeeze 2 days out of the battery since idle drain overnight is very low at 3-6%, but that's with very light usage and I almost always use my phone more than that. To be safe for the next day, I'll always top off nightly unless I have 60% or more battery remaining. I get these numbers with lots of web browsing, texting/calling/email, 30min-1hr of graphics intensive games, and occasional GPS navigation. I leave WiFi, location services (battery saving except during navigation), data, and auto sync on all the time, and turn bluetooth only when I use it. The screen is kept on the lowest brightness, but use a Tasker gesture to toggle on auto brightness when I need the screen to be brighter. Speaking of the screen, it seems to kill the battery faster than on any other phone I've owned and gaming hits it particularly hard too, which I chalk up to the software not being perfectly optimized with the SoC and the quad HD resolution. The screen drains 1% every 3-5 minutes, but it starts to drain a lot slower once the battery goes below 30%. And no, I didn't have battery saver mode turned on. This is a bummer since most of the time I plug the phone in before it drops below that level, which makes it seem like it has worse battery life than it actually does.\nAnother thing to note is that in my battery stats, the biggest drain is always something different. Sometimes it's the screen, sometimes it's Google services, sometimes it's Google Play Services, sometimes it's cell standby. It's all over the place, but the results are usually the same.\nIn all, it's an above average battery, although I feel like it can do better. I see quite a few Note 5 users getting 6-7 hours without root on a much smaller 3000MaH cell. While the Turbo 2 may not last the claimed 48 hours, it gets me through a day with power to spare, which is enough for me.

Never take any ad or salespersons guarantee on battery. It all varies by usage and they'll go by what they say is the \"average user\" or \"light usage\" to make it sound so appealing. One of the others on my team uses his hotspot and things greatly and therefore has to charge his phones 2 or more times a day. Is this normal usage?

If you have what we would consider light usage and what most people consider to be normal, you'll probably be able to eek two days out - but 48 is a silly number anyways. To get two full days out of a battery, you need about 42 hours, assuming you're charging at night every other day. And somewhere in the neighborhood of 6-8 hours of that will be sleeping, so doze takes over for that if you're not going to charge it overnight - so the device needs to be able to be used/idle for up to 42 hours, with only 34-36 of that being in motion, being used, etc. The obvious things like GPS, Screen, etc. are obviously still going to impact the overall usage. The 48 hour thing is a way of checking expectations, because it is relative to \"normal\" people. When the Moto X 2013, Moto X 2014 are both advertised to get 24 hours on the same \"normal\" usage, then the expectation, if you were getting 12 on those devices then it'd be reasonable to expect less than the full 48 advertised on this device. If like me, you were easily getting 16-18 hours (aka a full day) and charging each night out of those devices, expecting this device to last at least one full day and well into the next, if not the entire next day - might be pretty doable.

Thank you for providing this data, but honestly, as I've mentioned before, the turbo charging on this phone is capable of drawing 4 amps from the charger. I'm not sure what your background is, but as an electrical engineer, that is A LOT of power for a small device as a phone. Last night my phone reached 107.9 deg F turbo charging in just an idle state at home on WIFI and it was pulling 3.959 amps. In order to validate your statements of \"my note 5 was cooler\", you're going to need to provide the same data with the same tests on the note 5. If my hunch is right, I'm willing to say that samsung's fast charge isn't drawing as much current. It has a smaller battery, only 3000 mAh (20% smaller) so that will decrease the time that the charging stays in the \"fast mode\". And the shorter the time the phone stays in \"fast mode\" charging, the less heat that builds.\nIn the end, what I'm trying to say is, you're trying to make a comparison that is not apples to apples. I've looked for the charging specs for the note 5, but I can't find them, but my gut is telling me that it just doesn't pull the same amount of current. If you're that worried about the heat, don't use the turbo charger, buy yourself a couple anker chargers that will still provide a good amount of current to keep up with the heavy loads of navigation, hotspot, etc.", "time": "11-06-2015 08:22 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4808654", "text": "Fair enough.

I am getting approximately 2.5-3 hours from a full charge, even when the phone sits idle on my desk. The phone also heats up to 100-110*f on the rear of the device while this is occurring. Turbopower charging is extremely slow due to the fact that the phone is using power almost as fast as it's charging.\nPower cycling the phone has no effect. The only thing I have found that does help is turning on Airplane Mode for about 15 minutes, then switching it off. Once I do this, the battery life will return to normal, but out of the blue, the device will start heating up and chomping battery again.\nThe main power hog appears to be Google Services. Before you ask, I've cleared the cache and data for Google Services, Google Play Store, and Google Services Framework. I also performed a factory reset on the device on Monday night, and it didn't help matters at all. The only way to improve it is to enable and later disable Airplane Mode.\nDoes anyone have a suggestion on how to alleviate the issue?

(Sorry, don't want to be a buzz kill but it does.) You will be able to feel the flash and the finger nail will catch the edge of the flash. There's enough gap/lip that a new shatter shield will in fact fill. I'm not bothering to spend the $30 to get a new one because I'm over this phone unfortunately. If you were to order one, don't stick it on until you dry test it to see the difference. You'd have it on standby anyway if yours does have it already and could use it once the original gets scratched up, peels off like mine, etc.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "06-29-2016 08:14 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "How do i disengage sleep mode on my turbo2", "thread": [{"postID": "post5243537", "text": "How do I disengage sleep mode under settings display I want my turbo 2 to remain on not go to sleep after 30 minute maximum time allotment", "time": "06-28-2016 04:41 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5243587", "text": "Mod Note, I will move this to the t2 forum for more visibility", "time": "06-28-2016 05:34 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Fast charging cables.", "thread": [{"postID": "post5240591", "text": "I need a fast charging USB cable for the moto x force so I can charge it fast with my power bank I have.

Of course, if you damage the interior lens when removing the consumer replaceable protective lens or do not replace it with a comparable protective lens, then that wouldn't be covered. However, removing the lens AND replacing it with a comparable non-Motorola protective lens DOES NOT void warranty. In fact, even if you just removed the protective lens but didn't put anything back, should the power button stop functioning, then Motorola would still be legally required to repair the power button under warranty.

For example, if you put a tempered glass screen protector on in place of the OEM one, drop the phone, and the tempered glass breaks and damages the lens behind it, it's likely that won't be covered by the warranty. But if the touch-responsiveness stops working, that's on another layer that the screen protector isn't in contact with, and so shouldn't have been affected by the protector, and should still be covered by the warranty. Legally they would need to prove that the non-OEM part caused or contributed to the damage to get out of warranty coverage. Of course, they can still argue about it, and I'd still try to swap back to an OEM protector before returning the phone for warranty repair/replacement, just to avoid an argument, because it's easier than going to court over a smartphone repair.\nThis is the same thing that protects car owners who modify their vehicles. If you put a performance intake on the car, they can't claim the warranty is void to get out of fixing a broken heated seat, which clearly has nothing to do with the intake.

When I plug my phone into my computer via MTP and go to my SD card in windows explorer, the folder named \"Music\" should contain 70+ folders, each with a bunch of .mp3 files in it. This seems like a fairly normal way of storing music to me.* Sometimes everything is kosher and I see all my folders, and can move/copy/rename or whatever I'm there to do.\nBut sometimes not all the folders are there. Specifically, it shows the first 52 folders alphabetically. While this problem comes and goes, whenever it rears its ugly head the number 52 is a constant. Coincidentally that also means that I can't see any folders that come alphabetically after the letter M. It's as if the phone has some kind of problem with Nirvana. For an intermittent problem, this seems... oddly consistent.\nPlaying around/testing this, I took every folder starting with the letter H (there were a bunch) and moved them to their own folder. Then I unplugged and rebooted the computer for good measure, plugged the phone back in, and the missing folders are still missing. Now I have 28 folders, still stopping alphabetically at the letter M. Still no Nirvana for me.\nI googled around, educated myself as to what the heck MTP even is and lamented the demise of USB Mass Storage mode, and finally started searching for this specific issue, expecting to find some known issue with \"Android 6.0 showing 52 folders maximum\" or something. Doesn't look like this is a common problem. Or if it is, my google-fu must be very weak.\nIncidentally I can pull out my SD card, plug it into my computer, and all my files and folders are where they're supposed to be. Obviously pulling out my SD card every time I want to mess with the files on it is a little impractical, since doing so also removes the SIM card on this device.

I NEVER said the battery has a sensor in it that reports charge state. Phones do NOT have charge state circuitry whatsoever. Phones DO read battery voltage FROM THE BATTERIES VOLTAGE OUTPUT IN REALTIME and the PHONE reports that TO THE USER.. But that circuitry does NOT affect charge rate. Only the charger does that. Circuitry IN THE CHARGER keeps the battery from over charging, circuitry IN THE BATTERY also prevents this by reporting its size/capcity. NO circutiry in devices ever prevent nor read this, UNLESS a propretary battery is used, such as in MOTOROLAS (how many times have we seen the message \"Battery missing or non standard battery present\" after installing a higer capacity 3rd party battery in a moto phone?)\n. Devices can measure heat, yes, but they can NOT stop a charging cycle due to that heat - a phone CAN however shut a phone OFF to mitigate any heat damage. Perhaps phones will be able to communicate with chargers in the future, presently isnt happening.\nA charger knows when to stop when it cant charge anymore; when the resistance rises to the level that the BATTERY circuitry states - if a battery says \"I am a 3400mah\" that is what the charge will adjust to - if the charger can. THe Turbo Charge for the Droids CAN and do just that. This is why you can charge a higher capacity battery in the same phone (if fitted properly by design) and that battery will charge fully - a larger capacity will take longer, of course.\nI li-ion battery will NEVER overcharge UNLESS the charger is faulty, and most modern charges fail safe to OFF trather than FULL CLOSED circuit - the phone can NOT prevent that. As a matter of fact, when a phone reports a battery is at 100% it actually is not at 100%. But battery university has a great article on that very subject. But, I dont want to further confuse you.\nBTW, the BATTERY INDUSTRY calls it \"trickle\", not just laymen.\nOMG< that last thing you said? \"Applying charge to a lithium ion battery pack, however small, when it is fully charged can be very dangerous.\" No, as you said yourself, a full or near full charged battery will trickle, which is true.\nYou are quite confused on maNY PARTS REGARDING CHARGING, CHARGE RATES, CHARGE PROTECTION.\nYou need to read many more articles from your link.\nFrom the link you provided:\n\"...manufacturers of Li-ion cells are very strict on the correct setting because Li-ion cannot accept overcharge. The so-called miracle charger that promises to prolong battery life and gain extra capacity with pulses and other gimmicks does not exist. Li-ion is a \u201cclean\u201d system and only takes what it can absorb.\"\nLi-Ion CAN NOT ACCEPT OVERCHARGE - that isn't a safety statement, that is a factual statement. YOU CANT OVER CHARGE a Li-Ion battery because it is not possible to overcharge one BY DESIGN. You read that wrong.\nLi-Ion only takes what it CAN absorb, meaning it canNOT take any more by design - that isn't a warning of any kind. It is more of a heads up \"Don't try it, because it wont work, you will gain nothing from trying to overcharge it\". You read that wrong as well.\nAnd, from the same article, trickle has no place in Li-Ion. Topping, however, does. Topping is NOT trickle - they are NOT related. Also, from your link: \"Some Li-ion packs may experience a temperature rise of about 5\u00baC (9\u00baF) when reaching full charge. This could be due to the protection circuit and/or elevated internal resistance.\" BATTERIES HAVE THEIR OWN PROTECTION CIRCUITS AS WELL.\nThis proves you did NOT read the whole article - you stopped at the point in which you THOUGHT you were correct and made incorrect assumptions. That said, they need to re-write the article, it is rife with grammar errors that would fool a 5th grader in an AP English class.\nAnd before you rebut with the last paragrpah, \"Chargers for consumer products go for maximum capacity and cannot be adjusted; extended service life is perceived less important.\" Yes, adjustments to prevent 100% charge, which isnt necessary really - can only be made with special chargers, and then, the battery has to be removed in order to take advantage of special chargers,. Droid Turbo 2 battery removal is MUCH more difficult than with the Droid 1 through 4 series.\nAlso, \"the battery becomes unstable if inadvertently charged to a higher than specified voltage\" Of course. But no consumer charger can inadvertently cause overcharging, even a faulty charger is highly UNlikely to cause overcharging.\nFinally, for now, this article has NO report on how TURBO charging works, and Turbo Charging is QUITE different than previous standard voltage and low voltage Li-Ion charging.

I spend hours a day on the phone so my SOT is not as high, but overall I end up with more battery life at the end of the day with this phone than I topically did with the T1. The Maxx was a little better, but not drastically. \nAt this point I think part of it is just perception based on differences in the way the battery stats are interpreted by each device. On the original Maxx, the first 50% would seem endless but once below 50%, it would discharge much faster. This could lead to the perception early on in a given day that it would last much longer than it actually will. And with the T1, a bit of the same, once it got to 30% or so, I noticed a much faster decline. On the T2 it seems to discharge more consistently all the way down to zero, and in particular the last 30% really seems to hold. This will lead to the perception at an earlier point in the day that you're set up to run out sooner than you would've with the Maxx/T1, but in reality when you look at the averages, I find that it's actually very comparable, and better than the T1 by a little bit.\nIn other words, I think a lot of us here are really subjectively comparing this phone to two completely separate phones, and disparaging the SOT (As in calling it complete trash) capabilities for 5 hours average is kind of ridiculous. I'm not sure what a lot of these other phones with 2800MAH or 3000MAH batteries get, but how many extra hours does an additional 800-1000MAH capacity really buy you?

I also tapped the \"Check for system update\", and it reported \"Your device's software is up to date\", even though it reported itself that it was *not* up to date and had just failed installing the update.\nHere is the fix:\nConnect the phone to a PC (mine is Win 7, but probably any current version of Windows will work. Not sure about if this process can be done on a Mac). The USB driver loaded itself and then the \"Verizon Wireless Software Upgrade Assistant\" program prompted to run. I ran it, chose to do an Upgrade instead of a Repair. The program appears to download the entire Marshmallow upgrade via the PC's FiOS connecton and then apply everything to the phone. Not sure how long it took since I walked away after awhile, but probably 30-40 min.\nWhen done the phone was left running 6.0 and the \"System Version\" (which is what hung originally) under the \"System update history\" says 24.14.11.en.US.\nWeirdly, in the \"System updates\" page under the \"Last System Update\" section it still says:\n\"Software not update to 23.31.24.en.US\nDownload failed - March 11, 2016 at 9:35PM\nBut everything appears to be completely current. Only had it off the charger for a few hours now the next day, but seems to be running normally.\nVisual Marshmallow changes are minimal -- superficial or trivial, almost. I'm sure there may be significant differences under the hood, but from the user's perspective not much difference. I do agree with complaints lodged here and elsewhere regarding the volume control change, removal of easy access to enabling/disabling the \"Priority\" alerts under the volume control, and some other things. I particularly don't like the dumbing down of the Apps page in Settings. The dropdown to switch between \"All apps\", \"Enabled\" and \"Disabled\" isn't an improvement over swiping from one screen to the next; it's just different. What is worse is the moving of the \"Running\" processes to a Developer page and the inability to sort the apps by size in the Apps page. Sorting under size is now under \"Apps storage/Internal storage\". Again, different for different's sake, but not an improvement. The OS should allow you to see it in both places.\nAnyway, I'm glad the update appears to have installed successfully after an initial hiccup. I'm ambivalent about such \"upgrades\" anyway. The risk of borking the phone during the install is far greater for me than any benefit from Marshmallow (which is none, so far as I can tell). I'd have stayed happily on Lollipop if I'd been able to, since the phone was running awesome with it and didn't need an \"upgrade\". I'm still running 4.3 on my Nexus 10 tablet because the \"upgrades\" caused all sorts of issues with Wifi, battery life, etc. The tablet was engineered with 4.3 in mind, not 5.0+ in that case.

One of the reasons I'm not yet convinced that they've formally \"pulled\" the update is that we started hearing reports of them having done so a couple of weeks ago (don't remember exactly when I first started seeing reports of people quoting Verizon cust svc people stating this). At the time, two of our three DT2's had gotten the update over the air, but one never seemed to get the \"offer\" to update, and always reported the phone being up to date when we checked it for updates. Despite a handful reporting that the update had been \"pulled\", I tried using VSUA with my laptop to update the third phone -- repeatedly, trying different cables, making sure I used the laptops's USB 2.0 port, etc -- no joy with this first laptop (Dell XPS 15 / 9530). I then tried the same phone, same cables, on a different laptop (2014 model Lenovo), and on the third try, VSUA actually offered the update, downloaded and installed it to the third DT2. It took a long time, but in the end, worked out perfectly.\nClearly the over-the-air and VSUA processes are buggy and inconsistent. I'm not aware of either having done any harm, but they seem to be poor at offering a consistent and reliable experience for end users. Note, however, that despite stories of Verizon support folks stating the the update had been pulled, with perseverance - and using the official Verizon-provided process - I was able to get the download on the one phone that had given me trouble.\nSo - this one bit of experience, combined with numerous stories over the years of some Verizon customer service folks passing off folklore as fact (not all, btw - I've spoken with a few very good ones), is what makes me hesitate to accept as fact that the Marshmallow update for the Droid Turbo 2 has, in fact, been pulled.

At some point you could have done an FDR, and at the very least you would have ruled out that being a solution to your problem, and at best you would have solved your problem.\n(FWIW, FDR is not much of a pain for me. I use an app called DropSync to synchronize key internal storage folders to Dropbox automatically, so after doing an FDR I just copy the folders back after the apps are reinstalled and reconfigure sound and notification settings for my apps. [One of those folders that's backed up are my custom ringtones and notification tones.] I also back up text messages and call logs using SMS Backup+, so those are always up to date. I keep a pretty stock home screen with only one screen, so that's easy to reset. Google needed to improve this on Android years ago,; iOS is a piece of cake by comparison to restore from the equivalent of an FDR. I do this not only to make FDR not too much of a pain; I want to be able to get myself up and running quickly if my phone is lost or stolen, or needs to be warranty replaced, or when I get a new phone.)\nSUA is a *little* risky - flashing the phone is always risky - and I honestly don't think it will solve your WiFi problem. I think that your problem is due to one of a couple of things:\n1. You have an app that has the permission set control the WiFi radio\n2. There is a bug in Lollipop, or a permission in one of Google's apps, that does the same.\nIf it is number 1, it will not be solved by SUA. If it is number 2, it will not be solved by SUA, either, but likely will by M. \nI suppose it could be:\n3. An installed app has corrupted data\nGuess what will solve number 3? (Either FDR or uninstall and reinstall every app until you find the one that caused the issue, if there is one. And if it is a preinstalled app, only the FDR or wiping data for all of those will help, and than can be dangerous for some system app.)\nBut, you can try it, it's probably benign and maybe I am wrong about it solving your problem. But, again - the Marshmallow upgrade is going to do the equivalent of SUA when it comes (i.e, replace all of the system files and firmware files with stock copies; the M update will touch every one of those), and we know it should be coming soon. Here's the thing: if you are unrooted, you cannot change the system apps or settings through normal operation of the phone or using apps anyway - the system partitions are read only (and they are write protected on Motorola phones even if you are rooted.) That's why I think SUA will make no difference - if it's some esoteric setting, those are set in the data partition, and those are only changed by clicking the right setting, or - yes - a factory data reset. \nYou've been pointing out battery issues for weeks now, so I'd suggest that rather than do the SUA now, you may as well just wait a week or two more and then take action after the M upgrade if the problems persist.

I wouldn't suggest an FDR at any random moment, but I think you should have some sort of plan or process to ensure that you can recover in case you have to do one. Among other things, I use an app to sync my critical files from internal storage to Dropbox (though it could be to anything - Google Drive, Box, OneDrive) and an app that backs up call logs and text and MMS messages to a Google calendar and my Gmail account.\nThey say that Google has finally fixed M so that backups and restores after an FDR at least comes close to how well iOS does it.\nThat said, I like to upgrade ASAP, including participating in soak tests. But I would counsel anybody to hold off for a few days to a week, or just wait for your phone to prompt you for an update, just so you can look in forums like this one for any issues that may crop up.

Google generally does a good job of recognizing when you're on a new device and your apps need to be downloaded. Very worst case, from my perspective, is that I might have to nudge Google to download my apps, and then I would have to restore whatever settings it didn't capture. This would be an inconvenience, but not a disaster. With that in mind, I like to dive in as soon as something appears reasonable -- and, especially after a couple of soak tests and further delay to address something they caught during release, my impression is that Verizon was trying to be fairly diligent about this release.\nI may have had my head in the sand, but the vast majority of the reports I've read about Marshmallow have been positive. There will always be a few who experience problems, but I haven't seen any kind of pattern that concerned me. I also compared notes with half a dozen friends who already received marshmallow on their devices (a mix of Nexus 6P and other phones), and none of them had any issues at all.\nThe two updates took some time. The first was pretty fast, especially considering that I was working over a Wi-Fi network in a hotel I'm staying at - and their Wi-Fi is generally abysmal. Update 1 took about 15 or 20 minutes end to end. Update 2 was a lot bigger -- over a 1GB download. Both worked just fine - no hesitation, errors, etc.\nEverything I've tried since the update has worked perfect, and everything feels crisper and snappier. As people have reported, stand-by time is superb, as the phone now barely sips anything while it's dozing. Perhaps unlike others, I actually seem to be getting better battery life during interactive use as well.\nNot sure if it's my imagination, but WiFi handling seems smoother and faster, and bluetooth is still excellent. \nOverall - very happy with Marshmallow on my DT2.", "time": "03-10-2016 11:12 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5050193", "text": "Fair enough.

I've always been on Verizon, which has worked well for me as a frequent traveler, so I've stayed tied to phones that are available for their network, starting with the Palm Pre as my first smartphone then the Thunderbolt, then the Droid RAZR Maxx HD, followed by the Droid Maxx, then after that I was faced with the choice between the Droid Turbo 2, the Nexus 5X, and the N6P. I've often wondered if I would have been an iPhone user all along if the iPhone hadn't been exclusive to AT&T for so many years before it became available on Verizon.\nI really, really liked the Droid Maxx. If it had received regular updates, or even if it had at least been updated to Lollipop, I might still be using it, though my unit had developed a random restart issue that for the life of me I couldn't seem to fix. I guess I was holding out hope that an update to Lollipop might solve it, but the promised update just never came (and it's now been officially killed). Having never had a Nexus phone, I had almost gotten used to NEVER having the latest OS. But being the tech geek that I am I was constantly checking forums to see when/if an update might come. This is all a way of emphasizing that this constant pining for the latest OS was starting to feel ridiculous when my wife's iPhone was always updated right away along with my father-in-law's Nexus 6.\nSo, I started considering new phones last fall just as a lot of great options were coming out. I vacillated for months between the DT2, the N5X, and the N6P. Mainly the choice was between another Droid or the Nexus 6P because to me the N6P ultimately became kind of a no-brainer between the two Nexus options. I hated to give up wireless charging, especially. That one thing made me put off the decision more than anything else. But I also hated the idea of getting another Droid and immediately starting that cycle of pining after the latest OS knowing that even when/if it came it would be only weeks before yet another new version of Android would be released, and that version would probably never be available on my new phone.\nThen there's the security stuff on top of the OS updates. The reality is that most important Android updates now come through apps in the Play Store and updates to Google Play Services. This is often overlooked. The OS changes themselves are mostly cosmetic. This is a major difference between Android and iOS. There aren't many (any?) Android apps that don't continue to run just fine when you're one or two or even three Android versions behind, unlike iOS where eventually an older iPhone or iPad just becomes useless because the apps stop getting updates and many apps you can't download at all. But now we have to worry about security updates, or at least we're told that we have to worry about security updates. The Droid phones will probably never receive one. single. security update.\nSo, I bought myself a Nexus 6P, which I had read worked just fine on the Verizon network, and because my Maxx had a nano sim, all I had to do was order the phone, take the sim out of one phone and insert into the other, and I was off and running. It was even easier than I imagined it would be because now Android phones somehow see each other (I guess it must be NFC), and the settings just automatically transfer over to the new phone. I haven't had a single problem with my N6P, which has received one Marshmallow update since I've had it plus three monthly security updates, with the next coming in just a week or two. With the reversible and easy to plug in USB-C charger (just like Lightning connector on iPhones), I haven't missed wireless charging nearly as much as I thought I would.\nI also have to agree with the an earlier poster that the N6P just looks more elegant than the DT2., and I have to admit that the design and overall look of the N6P made a difference for me as well. I think the N6P and the iPhone 6s Plus are almost two sides of the same coin, which is probably what Google and Huawei were aiming for. Not everyone likes that or even gives a hoot, but it did matter to me.\nThat's my story. I'm still kind of a recovering Droid owner, and I do miss the better implementation of active display that Motorola offers. Nexus 6p has its own active display, but it's very inconsistent. I'm hoping that this gets better in later versions of Android, which of course now I can count on receiving for at least the next couple of years!", "time": "02-27-2016 01:47 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5022064", "text": "I have never owned a Nexus but have owned a variety of other phones.

I don't use Qi, and since I had the Steelie wart on the back of my case, my phone wouldn't charge wirelessly anyway. I bought the mount and put it in my car.

It's \"robotic\" but in doing a little research, it seems like it has to do with the Advanced Calling Video Chat setting. If it's on, even if you're only making Voice calls, it's got the robotic \"warble\" to it but if you turn that and leave the HD Voice on it's supposed to be better. I haven't made a call after turning it off to see though.\nAs for the camera, I have taken a few pics and they are okay. The camera software is very rudimentary and in most cases that's okay, but it seems to overcorrect on the white balance and doesn't really give you any way to adjust. I was trying to take pics of a Christmas tree with lights that were sort of a warm white with an amber glow and it over corrected to make them stark white and got rid of the yellow. Everything seems to shift blue and it seems to want to make everything shift to the cool color space. I kept going back and forth trying to decide between the T2 and either the LG V10 or the LG G4 because they have such great camera software and hardware. I am still in my 14 day period and I may yet swap out for one of them.

I noticed this myself because I was panicking to see similar stats initially. Here's my thought:\nI believe that the way these stats and the forecast remaining battery life are reported is being unduly influenced by your usage since you just took the phone offer the charger.\nForgetting GSam for the moment and just looking at the Android approximation of battery use: you've had the phone off-charger for 2h 50m. In that time, you've had the screen on for 1h 38m == 57.6% of the time. If your usage since coming off charger remains consistent for the remaining 6 hours of forecast battery life, this would give you approx another 3.46 hours of screen-on time, for a total forecast screen-on time of approx 5 hours. That's not bad at all, but you can probably do better.\nStill seeing a lot of awake time on your phone, and GSAm is showing that 34% of the charge has been consumed by \"App Usage\" - something to consider and study a bit more closely on your phone.\nFor comparison:\nI leave bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned on all the time on my phone, and I have location services on constantly. I really don't want to have to worry about compromising my use of these conveniences when the phone is so capable -- and this hasn't been a problem for me. I have screen brightness at about 45% - not because I'm trying to conserve battery, but because I like the way it looks; I only crank it up brighter if I expect to be outside for a while in bright daylight. I also have adaptive brightness turned on.\nI have Sleep set to activate after 30 seconds, but I also have a habit of tapping the power button briefly to turn the screen off any time I'm doing using the phone. Under \"Attentive Display\" I have both \"Stay On...\" and \"Battery saver mode...\" checked.\nI only have a relatively small number of apps disabled:Amazon KindleAmazon Appstore (I get my apps via Google Play)AudibleCalendar (I use Google Calendar instead)Caller Name IDCloudDT IgniteMessage+NFL MobileSlacker Radio (I used Google Play Music all access / family)VZ Navigator\nI do NOT have Facebook or FB Messenger installed. I could probably disable several more of the apps that VZW installs by default, but my battery life has been generally excellent, and the \"urgency\" to improve on the current state is just not there. I get several hours a day of screen on time and simply don't worry about limiting my usage -- just not an issue. I have Nine email client handling about 60 to 80 emails a day (exchange server / corporate) on a push basis, and GMail managing anywhere from 50 to 100 in a typical day. Amazon shopping and Amazon music are active. I use Google Play Music extensively. The Delta (airlines) app is active. Guardian, Flipboard and Google News & Weather are always updating in the background. I use Nova Prime (at the moment!) as my launcher. Numerous apps installed. Google Docs / Drive is actively syncing in the background, as is MS Office via apps like Word, Excel, Powerpoint.\nWith all this - I'm probably getting about 5.5 to 6 hours screen on time -- although I have yet to run down the battery before I go to sleep at night, and actually haven't gone below about 20% yet -- more typically about 30% to 40% remaining at night, with total forecast battery life at about 36 hours.

I'd say that the best way to deal with that is to reduce the brightness to as low as you absolutely need. It's too bad that the Moto decided to go with such a hi-res display. At this size 1080p would have been more than good enough. All those extra pixels don't add much but draw a lot of power to light them up.

It would seem almost impossible in my mind that manufacturing variability, or defective units would be responsible for these types of disparities, but it seems weird to me that so many people are so surprised at the apparent worse performance.

The corner hit a hard tile floor, from only about 1 ft. Screen shattered.  I was so upset, I usually take very good care of my stuff. Put clear shipping tape across the screen so it wouldn't slice my fingers. It actually worked pretty good! I like the Moto X. My only complaints are that it doesn't have an SD card slot and the battery isn't great. I noticed the fairly-new Droid Turbo 2 has SD and a bigger battery. Hmmm...\n12-26: Went to local Verizon store. They had a special for the Turbo 2, trade-in a smartphone (even with a cracked screen) and get $200 off my bill. Seemed like a good deal, I needed a new phone, so I said OK, gimme a T2! I didn't want the montlhy payments, so I paid the $200 (+tax on full price). They were out of stock.  They ordered one for me. I noticed the receipt was not Verizon, but some wireless company. This used to be a Verizon corporate store, but I guess not anymore. Oh, well, phone is ordered. What can go worng? \n12-30: Picked up my shiny new T2! I asked about the $200 trade-in, they told me I would get a text with instructions in about 5 days.\nJan 7: Did not receive a text about the trade-in.\nJan 8: Still no text, or email, or anything about the trade-in.\nJan 9: Went to the store and talked with the manager, he said he would check with his rep and send me an email, maybe later that night. Never got an email (didn't really expect to).\nJan 10: Called Verizon customer service (very friendly and helpful). I asked about my trade-in info. She looked up my account and said it doesn't show that I qualify for the trade-in offer. She did some more searching (or whatever she was doing), and found that the trade-in is only good if you do the device payments, not for the the 2-year contract price as I did. (It would have been nice if the store told me that.) She told me I could go back to the store and have them move me to the monthly payments but, because they are in independant store, their price may not be the same as online or in a corporate store. She said if it's much higher, I can returen the T2 and go to a corporate store or order online. Online price is $21.83/mo (there is a special for the T2, $100 off full price). Went back to the store. Walked by the T2 display. $27.45/mo! OK, I'm returning my brand new T2. Yes, I have to pay a \"restocking\" fee, but I still come out ahead. And I feel the store was not honest with me (or didn't know what they were selling) and then gave me a run-around, so I really don't want to give them my business.\nWent home and logged into my Verizon account to make sure my old phone was back on the account and that it is again eligible for an upgrade. It was, and it was.\nWaiting a few days for my account to cool off. \n1-16: Ordered my new T2, online. Also made sure I got the $200 trade-in and the free 32 GB SD card.

To me, it does not feel like a HUGE upgrade, but it does feel like a pretty good upgrade. I haven't fiddled much with it yet, but here are the first things I noticed with it:\nThe phone processor is hella quicker.\nThe screen looks nicer.\nThe camera is better.\nMore buying options let you choose a phone that feels comfortable to you (leather, nylon or soft shell).\nI like having a stock flashlight come with the phone (I haven't tried the motion controls yet to open it)\nAs you can see, I only have a short list since I have barely gotten into it.\nI can't vouch for the battery yet. My Maxx seems to have lost its edge, and I actually had to plug it in after only half a day yesterday. Admittedly, I was heavily researching what phone I wanted to upgrade to, so I may have had hours of screen time, but the battery just didn't seem to last as long after almost 2 years. I remember using it easily for 2 days and 1 night (~40 hours) back then. I'm reserving my judgement of the new battery right now, but I received it around 3pm today with 53% battery and I'm now at 22% about 10 hours later. To its credit, I did drive 120 miles, so it may have lost some on the trip while looking for signals, but I wasn't using it at all in the car. I'm gonna let it drain down and then give it a full charge tomorrow and test it out the longevity. We all know we can't judge the first charge or 2.\nI was worried that I wouldn't like the feel of the new shatterproof screen. I never have shattered a phone, and the shatterproof screen wasn't a selling point for me; I only wanted the battery. I never use screen protectors or cases, so I am used to the feel of stock glass under my fingers. Knowing this came with a screen protector on it, and knowing that I shouldn't remove it, I fiddled with the one at the store, and had no more worries about it. The new one out of the box felt even better than the \"dirty\" store one. Since I have both of the phones in front of me, I CAN feel a slight difference between the Maxx and the Turbo 2 when sliding across the screen, but it is small enough to not worry about.\nWhen I got the Droid Maxx, I told myself that it was as big of a phone as I ever could use. I almost didn't want to get the Turbo 2, since it was even larger, but I have been too spoiled by battery life with these lines of phones. I just couldn't see myself in an S6 or M9 (which were about the size of the Droid Maxx) and having to charge it midday or when I get home from work. I can just barely use this Turbo 2 one-handed.\nOverall though, no complaints and zero buyer's remorse.

The problem is that Motorola wants me to send the device back to them, and wait over 5 days without a phone OR charge me 25 dollars to get a phone sent to me before hand. I've have this phone less than two weeks and this is the service I get? \nCurrently I've talked to two supervisors, been bumped to level two service as well as went on to level two escalation after that.

All 3 arrived about 8 days later. Two were fine, and within 24 hours one kept randomly shutting off, despite being fully charged. We tried pretty much everything - uninstalled apps, wiped cache, factory reset. It was truly appearing to be a hardware issue of some sort, and it got progressively worse day by day after it first starting happening, and finally it became impossible to get the phone to start up again.\nI examined the bad phone and compared it to the two working phones. The only visible difference was what the OP described: the power button on the dead Turbo 2 was slanted: the top was normally extended, but the bottom of the button was somewhat collapsed into the phone. With the other, working phones, the button extends straight out from the side of the phone -- top and bottom equally extended, and the button remains properly perpendicular to the phone as I press it in to turn the phone on/off.\nI had to call Motorola customer service, was given a new redemption code, and had them build a replacement while I returned the dead phone. The new one arrived -- works perfectly -- and its power button is just like the other two working Turbo 2's: no slant to the power button at all.\nIn our case, I'm convinced that the power button was the source of the problem. No guarantee that a slanted power button means trouble, but if you find that on/off functions start becoming the least bit unusual or hesitant, I'd strongly consider looking for a replacement.\nJon", "time": "12-11-2015 08:54 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4889293", "text": "Wow thanks so much for the thorough post. \nI have only had one weird shutdown, but the phone was in someone else's hands so i cant say for sure whether they pressed the power button or not. \nBut it seems like this model has been having all sorts of issues.

First thing I learned was that rice works better as a desiccant if you dry it out thoroughly first. Even though it may feel dry to the touch, when it's in the box or bag on a shelf in your kitchen, it is at the same ambient humidity as the room it's been sitting in. If you spread out a couple of cups of dry rice in a baking dish and let it sit in an oven at 250 degrees (F) for half an hour, it will wind up with less moisture content, and be a more effective desiccant for your phone. If you don't use the rice for a day or two, I would go through the drying out process with it again.\nWhen you embed the phone in the rice, it can be warm - but clearly should not be HOT.\nIn my experience, phones that others through were totally dead due to being submerged have come back to life after about 3 days of being buried in rice heated and \"super-dried\" this way.\nJon", "time": "12-21-2015 08:06 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "What micro sd card is best for the Motorola Droid Turbo 2?", "thread": [{"postID": "post4865725", "text": "I am looking for opinions on this matter.", "time": "11-30-2015 03:30 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4865769", "text": "My opinion, for what it's worth - probably not much - is that it's best to buy the well-known expensive brands.", "time": "11-30-2015 03:50 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4865961", "text": "I agree.

It's too bad that you all had bad experiences with phone updates, but not so much for me. That's me, not you.

It's ok that you disagree with it. I'm just trying to explain why they don't highly rate a phone like the Turbo 2. For the hardware, it is expensive compared with other phones. It works only on a single carrier. It's unlikely to get speedy security and android version updates, and Verizon in particular has a really bad record updating their Droid brand phones, with the exception of a very brief period in late 2013 .

With my T1 I was often charging a tiny bit on the Turbo charger right before I went to bed, once I would hit 20% or so. I work late and often needed some juice to crank out those last few emails. After that I would go to sleep and charge so that I'm full when I wake up. With my T2 I've been at 40% or even higher at that time, to the point where I'm not even sure I want to charge it at all. And my SOT seems similar at that juncture - at the end of the night - but you're right it's hard to judge in that respect. But by your method of measurement, I'm confident that my T2 is doing significantly better than my T1. And my GSAM stats seem to bear that out. My average cycle before I sold my T1 - over a full year - was 20 hours, 20 min. and seemed to be trending down. But that was on lollipop which definitely made it worse than it originally was. And my T2 is currently averaging over 28 hours on a cycle, which matches up with how I've been feeling at night - close to wanting to charge but sometimes waiting until the next day because I still have enough to spare. My T1 I never questioned whether I needed to charge before I went to sleep. It was always a no brainer that I needed to. I guess my T2 is very close to what my T1 was on kit-kat, but that was almost too long ago to remember. \nIn all cases like you said, these last 3 iterations of this phone far exceed the average phone. I never really worry about needing to top off before going to sleep, and I can't really think of any other phones that allow that sort of flexibility.

Here's my two bits for what it's worth:\nBoth are good devices. Speed is about the same from what I can tell. T2 maybe has a slight edge. Very little difference in OS if you uninstall and deactivate bloat. T2 has wider bezel which adds slight width in comparison to the PE, but is smaller in length. The PE was heavier to hold by quite a bit I actually prefer the weight of the T2 better. It's less cumbersome than the PE with one hand. \nThe biggest difference between the two is the screen. T2 AMOLED is a bit oversaturated in blue and red. From that standpoint I actually liked the PE color better. It was in my opinion more accurate. However if the screen on the T2 is as durable as they claim, I'd sacrifice the color! I installed glass screen protector over outer lens and it's very nice. Fits perfect. Feels like glass. And doesn't seem to scratch as others have stayed with going stock outer lens. Well worth the the Verizon $$ in my opinion. \nHaven't really pushed battery yet, but seems quite a bit better on T2.\nI like the flat back on the T2 vs curved on PE.

I love this app. Having SMS conversations in GMail makes them easier to search, and calls on my calendar is great so I can check when calls were made, etc.\nSwiftkey for keyboards.\nI love the Google Now launcher, though Action Launcher is a close second.\nBeyondPod for podcasts (if you listen to those), though Pocket Casts is great, too.\nGoogle InBox if you use Gmail - it makes processing email more efficient for me. If you don't use Gmail for your primary mail client, there are a number of good clients in the Play Store that are much better than the stock mail client. (K9, Aqua Mail, Type Mail.) And if you want something like Google's InBox for non-Gmail, Dropbox's Mailbox app is also great.\nFlickr, Google Photos, or Dropbox for uploading photos to cloud storage automatically (so if you lose your phone, it breaks, etc., you won't lose any photos.)\nTapatalk (or, for here, the Android Central app) to access sites like this on the phone more efficiently.", "time": "12-01-2015 10:21 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4867249", "text": "I agree with going with Verizon Message+. \nI've tried other file managers but ES File Explorer covers all the bases.

The corners are oversized and rounded for maximum protection. The lip is big and raises the screen enough, even with a glass screen protector. The back of the phone presents a nice deep recess for the whole camera module. The color accent on the back around the camera appears perfectly, cutouts are great and generous (both mikes on the back are exposed and you can plug in an L-shaped earphone plug in the 3.5 mm jack (many cases are not designed to accommodate L-shaped plugs). This is not a real double layer case, as everything is fused together, plastic, translucent and somewhat flexible plastic, TPU. The back has this grid-like look to it, but they should have reserved a small area to display the \u201cDroid\u201d logo, that would have been amazing. Instead you get a fake screw and the grid over it. Huge waste of design effect there. I\u2019m using the grey version because my phone has the grey soft back. The case adds minimum bulk to the phone and increases the grip. Bye-bye to the whiners who dislike the design of the Turbo 2, the back (less shiny in real-life than in the pics) makes the phone look incredibly classy and slick.

Dumb.My left thumb cannot adjust volume, but that's what I get coming from a Note II. I'll get used to this I guess.The Home screen must be at far left. I'm used to my Home screen being wherever I want it, and I prefer screens to be on the left *and* right. Is there a setting for this?I cannot use screen dots at bottom to jump to screens. If I have 7 screens I have to swipe 6 times to make the last screen display. On my Note II I can just tap the last dot at the bottom to jump to the last screen. And similar for intermediary screens.The above gripe is true for the app drawer as well, and it's worse because there's more screens in the app drawer.\nThanks in advance.", "time": "11-17-2015 08:59 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4837830", "text": "You're using Swiftkey I'm guessing?

Second, use a cash back site such as eB@tes or TopC@shBack when you order to receive additional cash back on your order.\nCan I apply the $300 trade-in credit towards device purchase?\nYou can only do that if you do the transaction in-store. If you purchase online, you will either get a gift card or account credit for $300. Read the next question to see if you can use this for paying off the device.\nCan I use the $300 trade-in e-GiftCard or account credit to pay for the device?\nYou cannot use account credit to pay off device balances (unless you close your account, see next question). You can use the $300 eGiftCard to pay off device balances that are less than $300. This is because Verizon allows only a single payment method to pay off device balances. You cannot use a gift card to pay off device balances that are greater than the gift card balance, nor can you use multiple gift cards and/or multiple payment methods. Period. \nDoes this mean I am stuck with account credits or gift card(s) if my device balance is more than $300?\nIf you cancel your account with Verizon, then you will receive a final bill. You can pay the final bill using multiple payment methods. If you have account credits, Verizon will consider it in the final bill (any outstanding credits will be applied to your bill). \nCan I just pay off the device balance and cancel my account immediately after purchase?\nA couple of days back, Verizon added a new written clause in their trade-in screen: \"If you received promo value when trading in a device and/or instant device savings, you will be charged for that value if you do not maintain active service for three billing cycles, unless you return the device within 14 days.\" All earlier promos didn't have this requirement, and hence people were able to cancel their account immediately. It is unclear how Verizon is going to approach this promo with updated terms. If you want to be very sure, just stay with Verizon for 3 months. \nCan I trade in a cracked phone?\nOn speaking to online rep and on the site a cracked phone can only be traded in for a Droid Charge Turbo.", "time": "11-26-2015 07:26 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4859402", "text": "Unfortunately their online store won't let me keep my UDP with these deals, or even at full retail.

The Turbo 2 won't charge at all with my Nokia Wireless Charging plate (DT-900), or the original Nexus \"ball\" wireless charger, or the Nexus 5 wireless charger \"square\".

Once you get the $300 gift card (new to Verizon) or account credit (current customer) you can simply pay the remaining 0% interest payments off. Of course if you are sticking with Verizon I don't know why one would pay off a 0% loan but hey that's up to you. In the last couple of weeks I have done this with LG G4 (which also has $100 instant rebate via Verizon and $200 mail in rebate from LG that took about 2 weeks), an Iphone 6s + and most recently with the Moto Droid Turbo 2. The phones I used for the rebate include (2) Kyocera Hydro phones (which are really, really old technology that I bought a year ago refurb for $15 each). Understand this is not the \"any phone including cracked screen\" that applies to just the Droid Turbo 2 but any phone sold by Verizon. The Droid offer from Verizon simply adds the cracked screen option to the offer that applies to all Verizon phones right now.

Lots of sales people with only partial information. After some frustration, and finally talking to the store manager, I wound up working with one who actually knew how this deal worked.\nSeems that super cheap pre-paid phones were working as recently as 24 hours ago, but as of today, the Verizon system was apparently being tweaked to reject a number of them, such as NET10 phones. We had them look up my son's iPhone 4 -- and they offered us $11 for it in trade -- even though it was immaculate and worked perfectly. We went to Walmart and picked up a couple of Verizon pre-paid phones at $40 a piece, and a couple of ZTE prepaid phones for AT&T - also $40, and Verizon's system accepted them as trade-ins to qualify us for the full $300 credit. So it cost a bit, but the net was the we got $1200 credit in exchange for spending $160.\nThe deal requires either porting-in from another carrier, or adding a new line to your existing plan. I had four lines -- and we added four lines to get four new phones with $300 credits each -- an iPhone 6 and three Turbo 2's. There's no contract required - just an agreement to pay off the remainder of the phone cost over 24 months. You can immediately have the new phones reassigned to your old pre-existing phone numbers. The only other stipulation to avoid penalties is that you must keep the new lines for 30 days before you can cancel them. So yes - you'll pay the line charge for the extra lines, but only for one month.\nBottom line: as an existing customer, I spent $160 on four pre-paid phones to use as trade-ins, and will have to pay for four lines for one month at $20 per month. Total outlay $240, to get $1200 in credit, net = $1060 credit toward the purchase cost of four new phones.\nI didn't opt for the LG G4 -- but you should know that through tomorrow, 11/15, LG is offering a $200 incentive to purchase an LG G4 on Verizon. Verizon's full charge for that phone is $552. If you do the pre-paid trade-in as I did, and pay for a new line for one month, you'll wind up with $440 in credits and rebates toward a $552 phone, effectively getting a new LG G4 for $112. Again - the G4 option expires after 11/15. The $300 rebate deal for a trade-in continues for a while.\nOnce you've done the deal, you can pay off the remainder owed on the phones over 2 years - or pay them off in a lump sum, keeping the newly added lines for only 30 days.", "time": "11-14-2015 09:59 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4832383", "text": "I got the $300 credit on this one from Best Buy last night (Friday, November 13, 2015):TRACFONE - Alcatel Onetouch Pixi GLITZ No-Contract Cell Phone - BlackLooks like I was lucky then; see my comment above.

This is the main reason behind Why Task Killers Are Useless\nI have much experience changing the suffix of the apks via root explorer to remove bloat, as I have with my OG Droid, Droid X and various other Verizon phones that my friends had.

I'm trying hard not to put the TURBO 2 (or Moto X Force) too far behind the X Style because the specs are right up there and it even has some perks like wireless charging.

I'm talking about what the market will bear, and general cost per specs, and it feels like you're talking about how it would need to be priced to get *you* to consider buying it. \nA lot of the things we have to consider when buying are subjective (what's the value of fast updates? what's the value of wireless charging?). For one buyer, a feature, spec, or characteristic may be a deal breaker. For example, the Droid Maxx early on didn't support the Square payment reader. As a small business owner using Square, I couldn't justify buying a phone that didn't support square. The specs and price could be worlds better than anything else on the market, but if it doesn't meet the owners needs (or very strong wants), it doesn't matter. One person may be willing to pay an extra $100 for something like wireless charging. Another buyer won't use it, couldn't care less, and doesn't way to pay one penny extra. As we've seen in this forum, some care about small styling details (like logo placement), while others couldn't care less.\nIt sounds like you de-value the phone a fair amount for the perceived likelihood of slow & fewer updates (which I agree is likely, and very fair to consider). You de-value it further for its bloatware (though I think to be fair, most or all of the bloatware can be disabled or removed, but it's still there & fair to consider.) \nIt also sounds like you don't add much value for the shatterproof screen. I'm guessing you have a history of taking good care of your phones, so it's not a major concern (same goes for me, though it would be a little comforting). I'd bet money that if Apple made shatterproof versions of the iPhone and charged an extra $200 for them, they'd sell like hotcakes. For a lot of people, that's a feature that is very valuable, and could alone justify the price difference between the Turbo2 and other offerings.\nI can totally understand your reasons for the Turbo2 being down a little bit on your list. I'm just not convinced that your reasons translate into \"it would make the most business sense for Motorola/Verizon to price the Turbo2 substantially lower.\" I think they'll have great sales as-is. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a small drop in price after the new year, or sometime when a new competitor launches, but I think (especially with the trade-in offers, etc) that they'll sell fine for now without a price drop.", "time": "11-04-2015 02:55 PM", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post4804483", "text": "I read somewhere, not long ago, that Motorola is not including some of the Moto apps in Marshmallow because of duplication of ideas.

I know the Turbo and Maxx are similar and have the biggest batteries but maybe the Pure will be good enough. Coming from the Moto X 2013 almost anything will be better.

I'll try one more time and then happily stop useless back n forth (ppl do that a lot these days).\nA manufacturer can put logos on their product all they want. In fact, anything can be done. Point is that they want to actually SELL said product right? You may buy it but others like me won't. So they will lose some people, others not. So the message conveyed is very important! I don't care what contracts are made on who \"has permission\" to do what. You're trying to sell the product to ME, to YOU, to others! So this is not a \"look what I can do since I have all the control.\" This is about the care one should take to make the right selling choices, aka BUSINESS choices.\nA manufacturers logo is different from a \"carrier\" logo. So you can say it is a collaboration btwn VZW and Motorola, this is true! It still doesn't change the point that it installs a lack of confidence on the part of the carrier, it shows a desire to \"control\" the message we see in our minds, and it's still at the end of the day, A MOTOROLA FIRST product. A car logo is the logo of the manufacturer. And even Toyota, or Honda, or any car company, they always take great care on what that logo will look like. You won't see a Toyota spell its name on the front. You'll see a \"symbol.\" Why? Consumers will not buy an advertisement on wheels. So care is taken to make sure that even a manufacturer places the right logo for the product they want to sell.\nThat alteration that Motorola did in their redesign cost them $$$. And that is partly why the iPhone is so valued and no phone OEM can never go head to head with them. Samsung has come the closest but still doesn't have the power of Apple. And that's unfortunate because android is a great operating system and ecosystem.\nSo the bottom line is that, if a company wants to stand out, it needs to consider its power of influence. When you see an iPhone with no VZW logo, no VZW bloatware, that speaks volumes! \nMotorola is linked to VZW.

It sounds like it still struggles with low light shots, as cell phone cameras generally do.", "time": "07-28-2015 09:41 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4577874", "text": "If the camera can beat the note 5,s6,and g4 in low light motion then I would get it.", "time": "07-28-2015 10:27 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4577927", "text": "I think that will be a very high bar to achieve, but we'll see.
