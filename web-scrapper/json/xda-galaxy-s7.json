We simply got tired of carrying around the behemoth phablet so we were looking to downsize to either S7 Edge or the S7, Verizon offered BOGO deal with both our Note 4 trade in, they also gave us two free Samsung S2 watch ($350 retail each), extra $100 visa credit per line, and more data for less (16GB for $80 vs 15GB for $100 from ATT), can also claim the free VR gear from samsung, too good of a deal to past up!  LOL  I heard the Edge screen is super sensitive (saw quite a few complaints on S7 Edge forum) and there's no getting around it yet, and some people had the curve screen scratch too easily.  After playing around with both phones at the store we found the Edge wasn't much of a downsize anyway but the S7 is just perfect.   \n\nPerformance:\nThe camera from S7 is leap and bound above the Note 4, it focus instantly, it is significantly more responsive than our Note 4, which had some focusing bugs issues, the Note 4 simply would not focus until we shoke the phones a few times, I've went through two new Note 4 with the same focusing problem, odin new rom or factory reset did not help either, it happened on 4.4 Kitkat and 5.01 Lolipop so it seems like a hardware issue.  Overall we love our new S7, it feels much more responsive navigating and opening multiple apps, didn't notice lag like we often do with Note 4, no delay in keyboard.  Battery life seems fine to us, it last us all day so no complaint there, though the phone does run warmer than Note 4, during charge or heavy usage in cpu/gpu intensive apps or games.  Usually we upgrade our phones in 2 years cycle so the non-removable battery never bothers us at all, we have never needed to replace the battery on Note 2 or Note 4.\n\nCase:\nWe bought several different cases for the S7, the $20 VRS Design High Pro shield feels cheap and the shell is too thin and inadequate to protect from drop, volume and power buttons are free floating and clicky, they are easily fell off as well.  2nd one we ried was the $40 Otterbox Defender, unfortunately the built-in screen protector on both unit we bought have too much gap and don't sit flush to the screen, the buttons for volume and power are extremely stiff and hard to press in, for whatever reason Otterbox mess this one up for the S7, this is a complete garbage comparing to the Defender we had on our Note 4, won't even pay $20 for this junk so we returned it.   3rd one we tried was the SUPCASE Full-body Rugged Holster Case with Built-in Screen Protector for $18, it is slightly slimmer than the Otterbox Defender but fits like a glove, the screen protector sits flush to the screen with zero gap or rainbow effect, my wife can't even tell there's a screen protector in place, volume and power buttons are responsive and easy to press, overall the SUPCASE feel as rugged as the defender from our Note 4, it is what the S7 Defender should have been.  I would gladly pay $40 for it, feels like I ripped them off for paying only $18 from Amazon.

We hear that every year but this year you really believed it  It's technically impossible to get DSLR qualities like great bokeh and real low light capabilities. Why: sensor size.

De sony a7s has the same pixel count (12mp) as the imx260/isocell but has a much greater area to catch light. Therefore the a7s can take pictures with higher iso's without too much loss in colour or gains in noise (). With my sony a7 I have 24mp but up too iso6400 I have almost no noise. Try the same iso with the imx260 and you get one big noise picture (or iso800). \n\r\nBokeh or out of focus quality can be achieved with a couple of tricks (like close focus and far backgrounds) But DSLR/mirrorless capabilities not so much.. they have to use tricks and processes like the huawei p9 or post processing like the s7 does. Why: simple physics\n\r\nPicture quality in good light: It can be as good as a DSLR/mirrorless but only if they have cheap 'stock' lensen or crappy sensor. Details and colours are always better on a leica (~2000+usd) or zeiss (~1000+USD) lenses even on a cheap DSLR with a crop sensor or even a 1\" sensor. \r\nVisual size comparison:\n\n\r\nComing from the Lumia 950xl and using fullframe sensor camera with good optics, I'm loving what I'm seeing on the S7 edge.

The one with SD805 and the IMX240 (same sensor powering Note 4). Recently, due to an accident which resulted in destroying my S5+, I bought an S7 (Exynos version...and quite possibly an ISOcell sensor or whatever Sammy calls it these days) I don't think I ve got the IMX260 powering my unit, so I can't make any comments regarding the hardware...\nOS wise - it was 4.4.4 and 6.0.1 on my S5+ and Android N (pre-installed) on my S7.\n\nSince I am a hardcore video shooter with my phone, I can share my impressions of the S7. In short, I was rather disappointed.\n\nVideo rec modes remain the same for both i.e. 4K, 1080p 30/60, 720p...don't care\nI was expecting similar output (if not better) from my S7 compared to my S5+. But no. After triple-checking on the camera/video/photo settings, I was still recording videos where compression artifacts are clearly visible. Usually in darker areas (but not always the case) - sometimes even in areas that you d believe the camera is focusing on. I m not saying that this is a sensor issue, but rather more of a post-processing / compression issue. If I freeze the video at certain parts, I can see in a frame, compression artifacts such as the ones you d get from a highly-compressed JPEG. Which makes me wonder why didn't I see any of those whilst I was checking on the video quality produced by the S7, compared to other flagship models.\n\nI am not sure if that quality drop between the two flagships is justified by the fact Samsung decided to move from 16MP -> 12MP, or the software i.e. Nougat vs Marshmallow (...or both). For all I know, frame quality under video recording, has significantly dropped in the S7, compared to the much older S5+. (don't know what the case was for S6, never actually tested it...) Just to clarify - this is definately not a stabilization issue (phone position is fixed whilst shooting).\n\nThe good parts - obviously - the S7 is very good under low light conditions (both video rec and photo shoting). Focus and photo shooting is amazingly fast. Two areas that it clearly smokes the S5+ as far as the camera is concerned. But that's about it really. And I d rather have the 'slower' S5+, rather than the heavily grained videos the S7 produces. Being able to shot better in the dark is always a bonus, but not so important to me. I m usually shooting 1080@30. Sometimes 4K, but under good light only (due to lack of HDR whilst at 2160p). 1080@60 video shooting quality seems like a 'tie' between the S7 / S5+. Both very smooth and similar amount of details preserved in the video. But yet again, I m not shooting high-speed moving objects so as to justify shooting at 60fps. But I m expecting better quality per-frame whilst at 30fps. And at 30fps, the S5+ produces better results.\n\nAlso, the video trimmer under S7/Nougat seems to lack the Rotate feature. Don't know if it was moved under the Movie Maker app (which I haven't yet downloaded). Video processing seems to be much slower now. Trimming under 4.4.4 was at least twice as fast compared to what it is now! I am really curious if trimming under more recent versions of Android actually re-compresses the output file. If that's the case, that would be discraseful to say the least...can anyone confirm this? I will at some point test this myself and post the results.\n\nJust to clarify. I m not saying that recorded videos using the S7 are bad - I m saying that it lacks the quality per-frame of the ones shot by the S5. I very rarely recall seeing compression artifacts in videos captured by my older S5+ and that is why is pretty obvious to me now. And I can't explain it. If it's not a sensor issue, could it be that the compression ratio has been increased? If that's the case - it's a good thing - as it could be fixed in a later release. Has anyone witnessed video quality degredation from Marshmallow ->> Nougat?\n\nPlease share your thoughts.", "time": "12th July 2017, 12:42 PM", "postID": "post72999514", "replies": []}, {"text": "Having tested camera/video more thoroughly, I can confirm that the video trimmer app, actually re-processes output video (re-compressing), which inevibly results in significant quality deterioration.\n\nSay you have a 10min video, and you just want to keep 20secs of it, you ll have to trim x2 times (as there is a minimum output of X seconds, especially if you only need few seconds of footage from larger file).\nWhich means that the quality you ll get in the final crop is less than inferior, considering that the initial video had to be recompressed twice.\nWhich I think, it really is a disgrace :/\nIt seems to me that Samsung had to comply with the youth generation who only want to quickly post a video on YT, putting any quality considerations aside.\n\nStill image quality remains more less the same to the S5+. With the added benefit of the Pro Mode. But as a video shooter, the S7 is easily blown by the much older S5+.

If I had sent it in and used insurance, there was a chance chance it would be swapped out for a refurbished unit without even checking if it was the battery.   Sounded fine until rep told me it would be $150 if phone was damaged.  Unlucky for me, I cracked the back Glass the 1st day i had it.  After, reading many posts, i was 80-90% convinced it would be fixed with with new battery.  This was just enough doubt to keep me from spending 80 bucks for a pro to replace battery.  If financial situation had been better, I would have opted for one of these 2 options.  \n\r\nEnded up costing about $25 bucks and a few hours time...much of which was spent watching YouTube tutorials.  Before discovering this forum, I considered myself pretty tech savvy.  But I am far from it, unless comparing to peers.  I did spend a few years dealing craps, so I can say I have good hands...this was definitely a plus!  All worked great.  \n\r\nAbout 6 weeks later, I dropped phone, which I have done many times.  After initial crack, I bought a heavy duty case which served me very well.  However, when I picked it up, it was dead.  I figured I just needed to plug it in and start it up.  When I did, the battery icon would flash off every couple seconds and vibrate.  I suspected that the connector from battery to board had come loose and needed to be reseated.  Opened it back up and it didn't work.  Tried every button combo and was able to get into download mode and but could not do it when connected to conputer.  Inshould add that phone is not rooted.  I got into recovery mode but could not boot, so i ended up trying a factory reset.   Now the phone shows \"recovery booting\" in small blue letters and keeps flashing and vibrating...just like it had initially done with the battery icon.  I could and can still get into download mode when connected to wall charger, but no luck with computer.  \n\r\nIn a lsst ditch effort,  i completely disassembled and detached wire from power button mechanism.  I was convinced that it was \"stuck\" (even though button did not physically seem stuck), and it seemed to make a lot of sense as to why phone could not charge or boot.   That didnt work so i took out the mechanism, hoping that the wire was for something else....nope, lol. \n\r\nSorry for the novel.  If you are still with me, I have a question.  When receiving an OTA update on my old S5, which I activated, I saw the familiar blue \"recovery booting\" at the beginning of process.   This is likely foolish thinking, but I wondered whether an OTA update that i had been delaying from Verizon, had been forced on my S7 when I did the factory reset and somehow could be playing a part in my misery. \n\r\nFINALLY, my question...could this ever be the case?  And more importantly, would it be possible to have a VZ tech  push some sort of fix to my phone if I can get it into download mode?  I apologize if this is a dumb question and realize that I can certainly call tech support and ask, but figured it would be helpful to know the answer, beforehand.  \n\r\nIf anyone has read this far and lives in, or visits, Minnesota, I will gladly buy you a few rounds for your patience!  \n\r\nP.S.

I have the Gold Platinum Galaxy S7 (not Edge). It is THE sexiest phone I have ever owned. Ever. I was very leery about buying it since it can't be rooted and I've rooted every single Android phone since the Droid, rocking Android 2.0.1, which I bought the day it was released. Though root didn't exist, and I had no idea what root even was for probably a couple months. Basically I screwed with the phone and set everything up that could be possibly customized on my own. At which point I was bored at work and discovered root while looking up what else could be customized that I didn't discover on my own playing with the phone. I was one of the 2% on VZW who had their 3G data throttled back by 90%. So I was also one of the first with 4G, getting a Thunderbolt, rather than waiting for the Bionic (luckily because that was delayed for so long, I was almost due for a new upgrade). But back to the point from my ADDetour, I barely mind not having root. I do wish I could customize the statusbar icons/text/clock colors/fonts. But otherwise loving marshmallow. And I've always liked touchwiz. And love this one. But that's only half of it. This is the first time I can say in terms of hardware that Android crushes Apple. It is one drop dead sexy phone. Though damn near every flagship Android looks better than the iPhone now. I even owned a few iPhones over the years, trying to accept them because I've always thought they were great devices, but none lasted more than a couple weeks before I sold em off and got a new Android. Even though I thought it looked better physically, and I always jailbroke them and tried to make myself like it, I always came right back to Android. As I said in my thread about getting a case for it. I want as little as possible. I have always just slapped a case on my Androids without a second thought. But I don't wanna cover this beauty up.

To me, the S4 has the better materials & form factor. I think the S7 has the best looking design I've ever seen in a phone, but this doesn't really matter to me, and the fragile glass back and dent-prone metal frame demand a case, made even more important by the slipperiness of the back glass and the curved rear edges. The curved edges feel slightly more comfortable on my fingertips, but offer decreased grip. The rear corners (where the curved edges taper to full width at the top and bottom) dig into my hand a bit - not horribly bad, but less comfortable than the S4. The substantial weight increase also adds a bit to the poorer handling of the S7. I never used an S4 case in 3 years, but the gorgeous S7 design requires a case, defeating the whole purpose of that beautiful design. A case adds unwanted physical size to the phone. The good battery life I'm getting and the excellent charging speeds have made losing removable battery fairly easy to swallow, although I'd still prefer removable. I much prefer having the headphone jack on top, although this is more of personal preference.\n\nOn the plus side, I like the S7's all-black home button.
