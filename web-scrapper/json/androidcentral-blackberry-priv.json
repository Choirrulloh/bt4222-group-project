And I have loved them all. BlackBerry 10 was also my favourite OS for a long, long time. \nI decided to delve in to Android straight away when the PRIV got released after it became apparent that resources in to BB10 were being cutback. \nI have loved my PRIV and I feel like purchasing it has been the right decision but I also don't think BlackBerry actually gets it anymore what consumers actually want.\nYes, I really do value my security and that had been one of the main reasons why I have stuck by them. BlackBerry's commitment to maintain the PRIV for its entire lifetime was welcome and nice to hear.\nBut Google has moved Android a lot and has really taken a firm grip on security issues. They started the Android Security Bulletin meaning all Google phones were updated regularly every calender month. BlackBerry obviously was always just behind them as well.\nBut I really can't see myself falling in love with the future BlackBerry devices. PRIV was a flagship but already it's falling apart in my view. I have really bad issues with charging now. This only started roughly about June. Basically every Micro USB cable I buy doesn't last very long at all making me to decide I really need a USB C phone pronto.\nBecause of this, I feel like I have been paying flagship prices for devices that do not last the distance. \nI've been really excited by the Google Keynote launch and really am in awe of the Pixel. Basically the Pixel is the same price of my PRIV when I bought it when it was released in November. And I feel like I could do a lot more things and get a lot more out of it.\nYes I will miss the HUB, yes I will miss the BlackBerry keyboard but I really think this is an end of an era for BlackBerry and me. Who knows, maybe I will change my mind in a year because I can't justify buying another flagship phone. In all honesty I do hope I win a Pixel competition so I can do away with the frustrating quirks my PRIV keeps giving me a lot sooner than I hope.\nIt can also be extremely frustrating how I can no longer type while I try and charge my PRIV at the same time. Mayb it's a software issue that has never been fixed. Maybe it's just the hardware breaking. Either way I do not expect any flagship devices to cause me frustrations.

It's all subjective indeed though, but as an android device, all in all the Priv checks off enough boxes for must have features that I don't worry recommending the unit to most, although not everyone needs these additional features. \nOne annoyance of the Priv for me is the lack of a fingerprint reader. I've gotten so used to it on the iPad (especially now since apps are using it too) that it feels pretty weird to have to manually type in a password, minor gripe though. \nAnyway, I'd say if the price is right, go for it.

Is it possible?", "thread": [{"postID": "post5672551", "text": "I am recent migrant to Android. I used to use a BlackBerry Z10 (BB10 OS) and *loved* it but my new company won't support it, so I am back to Android land for the first time since 2.x. My new device is a BlackBerry Priv. It runs Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow) and uses (mostly) the stock UI with a few BBRY improvements around messaging and some other things.\nI miss a few specific things about my BB10 experience, and hoping to re-create them on Android, if possible. Specifically:\n1) Bedside mode. On BB10, there is a \"bedside mode\" that suppresses all notifications *except* telephone calls, and it ensures that the phone actually rings loudly. I can get close to this with Android's \"do not disturb\" function, but if I have my phone on vibrate (which I usually do), the ringer is still silenced (vibrate only) when in \"do not disturb mode\" - meaning that it won't wake me up when I am on-call unless I remember to crank up the volume before I go to bed.\n--> Is there a way to replicate the BB10-style behavior on Android?\n2) Lock screen. I actually really like the lock screen on both Android and BB10. On BB10, the lock screen is shown after waking up the display - even if the phone isn't locked. I would love to get this same behavior in Android. I have a 10-minute lockout on my phone, but if I wake the display with either power button or double-tap, I am returned to the previous view.\n--> Is there a way to have the display wake-up view default to the lock screen, even if the phone isn't locked?\n3) Power button. One thing I hate about the Priv (and this is *not* an Android problem - it is bad hardware design) is that the power button is along the left edge. This is a problem because when I holster the device, the power button can easily toggle and when I go to retrieve my phone, I find it asking for my boot password. Obviously, I can flip the orientation when holstered, but is there any way to *require* approval to shut down when the power button is held, unless it is held for a ludicrously long time like 60 seconds?\nThanks, everyone for taking the time.

I love almost everything about the Priv. \nI don't ever do any type of reviews of anything, so I thought I would just write a few impressions of mine, and why from an Android user perspective I don't feel as if it is more productive for me. I want to preface this post by saying that I am sure that the Hub on BB10 blows this out of the water with the way it is integrated into the entire OS. I truly wanted to give all of the Blackberry software a fair shake, and I feel 5 days or so is enough for me to write my opinions.\nI think the main reason why many BB10 converts want/need to use the Hub because it is what they are familiar with. The idea is great. Have all your social media messages/emails in one spot that you can access in one place. The issue I have is, as an Android user, that place is my notification shade. I found that I have no need to go to the Hub to check all my messages when I always naturally check them, dismiss them, archive them, delete them, etc from my notification tray. \nNow, if there would be a way that they could figure out a way to send texts, do things with social media, and everything from within the app, this could change my view of it. However in Android, it just doesn't work that way. The Hub is just an app, and one that doesn't do anything better than my Gmail/Messenger/Phone app. \nThese are the things that bothered me and is the reason why I am probably going to go back to using my old Android apps. \n-The inability to archive Gmail emails.\n-When I delete a message from the lockscreen it automatically unlocks my phone. \n-When I file an email to a different folder, it stays in the hub. I have to filter out unread emails to get it off of there.\n-When I delete a text message in the Hub, it deletes in my main app too. I tried checking delete on Hub only, but it still does this. I just want to dismiss the message out of my hub.\n-To delete an email from my Android Wear watch, I have to swipe to the right three times. Would love to be like Gmail where it is one swipe then delete.\nBottom line, the Hub is fantastic on BB10 I am sure, but this is Android. What makes it great on BB10 is having everything accessible in one place, but Android already has that built in. A majority of people that get notifications deal with them when they check their phone through the notification tray. No need to open an app to dismiss it there. Feels redundant. I honestly will keep the hub active so that I can see a timeline of my texts and phone calls in one place, but I think I will be moving back to the Gmail app. The great thing is, in Android its ok. Android is about choice. You don't like what's on your phone, you have the choice to go find a better solution. I know it's different, but if Android is new to you, just give it time and you will enjoy the ability to choose as well.\nPosted via the Android Central App on the Priv.", "time": "11-17-2015 11:31 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4870446", "text": "I quit using Hub.

I use this phone a lot and I think priv is excellent buy even with all other new phones with better specs that are available now. \nBlackberry android os has improved significantly since I owned the phone.\n1. Blackberry has added many more popular apps to hub like instagram or pinterest. \n2. Blackberry priv battery has improved tremendously since marshmallow update. I get easily a day of work out of the phone. The phone does not get hot anymore. I bought rapid charger for the phone and together with it I never think if battery will run out of juice. \n3. Blackberry keyboards have improved a lot. Swipe gestures work better on physical keyboard and blackberry added more features to blackberry virtual keyboard. Blackberry virtual keyboard is the most comprehensive keyboard App in google playstore. \n4. Blackberry camera has improved as well. It offers a lot of options to take photos. This does not help hardware though. I find blackberry camera to be good (adequate) but not the best\n5. Blackberry launcher has improved. I do not use it much myself. I got nova launcher months ago and I use it exclusively. I find blackberry launcher to be OK but with needs more improvement. Blackberry should add swipe functions and bake in the hub to have more of bb10 feel to it. \n6. Slide mechanism is solid. I never had problems with it. Not even once\n7. Built quality is good but I find slight flex of back cover annoying. My understanding is that newer blackberry priv builds do not have this problem. \n8. I use priv mostly for work and messaging but I use phone for gaming from time to time. I find that phone handles most popular games well. Air Attack 2 runs great. So is angry birds 2 and other games. Games like world of tanks blitz run ok on the phone with minimum settings. \n9. Phone reception is excellent. \n10. Blackberry speaker is very good. I use it a lot and I find it to be loud and clear. \n11. Blackberry keeps it's promise of releasing monthly blackberry security updates \nOverall I am very happy with priv and I do not have slight desire to get any other phone. Priv is excellent buy even compared to latest android phones. I would recommend buying phone directly from blackberry especially if you are in USA. This will ensure that you get all updates in time with no delay.

I found the auto correct frustrating on the blackberry one and the swipe accuracy not very good. Overall I prefer the google one and the customization options. Anyways..\nWhen used in conjunction with the physical keyboard, I now seem to be having issues with the physical keyboard. For example, if i want to type out an email address with my physical keyboard, \"blablabla@gmail.com\", when i hit the alt key and then the letter \"P\", so i can select the @ symbol, it just types the letter P instead of the @ symbol. Same thing for any secondary key options. If i hit alt N to try and hit a comma, it will just type the letter N. Basically my ALT key isn't working properly since having the google keyboard installed and in use. Before the alt key used to trigger emojis when being used with the google keyboard, but I've since turned that off in google keyboard settings. Now theres no emojis popping up when i hit ALT, but there is also no word suggestions at all appearing when I type with the physical keyboard. Pretty frustrating!

I came from the Z30; love that phone. \nAfter unboxing and updating to Marshmallow I began looking for apps that would meet my needs. And this is where things got interesting. Apps are a blessing and frustration. Although I knew I wouldn\u2019t get the BB10 experience, I wanted the same or better functionality. Should be easy, right? Not so much. So, much, choice. Who is the developer? Do they datamine? Can the they be trusted? Does the app do what I want? In short, whereas BB10 works well and is integrated right out of the box, it took me a couple of days to find apps I liked for the Priv. \nMy Priv has never really gotten hot like I hear from others, with the exception of when I updated to Marshmallow. I use the Hub and have 6 email accounts in it, as well as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, BBM and text messages. The Hub has been good for me. No lag. The phone is well built. The pkb is fairly clicky. The screen is gorgeous. I have the wireless charging model using the BlackBerry flip case and I have no squishy back. The screen does seem a bit loose on the bottom when extended and you tap it, but nothing that worries me. Battery life has been fine. Gets me through the day into the evening. I rarely charge the phone after unplugging when I get up. But my use is probably different than your use. \nGestures is still a bit of a challenge. I still find myself swiping when I should be tapping. But that\u2019s only because of motor memory. That being said, sometimes it feels like it is a bit quicker to do things on BB10, but we're talking a second here and there. \nNotifications is a bit of a challenge. I still haven\u2019t found a way to assign a sound to my daughter\u2019s bbm messages that is different from other bbms, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an app for that (see above regarding apps). I do like the notification drawer at the top. It is a quick way to see what\u2019s new.\nDespite apps being a frustration, it is nice having apps that work fully and quickly. No sideloading, no removing gps and nice to have updated features. For example, I typed this in Word for Android; I really like the features in this app. And I like that you control permissions. \nI\u2019ve been a vkb aficionado but I\u2019m liking this pkb more and more. It definitely takes some getting used to. I keep missing the spacebar for example. I really like the scrolling feature.\nI bought the Priv because of BlackBerry\u2019s hardening of Android (I wasn\u2019t really prepared to look at other Androids) and because of the apps. Apps that have updated features. Apps that work. But the Android OS does not flow as nicely as BB10 and it is missing some of the very useful useful BB10 features. BlackBerry really built a nice OS. My ideal would be BB10 with the fully functioning app ecosystem of Android but that will never happen. In the end, I can do with my Priv what could do with my Z30, but in a different way. And I have the apps. I think this is a good direction for BlackBerry. \nCross posting to CB\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "07-30-2016 12:19 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5290297", "text": "Yep is a great phone I love mine.

In my own opinion, I think it is the best of both worlds. Google Play has a plethora of apps and you should be able to find the equivalent (or better version) of your apps in there. \nAs far as hardware issues, every case and every individual phone is different: what is true for some users may not be true for you. But I get your worry: with the slide-out keyboard - though it's an AMAZING feature - there is definitely room for breaks and malfunctioning. But when you buy any device, you're always taking a risk that it may be easily broken or damaged. But BlackBerry is a special case because of the platform itself. \nChen said somewhere a while back that BB would be sticking to at least software if they do not make a sizable comeback in the near future (if I misquoted him/things have changed since then, I apologize - feel free to correct me! But I'm almost positive I read this somewhere on the forums here or on CrackBerry). And when you buy a phone on a contract basis, the company is obligated to give you at least your contract's worth of OS support, updates, troubleshooting, etc. If BlackBerry does go under or the company has more trouble, it is not as if your phone will just stop working. And even if something happens that you keep it for a long time and they stop putting out updates, your phone will still work - you just won't get any more software updates, etc. \nAll in all, the choice is yours and you should research the Priv and try it out for yourself to see if it really meets your needs. Actually, I would really suggest hopping on over to CrackBerry, as those forums are specially tailored to BB products and there are BB experts who can also assist you if you have any questions.

On AT&T's network, the Priv delivers very loud maximum speakerphone and earpiece volume with zero distortion or wobble. General transmissions through the mic are also very clear. Noise cancellation took care of strong background noise, but there was some computerization of my voice when it had to deal with it. The speakerphone also transmits well, although some wind noise came through. As a giant slab to make voice calls on, the Priv is top-notch.\nI'm also happy that the Priv's cellular radio takes best advantage of both the AT&T and T-Mobile networks. It has quad-band GSM, five-band HSPA+ (including 1700MHz), and LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/6/12/17/20/29/30. That includes every band AT&T and T-Mobile currently use, every band used by Canadian carriers, and the most popular international roaming bands. Reception on AT&T's network was excellent.

( I finally have all apps I want and I use google maps). \nWhat I like \nBattery - it is OK. Sometimes it is better than other days but with rapid charger I hardly pay attention because charging is very fast\nCamera - it is good. Much better than what I ever had on any blackberry but not the best out there \nBlackberry hub - I like it but it is not as good as bb10 one. I use it all the time and i am looking forward to feature updates. \nPlastic -casing I wish blackberry would come out with priv silver edition. I would buy it in no time. Plastic priv is OK but silver priv would be so sweet ( or red one !) \nWhat I dislike\nBlackberry is slow with updates (except for security). I want to see more ui and especially hub updates. Blackberry is extra slow hear. The only explanation I have is that blackberry is working hard on marshmallow and hub will be \"baked into\" os like on bb10 with swipe features etc. \nBlackberry productivity bar should incorporate other popular programs. \nI've been using nova launcher for a while now and I love it. I might go back to blackberry launcher once marshmallow update is out. \nGame performance in world of tanks. Games run fine on priv but world of tanks just so so. I guess this has more to do with Android. I can comfortably play this game on low settings but my 2 year old ipad runs same game on high settings. Other popular games like cut the rope or angry birds or alto adventure run smooth on priv. \nOverall priv is one awesome phone. If I had to make choice again today I would still buy this phone.

I am using my brother's Blackberry Priv. I have always been, and will be, a Blackberry person.\nIn the few days I've been using this phone, three of my biggest dislikes are (1) the size of the device (feels like an iPhone 6+); (2) the battery life. I was at the hospital visiting my Dad and the battery was at 80% at 11:30 AM; by 4:30 PM and with moderate use (email, gaming, & a few phone calls) the phone was completely dead; and (3) the phone seems to overheat.\nThe positives of the phone is (1) the physical keyboard being available, if needed; (2) gaming; and (3) integration of Android/Google & Blackberry OS on the device. \nIMHO, everything runs smoothly.\nPosted via Android Central App", "time": "03-30-2016 01:37 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5094454", "text": "Nope, I'm returning my wife's Priv before the 14 day return period is up.\nMy wife had the Bold back in the day and she really liked that phone with the physical keyboard but after that she always had android phones with on-screen keyboards. So when the Priv came out I suggested that the get it... she was really excited about this phone and really wanted to like it. Well after a week with it here's our impressions.\nPros:\n- Excellent call quality, far better than the Note 3 she had.\n- Great signal strength\n- Great screen visual quality\n- Camera photo quality is definitely better than her Note 3 (although I don't think it's any better than my Nexus 6P)\n- Front facing speakers\n- Sleek and nice looking design with the slide out keyboard. You'd never know physical keyboard is there unless someone showed you.\n- Battery life is OK\nCons:\n- Touch screen has issues in one of the games she plays that uses a virtual joystick, the touch screen doesn't track the virtual joystick movements very well. (this game worked as it should on her almost 3 year old Note 3)\n- The curved screen interferes with on-screen keyboards and some games. Since the screen curves around the side of the device there are times you have to interact with this area of the screen, this can be difficult to do on this curve especially if you have a case on the phone.\n- The physical keyboard is integrated with the on-screen keyboard so if you try to use a 3rd party keyboard some functions on the physical keyboard don't work as they should... one example is the symbol key doesn't work the way it should with a 3rd party keyboard. Both my wife and I don't like the BB on-screen keyboard for several reasons and would much rather use the SwiftKey keyboard. Since she uses the on-screen keyboard more than the physical keyboard (probably about 70/30) that needs to be the focus and she needs to have the keyboard she likes.\n- On the physical keyboard some dedicated keys are missing that we think should be there... the period key needs to be it's own key, and not under an alt function. And my wife prefers to have a number row. I believe with the height of the phone they could have got another row of keys on the physical keyboard... but if this really wasn't possible, at the very least there should have been an option to turn a number row on on the on-screen keyboard, especially with the issues of using 3rd party keyboards.\n- The MicroUSB port is very difficult to plug a cable into on my wife's Priv... you have to wiggle the end of the cable around at different angles until it will go in without damaging anything. (this is probably a manufacture defect, but with all the other things she don't like it's just going back)\n- This phone gets hotter than it should I think... my 6P with the 810 processor rarely gets hot and this Priv with the 808 gets hot all the time... something doesn't seem right here?\n- This phone charges slow even with the stock charger.\n- Price... it's my opinion that this phone is over priced for the hardware you get inside. Seems to me they're trying to justify the price by their name and the physical keyboard. Now if this phone didn't have these cons and work a lot better for my wife we could have justified this price... but this phone is not as polished as it should be at this price point with this hardware in my opinion.", "time": "03-30-2016 09:42 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5097858", "text": "I would.

I tried to charge it, and when it was on wireless charging just sitting there, the phone was using more battery than it could charge. When I put it on the Quickcharge 2.0 charger, it wouldn't charge above 68%. I have tried all kinds of battery apps to diagnose the problem, but all it says is that the Android system, Android OS, and Google Services are all the culprit. The phone never goes into \"deep sleep\", even when I purposefully set the phone down and don't touch it. I have deleted any app I've downloaded in the past month and nothing seems to work. Something on the phone has triggered it and I am afraid the only way to correct it is another factory reset, but that is ridiculous to think I have to factory reset this thing every few months. \nI'm closer to a power user than I am casual, so I don't expect to get exceptional battery life, but it is very evident that this change happened immediately two days ago. I know the Priv does tend to get hot, but for me that is only when it is being used. Since two days ago this thing stays hot, like the cpu is being maxed out all the time. I am attaching some pictures showing my battery stats. I do not agree with the standard battery, because it says the screen is the top offender at 5%, when the phone is already down to 50% and the screen on time is less than a half hour.

So that was not a surprise.\nThe same could be said for software. But, I thought it would be all relative. Because smartphones are vaguely similar.\nI couldn't have been more wrong.\nHere's what I miss about BB10 and dislike:\nBedside mode: An all in one built in app, that's not really an app per-say. There is no icon to click that would open an app.It's more along the line of a switch.\nOnce in that mode, you can select settings on what you want to come through,schedule multiple alarms with different tones that can happen on different days and times.\nAlong with what will come through for notifications,calls etc..\nIt's something, that I don't think can be fully duplicated in the ease of it on BB10 to Android.\nI've done it by setting the priority setting and using an app called Glimmer. An app that I actually really like. But finding that, took multiple downloads of other apps. Glimmer was about the 5th app.\nRemote access: Done through the built in file manager. I access my home PC and whichever folders/drives I give it permission to. I've used this multiple times while at work or a friends house or out on the road. Have a file at home on the PC and need it, no problem I have it in moments. And, it is fantastically easy to setup. \nAlong with remote access in the file manager, access to box and drop box is natively built in. So I can copy and paste from my pc to my device,sd card,box or drop box in moments.\nSound profiles: I know Android has 3 built in. Do not disturb,Priority and normal. While its there, its lacking and basic. On BB10 you have normal, phone calls only,vibrate only,silent,meeting mode and bedside.\nEach can be set to different parameters for basic notifications and even how each individual app responds. And switching between profiles is a breeze. Literally seconds,if that.\nThe Hub: I know, I know, The Priv has it yes. But, its a bastardized version of it.\nOn BB10, you get pretty much everything through it. For instance, on my personal BlackBerry Passport, here are the apps that go through my hub:\nHub: all accounts in 1 stream\nPriority hub: customizable by flagged/starred/ important conversations\nVisual voicemail\nNotifications: non built for blackberry apps, android apps,sound cloud blackbullet (pushbullet client)\nText messages: Built in, not booted to an external app like the Priv\nInstagram\nFacebook: can respond straight from within hub, without opening app\nDater: Tinder client\n3 email accounts\nTwitter: can respond straight from within hub, without opening app\nLinked In: can respond straight from within hub, without opening app\nFoursquare: can respond straight from within hub, without opening app\nCalls\nEmergency alerts\nPin messages\nBBM\nEach can be viewed separately, instead of all at once.\nContacts:\nOrganized to the T. \nPulls info from any connected app for each individual contact an puts it all in one profile by itself and assigns pictures from their various profiles as there contact picture rather than a blue/grey head. And within each persons profile, You get 3 tabs. \nDetails: Phone numbers, emails, Birthdays (if listed on facebook etc...) Job(if provided on linkedin), Education(If provided on linkedin) and Bio's of connected profiles from apps.\nUpdates: Facebook posts and more\nActivity: What and when you talked to them via text , etc...\nOn the Priv:\n3 emails\nFacebook\nText message : boots to app or hangouts\nBBMEDIT: I did not originally install Twitter or LinkedIn. Once I added these, they too also worked in the hub as they did in BB10\nNow you see why. And I can't blame BlackBerry for doing it this way.\nNo one wants to share, i.e. google, apple, samsung etc..\nSo they need to keep certain things locked down. So they give you a sample on Android to see what its like.\nCustomizable settings menu:\nAndroid has this, but its basic out of the box. Can it be corrected with a new launcher?\nProbably. I have not dove that deep in yet. BB10, can be set to what options you want displayed and then you can organize them as such as in a layout. \nBlackberry Blend:\nAndroid has pushbullet, which is good. So this is almost a break even.\nExcept that blend is built in and not found externally.\nIf you know pushbullet, it works in kinda the same way. I again have just broke the surface with bullet. So like I said break even, pretty much.\nQuality apps:\nIn Blackberry world, they have a designation, Built for Blackberry. Which generally means it meets full measures set by BB and that it is fluid as the OS itself.\nThere are other apps as well in the store that work, but they might be clunky a bit.\nSo this is a way of determining good vs bad rather than just relying on \"reviews\".\n*Apps part Deux:\nBB10 somewhat suffers at this. It has been made easier by a member on crackberry.com, by making BB10 able to run Google play with pretty much full functionality. Problem is, that BlackBerry themselves haven't updated the run time. So if i recall correctly, it's still on kit kat. And there lies the problem, Google updates there apps like crazy. So functionality can be worrisome and unpredictable. So, people generally will either update and have a non-working app and will have to hunt down an apk. Or you get into a method of not updating any app anymore.\nThe dreaded Facebook app. I don't even want to mention it further than that, Besides it being horrible. BlackBerry themselves built it and it feels like its back in the hay-days of before apps were apps. Just about any app that is built entirely by them, is rarely updated.\n*Lack of development:\nWhile I fully appreciate the developers that are constantly developing and updating,\nThere is just not enough of them. And I can understand why more and more leave.\nBlackBerry needs this to happen for BB10 to survive.\nI hated jumping to Android. But we'll see how long that lasts.\n*No wearable's:\nNo need to explain further.\nThe OS itself:\nIt's just fluid smooth and easy. No questions asked on where to go. Not sub menu after sub menu after sub menu. You need it, ok here it is.\nThings I like on the Priv and dislike:\n* The hub: See BB10 part\nWidgets:\nOh the widgets. Blackberry missed out on this big time.\nThey had a somewhat version of it on the old Bolds with OS7 but did't bring it to BB10.\nWTF is that?\nAnyways, widgets. You ask for it, they are provided.\nWith the Priv, they added an extra layer with pop up widgets. This to me, is immensely useful. No opening apps fully just to do 1 thing. Make it quick, make it simple. And they did.\nApps: \nAvailability of pretty much everything. No run around's to make things work. All up to date. \n*Apps part deux:\nQuality and organization of apps is horrid. I've been through numerous apps trying to find one that fits my needs. So much time wasted and money spent and then refunded.\nIt may have Google play with a billion and one apps, but 95% of them are horrid.\nI can't even find a app for the camera that has a manual focus with a slider to adjust.\nFor one of the biggest app markets, that's a bit ridiculous.\nApps that had multiple attempts before finding the right one were about a minimum 5 downloads of each and time hunting:\nClock : style\nAlarm clock : to duplicate bedside mode Daydream is to many menus deep \nMusic player : non-google oriented\nImage gallery : non-google oriented\nCamera : Manual focus not found, honorable mentions , Open camera and silent camera\nWearable's & Gadgets:\nYes, I can get a watch and other gadgets to play nice with the phone. I can participate in Kickstarter stuff and not have to think about if it will fully work or not with my device.EDIT: Using Sony Smartwatch 3. This is a daily use item, and almost kinda is a proper mini BB10 hub feel.Get a notification, \nI see it on the watch and I know if I need to go to my phone or not. Along with audio controls and accepting phone calls if you cant get to te phone in time to pick it up. Reply to text messages, You can do that to. Set reminders and location based reminders,alarms, ask questions with ok google command,play music straight from the watch w/BT headphones and many other features. The one I enjoy most, is an app called Stocard. all my rewards cards are on my phone and watch. No reason to remove my phone from the pocket to scan the bar code.\nAlso, I grabbed a Philips Hue setup. I am a huge fan of this and has since been part of my alarm clock setup in the morning. It works quite well.. As well as a single WEMO switch to turn on my space heater before I get home.\nThe Google app:\nI love this sh!t. I use it on my tablet (Sony Z2 Verizon version) all the time.\nPackages coming in, not having to dig through my email to find it.\nWeather listed\nStock listings\nStuff to read\nBirthdays\nMorning traffic notifications and more....\nThough I have not fully utilized Google now. I'm a bit hesitant on that one.\nCustomization:\nI'm a bit weird and maybe eccentric. I like to fiddle with things of different styles. I can now do this. Clocks styles, icon packs etc...\nApp tray:\nIt's like a universal folder, but you can't really fiddle with it.\nSo, If I folder an app and can't recall where I put it, head to the app tray. I know its there.\nDevelopers:\nThese guys, occasionally take it over the top. There are consistently new things going on with droid. This is a good and a bad. The bad side, is non extensive testing.\n*Battery life:\nIn comparison, its a night and day comparison.\nAndroid is hungry. With just about the same battery size as the Passport, I don't think, actually, I'm kinda positive, that I could not duplicate the same battery life with the Priv.EDIT: Since launch day use, I have got maximum of 1.5 days. But more so a single day. I do have wifi,BT and location on all day as well though. So if I turn those off, I'm pretty sure I could squeeze that 1.5 day stat again.\nProductivity tab:\nI like this, and I think it was a smart move and \"borrow\" from samsung.\nI use it to get access to the hub and calendar and such.\nRather than clicking the icon.EDIT: I have since got rid of the tab in favor of the all in one gestures app to enable swiping for access to the hub and some other apps.\n*Button in the middle of the volume rockers:\nNo ability to change what it does. An overall mute option is a great idea, but a better Idea,would have been to make it programmable.\nComing from BB10, that was the activation of the voice assistant.EDIT: Can supposedly be done by enabling an option in settings. I have not done this, due to the warning that pops up by enabling it.\nNFC Triggers:\nAdmittingly, I did not dabble with this in BB10, but it is very enjoyable and somewhat convenient.Edit: I do not use these that much anymore. Mainly just one. With things like IFTTT, it makes NFC tags borderline useless in my opinion.\nWith just about every tech site praising Android for it's abilities in just about every area, I thought, that Android would be a smooth move.\nAs it turns out, that the ability of Android is great, but it is missing key elements for a \"matured OS\" and having gone through many versions.\nIf you are Pro Google, and used to using only their ecosystem, you will have no difficulty.\nIf you are the latter, and coming from a new OS, be it IOS, Windows or BB10, get ready for a ride.\nIt will seem that I'm heavily bias, but I'm going to do my best after running Android as a daily for only a week.\nAs you go down the list above, here are the solutions I have found thus far, to make a BB10 user feel more complete after leaving their OS to try something new.\nCamera: \nI've went through numerous camera apps to get one thing. And none of them have it. A manual focus. After installing,buying and removing multiple ones, I found the stock loaded BlackBerry camera app the best. The focus system for up close macro shots is just as good as the ones from the few I narrowed down from the Play store.\nI liked Silent camera and Open camera,\nOpen camera would be my second choice due to the layout and the awesome instant take a picture pop up widget.\nMusic: \nAnother app I tried many of.\nBlack player music player, was my player of choice. But I found it lacked things. I cannot recall at this time of writing. The sound, while connected through Bluetooth in my car just seemed dull and flat.\nI went to a trusted app from BB10 and grabbed Neutron player and never looked back.\nSound quality improved greatly in the car alone. No settings were adjusted on Neutron.\nBedside mode: The toughest one to find, next to the camera app. While daydream is loaded on Android and does a half decent job, its no bedside mode.\nMy best found one so far, is called Glimmer. It's simple clean, has an evolving volume and evolving light ( think a sunrise) from a black screen with just a time.\nAnd if you are not awake by the time your alarm is actually set for (which is unlikely due to the ambient sound of choice of setting) you can set a noise/song to play as well.\nThis along with utilizing the options of the priority setting get a similar result.\nOverall as a device, I enjoy the Priv greatly.\nHas good build quality\nPleasing to look at\nThe keyboard feels more bold style than BB10\nBattery life on a stress test got \"That's crazy for Android\" reaction from Android users. 10 hour + screen on time.\nSlide mechanism feels solid and gives a satisfying type click upon full open and close.\nCall quality seems good as well. I've only made 1 call on it though. But had no issues on either end.\nHave not experienced the Android lag as of yet. Within the exception of BB10 hub to Android hub comparison. But I feel, that it shouldn't be judged that way since BB10 was built around the hub.\ufeff", "time": "11-14-2015 12:45 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4830673", "text": "Thanks man this helped me a lot.

But if that can be remedied.....now we have a phone.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "11-18-2015 07:51 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4857586", "text": "Re-visiting this thread.\nI picked up the hard case in military green, as well as the new charging dock pieces.\nI snagged a Smartwatch. A Sony Smartwatch 3 for a killer of a deal on Ebay. $99 (refurb) + free shipping\nI found a couple flaws, One being just about a deal breaker personally.\nAudio based\nA couple times now, I have had been listening to spotify and had it playing. I then got into my car and Neutron automatically boots up and starts playing.\nSo I have spotify already running along with Neutron at the same time.\nOne didn't cancel out the other.\nIn addition, with the smartwatch, I have loaded up music to that as well. So in the same situation, I now have 3 individual audio apps playing at one time through 1 source.\nKinda weird.\nI have had some hub glitches/bugs. I'd open the app (mind you in comparison as mention above the \"lag time\") I would then minimize it, it would full size by itself and then minimize again by itself.\nAudio through Bluetooth headphones seems fine, nice and clear and decently loud.*The Just About Deal Breaker*\nI recently picked up a new pair of headphones(Audio-Technica ATH-M50x) and stared playing music on the phone through the headphone jack.\nI found the volume very noticeably lower than the BB10 counter part at max volume even when using Neutron on the Priv.\nAlso, with trying to increase the volume by way of adjusting the gain, that bass clipped out and sounded horrid.\nBass setting was never adjusted. Just left at Flat zero.\nThinking I had a faulty pair of headphones, I filed a return on amazon from which I purchased them.\nI boxed them back up to ship out from my work.(will revisit this in a bit)\nI then think of a situation on the car ride home. I will try my brothers Sennheiser's. Low and behold, the same result.\nMe knowing that his cans(headphones) are in perfect working order, now start thinking its the Neutron app.\nNext I try spotify. Similar results. No adjustable gains.\nI tried the same headphones (Sennheiser) on My Passport, and sounded perfectly clean and clear. Again I did not use adjustable gains.Played on the stock music app and Spotify. Then I also added an external amp to it to get more volume from it. And had no issues.\nI also tried and external portable amplifier I have to swing some sort of balance out of the Priv for a bit.And it seemed to make it worse.\nIt fully appears to myself at least, that the phone is built for earbuds. EDIT: See amendment at bottom of this post. and not any serious breed of headphone.\nI'm not an audiophile by any means, but everyone has their acceptable spectrum. And The Priv, didnt cut it for me on this.\nBut, I can accept this to a point, because, I don't walk around listening to music on my phone with over the ear headphones.\nMy only hope right now, is that the box I packed up to ship out from my work is still sitting there when I get back on Friday.\nLast I checked, it was still there, But I forgot to look right before I left.EDIT: Headphones were gone and shipped back. So, I tried this again. This time with a cheaper pair of on ear headphones I just picked up. While the volume is still lower than the BB10 Phones, simply by turning off the pre amp in the phone through neutron and changing a setting that seems to be a protect mode for the headphones where it wont let it drop below 20Hz, it seems to be acceptable and does not clip out. This is partially my error, due to fiddling with the pre amp to get more volume out of them. I have a pair of over ear head phones on order, so i can test those again as well.", "time": "11-25-2015 08:55 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4859165", "text": "I can agree. Coming from BB0 to Android is a real struggle. Lots of Android seems like an empty framework and you have to fill in the holes. Now this is okay if you are using quality apps, but you sure do go thru lots of apps to find an acceptable one. And it's UI is more cluttery than BB10. And yes I know this comes with choice but it is overwhelming at times.

I'm personally conflicted about the Priv and keep looking for glimmers of hope that it will be a satisfying device.\nI've been using BB10 on a Z10 almost since day 1. I tried out Priv at a local cell store for more than half an hour. I was really hoping to buy one when I went in, but found the user experience to be less than exciting and, honestly, unrefined. In the end, I decided to wait longer and see if BlackBerry can do more with their Android OS. \nI also use Google Play on my Z10 thanks to some help I found on Crackberry. I think that Blackberry and Google have a potential to make some real magic here for those of us who would really rather remain in the BB10 arena: license a Google Play certificate to BlackBerry so that Google Play Services will work seamlessly in BB10. This allows me to buy and use all of the Android apps that I want while retaining the ability to continue using the OS that I know, love, and trust.\nYes, I realize that the BlackBerry runtime for Android is not as current as the real thing, but if Google would open the door a little more for BlackBerry (as I described above) then BlackBerry could continue to advance its OS offering (spending more time on, for example, keeping the Android runtime up-to-date), rather than trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear as it is attempting to do with Priv.\nAnyway, if it turns out that I must (which at the moment seems to be the case), I will keep an open mind about Android for BlackBerry and will take another look again once it matures a little more. (And, hopefully, it will start to look a little more like a silk purse.)\nIncidentally, if Priv could have come with BB10, or better yet, dual boot capability for BB10 and Android, I would have bought one in a heartbeat. The device itself is fantastic and it is just what I'm looking for to replace my Z10. I was just not enthusiastic about the Android side of things. My hope is that BlackBerry will be able to make Android look and feel a little more BB10-like and will continue to build things up on the privacy and security side of things.", "time": "11-28-2015 12:18 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4868527", "text": "I have also noticed these audio issues on my PRIV: Lower max headphone volume than my Z10 and very noisy low volume built-in speaker performance.

But with more Android apps now running the battery life is no longer sufficient to me. I would run out of juice around 3pm after unplugged fully charged at 6am.\nSo Priv is the next best option for me, with pkb that i should have no problem adapting to (fingers crossed), the familiar BB10 experience (although not the full fledge one), and hopefully enough battery to last me one full day and some with the many Android apps that i have (compare to passport).\nOnly waiting for it to be launched here in Malaysia. Only problem is the steep price and hopefully when i hold the adtual Priv in my hand it feels as good as I've hoped for.", "time": "12-05-2015 07:28 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4964584", "text": "Updated some info on the original post and the post with pictures of the hardcase about the audio.", "time": "01-24-2016 12:52 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4964723", "text": "Couldn't have said it better myself, ptm88.", "time": "01-24-2016 02:25 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5006950", "text": "So, to touch base on this, I went back to my Passport on February 2nd.\nAnd, I have't really looked back since.\nI had no hardware issue with the Priv, besides the occasional heating and the every once and a while screen click.\nNeither of which worried not bothered me as much as it does other people.\nI went back purely because of software. While Android has development out the ying yang, that development stops for me when those things don't work.\nTexting: SMS always worked, MMS not so much. Attaching a picture rarely worked, but this is a known issue by AT&T and Blackberry.\nI abandoned the factory loaded messenger app for Textra paid version and it seemed to improve, but I consistently got a file to large to be sent notification. Thats even after scaling it down to a smaller version.\nThe only way that it seemed to work, was that if you took a picture within Textra and hit send. It seemed about flawless doing it that way.\nWIFI and Bluetooth: I had consistent wifi drop outs and the occasional BT drop out on the Priv. Thinking I had a faulty phone,So I watched Android tablet (Sony Xperia Z2) and the same thing happened. Both running Lollipop. Fired up my passport with all 3 on the network (home) , Wifi drops on both Androids and not the Passport or my brothers Lumia 950.\nApps: \nAndroid: While there are many, they are not refined and glitchy. Apps that are designed for Android rarely worked correctly or without error. And it's not just the small independent ones either. Many of times, My Philips hue system awoke me in the middle of the night due to the wifi drop out mentioned above. And due to my settings, when my phone connects/disconnects to wifi, my lights turn on/off.\nBlackBerry: We all know that situation, so I won't re-hash that. But what is interesting, In my findings at least, While the Android app may open slower on it, it functions a lot better and is more responsive. Keep those active frames open people.\nIgrann > instagram\nFace10 > native facebook\nCB10 BB > Crackberry android\nFor the automation part like my Philips hue setup, @Cobalt takes the win with others whom credit is due for making the play store work.\nThere really isnt another course of action for this on BB10 short of Philips my hue website controls.\nI personally wasn't a fan of the BB10/BlackBerry offering for controlling them.\nAgain for the home automation point, I have a Wemo switch for a space heater.\nProblem is, I can't get the wemo app to fully work, Because within the app, I cannot select the connected wifi network within the app.\nBut, I was pro-active? and found a long backdoor way to get it done. Being as there is no website interface.\nI used the IFTTT/DO button app from google play along side Push Plane (push bullet client) from BlackBerry world.\nI made a DO button to turn the heater on and off. But then, I didnt know if it was on or off .\nI then used IFTTT to link my Wemo and and Pushbullet accounts and set the trigger to on and off or toggle to send a notification. \nWhile the DO button works pretty flawlessly, I do notice that the push Bullet notification can lag minorly to a lot occasionally.\nNotifications :\nThis one is almost break even with a slight edge to google/android.\nThe Hub is one of the best Notifications systems I have ever used.\nBest on BB10\nFeels like a skinned Gmail on Android in my opinion.\nWith that being said, I do miss the Google app,location based reminders and the ability to always see the temperature outside on the notification shade of Android. It's the little things. If I knew how to create an app and code, I would make a weather app thats similar with an idea I had.\nI haven't really found any comparable findings on BB10 without heavily diving into setting up and rss feed of sorts. (I've never done that)\nHonestly, the Google app and location based reminders and auto checking my traffic route from home to work and back are the main things I miss about Android. Everything after that to me doesn't matter.\nBattery life:\nPriv: with location wifi and bluetooth on all day, playing music over BT to my car while driving and checking traffic on google maps occasionally, and the regular emails, texts, social media I'd be generally lucky to get to around 6-7 pm with 10-15% or less. Screen on time, was 2-3 hours.\nPassport: same actions as above,different traffic maps/traffic app of course , around 6-7 pm a minimum of 40% life left. Screen on time unknown.\nThe first week back on the Passport was similar to that of the Priv. After that, it adapted to its normal self. If I didnt have location on 24/7 and loaded extra Android apps, It would go further as it normally did.\nIn the end, I'm still on my Passport today.

Note, I can't provide links because I don't generally post on the forums, and so I can't post links. I assure you they're there though with just a little digging  :\nGizmodo: The Android Phone for Everyone (\"It\u2019s cheaper than flagships like the Galaxy S6 and the LG G4, and I think you would be nuts to buy those over the Nexus 6P, which is a better phone\")\nWired: \"The Nexus 6P is absolutely the best Nexus phone ever. Hell, it\u2019s the best Android phone ever.\"\nThe Verge: The Best Android Phone (\"The Nexus was always a good Android phone, sometimes a great one, but never the best one. Now it is.\")\nAnd for a technical take, ArsTechnica: The True Flagships of the Android Ecosystem (\"Every other Android phone pales in comparison to the Nexus 5X and 6P.\")\nIt's perfectly valid for you to value the items stated in your OP over anything else, but note that the 6P beats the Note 5 (handily, I might add), in ArsTechnica's Wi-Fi browsing test, while losing in the CPU rundown. The Wi-Fi test is generally a test of display efficiency (if not quality), so take that as you will. In camera, I'd say they trade off, personally. Sound quality through headphones... I haven't seen anything stating that but I haven't seen it stated the other way. On the other hand though, pure sound quality is likely a massive advantage for the 6P. I personally don't think sound quality is likely to make much of a difference on any phone when you're using earbuds.\nAnd you're forgetting a couple great things about the Nexus line:\n- Software. Touchwiz might be (by some opinions) decent, but it's hard to argue that it helps the devices performance. It definitely brings some advantages, but overall, most (and this is subjective), prefer stock android.\n- Updates, updates, updates. The nexus 5 just got Marshmallow. That was the same year as the Galaxy S4, if I'm not mistaken. And I'm pretty sure the Nexus 4 got Lollipop, in the year of the Galaxy S3. That's a big difference in OS updates, not to mention the speed they come out at. My AT&T S6 (holding onto it until my 6P comes in) didn't get 5.1.1 until about two weeks ago. \n- Security. Semi-tied to the updates above, and kind of self explanatory. \n- Other features. Always-On. Actually getting Marshmallow before April. Ambient display. \nOn the other hand, the Priv? OS Updates, while I expect Blackberry would do well on them, are COMPLETELY unproven. This is a gen-1 product. Software quality is completely unproven. Camera - unproven. The priv could be a great phone. It could be a gen-1 device that needs another year to mature. And you said you'd return or sell it if you didn't like it, but why didn't you do the same thing for the 6P?\nIt's perfectly reasonable for you to value some points over others that cause you to pick the Note 5 over the 6P, don't get me wrong, but I think it's disingenuous to call the reviews \"less than stellar.\" I've already provided four that included some version of \"this is the best android phone you can buy today.\" Others I've looked at have included CNET and Engadget. Both concluded that the 6P is an incredibly good buy, and competitive with any other option out there. I'm not saying that it's literally impossible to prefer the Note 5, but I think it's disingenuous to say the reviews were \"less than stellar.\" I just provided 6 reviews that concluded either that it is the best Android on the market or that it's an incredibly good, first tier phone.

Let's keep plugging away at the battery issue. Maybe someone with an experience will help someone else's issue. \nOn that note I found an interesting thread and had a great discussion with a Blackberry rep I know through work. They stated that the Blackberry keyboard could potentially have something to do with the battery drain while using the phone. So for example you've fresh wiped your device and cleaned it out. Apparently that wipes the stored data for the keyboard and you start fresh with it again. So while you're typing the phone is aggressively storing the info it thinks you want stored. So over time, suggested a few weeks if usage, the keyboard will stop attempting to learn all of your inputs and thus save battery power, or some battery power. The reason I thought this would be worth mentioning is because I swear I watch the battery lower while I'm typing on the device. So I attempted to use another keyboard for a bit, Google keyboard, and I couldn't handle it. I had to go back to the Blackberry keyboard. It's so good.

I like that I can see all my notifications in one place, but I also like to keep everything separate as well.

Friday I got the itch and had to head over to AT&T to go pick up the Priv. Initially I wasn't too blown away, especially after using a great device like the 6p, but after using the Priv for four days and seeing how powerful the hub, google now and the keyboard is, there is no turning back now.\nI have been using Android since 2010, when I left Blackberry after three years of use. Since then I have been on all sides of Android, a formerly addicted crack flasher with Cyanogen and a bunch of other ROMs. So I am an experienced Android user and heavily vested in the Google ecosystem, but I have been waiting for blackberry 10 to have the ability to utilize google play services for quite some time but now with the Priv I get the best of both worlds. \nSomething about the HUB for me always worked, probably because I have ADD pretty bad like most business users and the device keeps me in line. For the past five days I haven't missed a single email, not bad for me. My usual \"let me open gmail and scream mindset\" is now gone. The physical keyboard I'm still learning and I'm good on swype but as I keep using it I keep getting faster and with a lot less typos and I think another week or so I'll be pretty close to my swype output.\nI think what blackberry did here is phenomenal, its a great mix of the best of Google and the best of Blackberry and I only think it can improve from here on out. I will say that going from Android to the Priv is a great experience, but from BB10 to Priv I certainly understand how frustrating learning a new OS could be and thats why that BB crowd is so pissed. I think what specifically works well is, if you were a former BB user and switched to Android - or you're a really open minded BB user and want to learn Android. \nI think the Priv is the most powerful productivity device ever made because of the Google now and BB Hub, and its a great device to from a comfort standpoint. I think any of the bad reviews were people that either never got the device (GIZMODO) or never spent the time getting used to it like a true reviewer would. It is different, and it works different but if your patient enough you will see the amazing potential this device could have on your life. Lets see how they do with the updates and keeping everyone happy but I'm not going back to my 6p or any other Android device, I like the complexity and productivity I have here with the Priv so congrats BB I think this device will be a great success!!", "time": "11-10-2015 01:22 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4818821", "text": "This is a great point and the reviews/criticism certainly align in the same way.

I think as people spend more time with it, they will get familiar and adapt. Barring a miracle, BB10 is near end of life and we'll have to move on one way or another.\nHopefully BlackBerry can continue to improve the apps and enrich the Android experience.\nNow...

I just got my new Priv yesterday, and I have to say even though I am impressed with the design of the phone, the build quality leaves more to be desired. \nThe screen was clicky on the left lower part of the screen when it is closed. So when I am pushing the back button and the virtual keyboard the screen part is moving and hitting against the keyboard part of the phone. \nMoreover, the left side of the body was very creaky. Without any big effort you can press the left side of the phone and it gives you a creaky sound. \nThese give me a bad impression on the build quality of the phone. I showed this to my GF and then we both decided to return the phone.\nLater however I realized that it is a very common problem, so I decided to keep it. After googling for some time I found a couple of helpful instructions on the internet which helped me solved the problem. These tips worked wonderfully for me, but I cannot guarantee it would work for you. \nSo these are the youtube videos for them. I hope that these work well for you as much as they did for me. \nhttps://youtu.be/9toHKLN_Kjo\nhttps://youtu.be/Uip2lqQeIBo\nCredits to the two guys here who made those videos (I am sure Mr. Freeze is a frequent Crackberry user). I take no credit for it and the reason I am posting this is just to make others have an easier time to find the solutions.\nFor those with clicky and loose screen, this might also help. Credit to lawguyman who is also a CB user (I copy pasted his post).\n1. Open the keyboard;\n2. Hold the phone so that your thumb is placed under but parallel to the screen (along the top of the physical keyboard);\n3. Place your index finger under the back of the phone under the speakers;\n4. Place your other hand under the phone by the camera lens;\n5. Apply GENTLE pressure to the base of the phone (not to the screen) with your thumb and index finger. You're flexing the base of the phone by the top of the physical keyboard. \n6. Close the phone and test for clicks. If there are still clicks repeat with just a little bit more pressure. Test again for clicks. Repeat as necessary.\nCheers, have a nice day, and Merry Christmas!\nInfo: This is a duplicate thread from a thread that I posted on Crackberry 10, so don't be surprised if you guys find a same one on CB.

But while on vacation last week for the Christmas holiday the Google Maps on the Priv went completely FUBAR with errors I haven't seen since using a Tom Tom on my Treo 650. I was visiting San Diego and the first thing I noticed was Google Maps was having huge lag issues displaying the initial route after selecting a location and hitting the nav icon (car or walking). The lag was pervasive, once it took almost two minutes for the map to \"zoom\" into the Nav mode view (tilted map). Once I was sure the phone had locked up, I was pressing the home button, back button, nothing worked, then suddenly it started to zoom into Nav mode but then all the presses I had made took over (flipped out to the home screen, back, etc. - beyond frustrating when you're trying to get somewhere!). Nothing worse than the wife sitting in the passenger's seat saying, \"do you want me to just get my iPhone out?\". \nIf I waited patiently the thing would finally start working, but the map location, rotation and updates were noticeably slow, and while driving at freeway speeds the map would suddenly zoom in like it thought I had slowed down/stopped and then zoom back out once it detected my actual speed again. Oddly the voice queues were \"on time\", and sometimes far ahead of what was displayed on the Priv's screen. Also all other software, menu navigation was impacted when Maps navigation was running; if I tried to pop out to start Google Music or Sirius, or even pull down the notification tray, everything was horribly laggy. Once I shut down Navigation, everything was back to normal. \nLag wasn't the only problem, several times Maps thought my location was in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, or it thought I was at the last location I went to. After a couple of minutes it would update, but that's something I haven't seen on an Android phone in years.\nA couple of times I noticed the GPS icon was flashing, so I'm not sure if this was a software problem or something is wrong with the Priv's GPS hardware. Everything was fine a couple of weeks ago, but since then we've had the much needed software upgrade from BlackBerry (I'm on an AT&T carrier phone, so I got it two weeks after everyone else) and I believe there was a Google Maps update as well. \nI was tempted to reset the phone, but I decided to I uninstalled Maps (basically back to the \"firmware\" version), rebooted, then installed the latest Maps updates, and then rebooted again. So far in my testing Navigation seems to be working as expected again; I can select a location in maps, hit the nav icon and it immediately zips into navigation mode. Of course I didn't think of this until yesterday when I got home from my trip \nHopefully that's all it is; I'm a little nervous as a couple of days ago I pulled up Uber and it flat out refused to recognize where I was; it thought I was at my last destination and I had to manually select my pickup location. There was an update to the Uber app I downloaded a couple of days ago and I haven't had any issues with it since then. I really hope it was just some software update issues I experienced and there's nothing physically wrong with the GPS hardware in my Priv.

Overall I kinda like the device but there are few things I've been trying to figure out.\n1) Is mail configured through the BES if one is available? I couldn't find a way to do enterprise activation - I'm not sure if thats because I'm not on a corporate BB plan, which was required in the past or if this just doesn't work with the BES like previous BB models. (Not a big deal, I manually configured mail, just curious of the true experience.\n2) Is there any way to create folders within the APP drawer? I am currently using a Galaxy S6 Edge and that's definitely nice for organizing apps. I know it can be done on the home screen.\n3) Is there a way to set which home screen is the default screen? I use 5 home screens, and keep the middle one as the true/default home screen (the one it goes to when I hit the home button) - then I swipe to the left for my calendars and then right for other things. Not a big deal, just curious if I'm missing an option. (I know some launchers offer this, I'm trying to stay stock, since the people I support will be using it that way).\n3) The AT&T version seems to have wireless charging but it seems really finicky. I've actually only gotten it to work once. I have a generic/Verizon branded wireless charger. Where's the coils? I've tried it in all different positions on the stand but like I said, only got it to work once. (Edit - the coils seem to be on the left side.. If I put the PRIV on the wireless dock and let it hang off the right side a bit I have more success.)\n4) Will the AT&T version work on Verizon if its unlocked? (I put a request into AT&T to unlock it, I haven't heard back yet but swapping SIMs when necessary would be awesome).\nI'm sure I'll have more... \nThanks!", "time": "12-07-2015 08:10 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4891720", "text": "1).

I had to open the email apps (I used Outlook) or the BB Hub to have email received. The same email was being pushed to my TabS and Note 5 when it was also inactive (wifi only since the Priv had my sim card installed).

Right now I have a 2nd gen Moto X on Verizon but am currently off contract and have the itch to upgrade. I'm only 25, worked at a Verizon store for over a year and constantly keep up with mobile tech news, just never have anyone to talk to it about, that's where you guys come in. I don't necessarily have an allegiance to any OS/ecosystem but would only consider an iPhone if I was going to jailbreak it. Used to have a blackberry z10 when it first released and actually loved it's efficiency (minus the battery and lack of apps). Been on Android ever since (LG G2 before my X), and up until my recent 14 day trial with the Note 5, I preferred stock Android because I absolutely despise lag. The Note was amazing, admittedly, and this is coming from someone who used to hate Touchwiz with a passion. The only reason I returned it was because Verizon announced it would carry the Priv on my 14th day with the Note. Hopefully that comes to fruition sooner than later.\nNext, a couple questions and impressions after I just got back from my local AT&T where I checked out the display Priv for about thirty minutes. Overall, I came away pretty impressed and it's definitely still in contention for my next DD. Best of all, no real perceived lag in my short demo with the OS, and believe me, I was looking. I'm most excited about the keyboard shortcuts and the efficiency offered by BB's software enhancements, even if they have to iron out some early adopter kinks. The Hub is obviously something I'm familiar with from my z10 days, and while it isn't yet up to scratch with BB10's version, it will get better. \nMy only two real concerns were with the pkb unfortunately. It wasn't as cramped as I have read, but I did notice some lag when typing fast or doing a Google search from the home screen. Is that something that can be fixed with a software update? And finally, when trying to swipe up on the pkb for suggestions, it wasn't registering reliably at all. Anyone have this issue on their personal device or could it have just been a one off display unit issue? \nThanks in advance and happy holidays to those celebrating.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "11-25-2015 05:20 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4857351", "text": "Keep in mind there has been some software updates to the hub and keyboard since release.

But that's a good point, I remember reading that on here but it slipped my mind.

And now that you mention it, I actually recall seeing a notification in the tray telling me that 50 something apps were ready to be updated. \nI'm coming from a pretty vanilla version of Android so my primary concern is that BlackBerry's skin will bog things down, but that didn't seem to be the case. I guess I'm just searching for some reassurance in that regard. I haven't been very impressed with Qualcomm's offerings this year, referring to the 810 and 808, and if I don't get the Priv or Verizon takes too long to release it, I may opt for an 820 powered device (m10), or maybe even the S7 after coming away from the Note 5 experience surprisingly satisfied. I just have a soft spot for BlackBerry and can use all the help being productive that I can get lol. \nI don't play any mobile games at all, yet alone any strenuous ones, so I guess optimization is what I'm looking for, and I know that takes time for new (to Android) OEMs. Any stutters or lag, if so, has it gotten better with the recent app/software updates?\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "11-25-2015 06:02 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4857410", "text": "Thanks for the reply man, in hindsight, my post was probably tl;dr worthy.

Have the app/software updates improved it drastically? I've also heard that the Samsung Gear S2 doesn't work with the Priv, is that because it's based on Tizen or is this common with other wearables.

I'd charge it up all night and usually have to charge it in the early afternoon again and then again in the evening... and then again all night.\nThe memory management was weird. It closes apps that are in the background so having 3gb of ram didn't feel like 3gb ram because my backgrounded apps had to be reloaded, kind of like what happens on the iPhone 6 that I had, except that it only had 1gb ram. I'd say they can just fix that with a software update, which they should be able to do (and perhaps they have) but from what I've read, it's still an issue.\nLastly, even though it has a super fast Exynos chip in it, the browsing experience while using Chrome was one of the worst I have had. I believe it's because Chrome was not compiled natively for the Exynos chip and as a result of that, ends up running single threaded. The performance of their native browser is very fast, but I just prefer Chrome because of the bookmark syncing.\nThe camera was absolutely fantastic.\n**Edit\nWow, it looks like I posted a wall of hate towards the S6. It wasn't like that. The phone wasn't bad, it was just... frustrating. Battery life is very important to me. Much more so than the quick charge. I just want to be able to unplug my phone in the morning and not even think about it again until I go to bed.\nThe Priv looks very promising to me.

I've never owned/used any Blackberry device but I was nostalgic for the physical keyboards of my Treos and Palm Pre and thought the Priv design looked great. \nAfter reading Russell's review Thursday night (and a few others for comparisons sake), I decided I'd take the plunge and check it out. I hopped on AT&T's site and ordered one for next day pickup at the Chicago Michigan Ave store by my office. Apparently it was a good thing I did it when I did, when I went in at noon Friday to pick up the phone I had to wait 20 minutes because they had actually had to go to the other AT&T store down the street to get mine as they were already out (so basically they sold my pre-ordered phone to someone off the street when they opened at 10 AM - nice). \nSo, what's the experience been like for someone who knows literally nothing about the Blackberry software experience? First off, it turns out there's a learning curve here with the keyboard that I didn't expect. Not that its essentially anything different than other physical keyboards I've used, but its funny after several years of using soft keyboards like Swiftkey how you get the muscle memory for the punctuation shortcut key - the first time I tried to hit a question mark on the Priv physical keyboard I locked up because my normal gesture of course wasn't available. Now I know it's an alt-key, but I'm old (52) and my close-up vision isn't what it used to be, and it turns out those tiny physical keys are kind of hard for me to make out when I don't have my reading glasses on (the soft keyboard has much larger depictions of the keys). Just something I hadn't thought of.\nAlso this may by typical for Blackberry users, but for me the alt and shift keys on the physical keyboard are on the opposite spots of where I would expect them. I keep hitting the alt key because its where I naturally expect the shift key. I think I've figured out why the keyboard is laid out like that: most experienced Blackberry keyboard users probably never use the shift key since all you have to do is long-press the letter key and you get a cap automatically. This is actually a cool feature but it's going to take some \"retraining\" time on my part to make this a natural input mechanism. But if you do your caps that way, then the alt key is really handy where Blackberry put it as you're going to use it way more than the shift key.\nI like some of the other shortcut features on the physical keyboard as well, once you learn they're there - I wish there had been a real \"manual\" on the phone or in the box for us first time users, but I'm finding lots of good stuff on the Blackberry Priv support website. \nOne thing that initially was driving me crazy was trying to the the cursor control via the physical keyboard capacitive features to work. While the scrolling function works fine, I couldn't get the double-tap function to control the cursor to work at all, and was beginning to think my Priv was defective somehow. Turns out its an issue with Hangouts, which initially was the only thing I was typing in. The only way I can get cursor control while composing a Hangouts text is to actually touch the text area on the screen; then I can scroll the cursor around. I tried it in Evernote and it worked exactly as Russell described it in the review (big relief!), and actually works incredibly well, I prefer it immensely over the long-press and drag on the screen method. Now it just needs to get fixed in Hangouts  Note that I can't get swipe-left to delete to work either in Hangouts, but it works everywhere else I've tried it. \nI can see myself using the physical keyboard for replying to work emails or typing longer notes in Evernote, but honestly I'm shocked how good the Blackberry soft keyboard is. Its method of text selection by popping word suggestions over the next letter in the word your typing is brilliant. I haven't even bothered to switch over to Swiftkey even thought it's loaded.\nOne thing that no one seems to get right in my experience (besides Motorola) is the initial download/transfer of apps. When I upgraded from my Moto X Pure Edition 2014 to my Moto X Pure Edition 2015 I was stunned to see it copied over all of my home screens exactly as I had them on the 2014 phone. I was hoping for a similar experience with the Priv and even tried the Blackberry transfer program, but it was lame as it basically transfers everything via Google Drive and takes forever, vs. just setting up a peer-to-peer wifi connection and transfering directly between the two devices. I'm still setting up my home screens. \nI am re-thinking them however due to some of the cool software tricks of the Priv, particularly the pop-up widgets which are fantastic. I'm basically opting in to all Blackberry \"things\" (except BBM - I've never used it, no one I know uses it, so why start now?) to give them a fair shot and see if the way they work will really make a difference in my workflow. So far the pop-up widgets are a winner (where they make sense, like Calendar, Pod Catcher, Twitter Mentions), the Blackberry Hub is interesting (although I wish the envelope icons would indicate the account color vs. just that little line on the left side), and I have no idea if I'm really going to use the productivity center. I turned on hold to stay awake but I haven't noticed it make a difference at all, the screen will still go off after the set time even if I'm holding it.\nOverall I like the launcher/app drawer, but am disappointed that if I reboot the device I lose \"OK Google\" until I've manually launched it once again from the search bar so the OS can cache it. And the power key being on the left side is driving me insane - I keep hitting the volume up button to try and turn on/off the screen. Also the power button is in a bad spot for me when taking pictures, I tend to put my thumb right where it is to support the phone in landscape mode. \nSpeaking of the camera, it seems fine, slow with the flash/low light as people have said, however I've had it completely lose pictures, meaning I take one, see the preview, take another, take another, and the middle one never actually gets saved. Happened twice last night, which is pretty frustrating. I also don't like how the lens is setup, it \"stretches anything in the farther edges of the screen away from the center, so if you're taking a group shot the faces at the edge of your picture are distorted, or if you take a 4:3 picture in portrait mode (to get a full-length picture of someone, for example) they are stretched at the top (their head!) and bottom. I've noticed similar behavior on other phones (my Sony Z3 Compact does this too in certain modes) so its not totally surprising, but unwanted none the less. \nI tried the picture password and think its a really cool idea, but honestly its quicker to type in a PIN than hunt for my number and then drag it around and precisely place it where it needs to go. \nThe wireless charging location is in the lower third of the phone which is unfortunate, since it will work with my LG WCP-700 charging pads that I used with my old Nexus phones but you have to place the Priv high on it so it covers the notification LEDs. The Priv will also charge with the old Nexus \"ball\" Qi charger, but it really isn't practical as it has to sit so high up on it that the base becomes unstable. The newer Nexus Qi charger (the small square one) doesn't seem to work at all with the Priv, but it does magnetically connect to it and when it does it turns the Priv display on - not sure what's going on there. If I end up sticking with the Priv I'll probably look to see if there's an official Blackberry charging pad.\nWhich will probably happen, because the Priv is really growing on me. Its a tad wider than I would have liked, but it still feels good in the hand and I really like the look of it. The bottom speaker is plenty loud, but I am concerned that the earpiece max volume seemed low to me on the few calls I've had (that could just be getting used to where to place the phone up to my ear, however). I also really like the charge indicator that runs up the side of the screen. This week I'll be checking out its Bluetooth capabilities, it will need to connect to my LG headphones without \"skipping\" when in my front pants pocket as I walk the mile from home to work - something that the current Moto X has no trouble with but the iPhone 6s is abysmal at (that's my company/work phone and it's getting replaced with a Verizon Droid Turbo 2 on Monday - a long, strange story in its own right). \nTo sum it up, so far so good, and it gets better as I learn the intricacies and shortcuts of the device.", "time": "11-09-2015 12:26 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4827476", "text": "Great review.

I went back to BB with a Z30 to try out BBOS10 and liked it but still had no PKB. Because the OS10 worked for me I bought a Passport and it was love at first touch of the PKB. The screen actually feels better than a stretched out full screen for me. The Passpoort PKB is touch responsive, you can scroll through web pages up or down, left or right as well as pinch to zoom righ on the PKB keys. The Priv should have the same PKB as the Passport. The Passport operates well for me and I was surprised that the Amazon Android App Store was already loaded in, and by using sachesi from your PC, you drag and drop Snap directly onto the Passport which gets you right into Google Play Store, as well as a fellow created cobalt which gets googles service to work for many Google Apps. But it seems the writing is on the walls that BB cannot survive on BBOS10 hence the Priv. \nHere is a Crackberry article on the Priv that is added to as more info comes out, Everything we know about the BlackBerry Priv Android Slider | CrackBerry.com\nAt this point I'll be on my BB Passport for another two years, whatever I go to after that must have a PKB, BB always made rock solid phones so I could end up on Priv. Unless something major comes out such as Carrier speeds going to 5G, I'll use the Passport, I fell in love with it, it looks weird but the screen and pkb make a killer phone.\nPS: According to the link above.
