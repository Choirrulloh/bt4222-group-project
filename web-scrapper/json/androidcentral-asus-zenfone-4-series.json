It isn't my daily driver just yet, but I'll say that it'd been a good experience. In so far as the value for the price I'd say its a bit tougher to say. I haven't really had any other phones that are typically floating around this price range (Moto E4 Plus, G5 Plus, Axon 7 mini, etc). What I would say is that it really depends on what you are looking for. And by the sounds of it I would say this is probably a good phone for you.\nHere's my pros and cons\n+Great build quality. The phone has a nice weight to it and while it might be too heavy for some, I appreciate that Asus put in a good effort in so far as the build.\n+Have fun trying to kill the battery quickly. Like I said I haven't used this as a daily driver, so I can't say quite how it is day to day, but take this for what you will. \n+Main 13MP camera actually takes some pretty good pictures. Asus does a pretty good job in so far as camera performance in this price range. Camera software is also pretty good as it offers a nice range of shooting modes including a Pro mode. Low light photos, while noisy, can actually come out alright. My one complaint is that there is some overexposure in some spots. But again for the price everything else is fine.\n+Fingerprint sensor is good. I wouldn't say great, but its very accurate. All I'd say is that its just on the slow side in so far as unlocking the device.\n+Asus is on top of their devices with updates. I had a ZF2 and they frequently put out updates for that device. I already got one in the two weeks that I've had this phone. can say how well they'll fair with major software updates, but they do listen to the community and try to address any bugs or performance issues when ever they can.\n=Performance has been good for the most part. The one thing that has bothered me a bit has been scroll performance in certain spots (in particular Chrome). This has improved after the update though, so it hasn't been that much of an issue of late. \n=Earpiece speaker has good volume, but people sound a bit muffled.\n-Screen is ok. Brightness is good, but colors are pretty drab. I guess its tough being that my other phone is a OnePlus X with a great 1080P AMOLED screen. There are certain things that also let you know you are holding a 720P 5.5 inch screen, in particular text and some images. I'd say this is probably the phone's biggest weakness. \n-Secondary rear camera with wide angle lens is just meh. With good lighting you might be able to get a good image, but there's plenty of noise in most images. Pictures also come out a bit darker (honestly not surprising since the aperture is smaller at f/2.2 v f/2 for the main camera). I appreciate Asus' effort to bring high end features to lower end devices, but I'd rather have something more useful like laser auto-focus, which they included in one of the lower-end ZF3 phones last year.\n-Speaker is modestly loud, with just a hint of bass. Asus has an outdoor mode that increases the volume, but does away with any bass and sounds shrill at the highest volume levels. \nHere's an album with some of the pictures I've taken with the ZF4Max.: https://photos.app.goo.gl/HV34VmlbL6FM9QRf2", "time": "10-18-2017 04:39 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6052507", "text": "Disappointing development. The ZF4M got two big scratches. One is fairly deep as well. Not sure what sort of glass is supposed to be on this, but there's no indications on Asus' website. I have a feeling its not Gorilla Glass though because I've had a OPX for a couple years and it doesn't have any scratches that are as deep as the one that is on my ZF4M. Ditto for my Nexus 4 which I used for 2 years and has been rolling around in drawers and shelves for another 2 years. I haven't even been using the ZF4M as my daily driver, so I'm not sure what could have caused these scratches.

Battery life is really, really good so far - I've had a Blu R1 Plus and a Huawei Mate 8 recently, both with 4000mah batteries, and this is much better in the real world. I use hundreds of apps and Google navigation and am hoping this may finally be a phone that can handle a full day without a charge.\nThe phone has the rare LTE Band 12 (and all the other US GSM bands) which I need for service with MetroPCS. Cases and screen protectors are available on Amazon and AliExpress with a decent variety for a newer phone. So far I haven't noticed any lag to speak of with the octa-core Snapdragon 430 and the 3GB of RAM. I don't game so that doesn't matter.\nThe only things I find missing or annoying are the reversed Micro USB port (larger side to the front/screen) and the lack of 5Ghz Wi-Fi. Beyond that, I might actually keep this phone in service for awhile - the battery life is the key for me, and it will charge okay even without using the 2A factory charger - another plus for my usage. The phone has fast charging and it shows.\nThe Moto E4 Plus is the other phone now available with a 5000mah battery and LTE Band 12, but it's got 2GB of RAM and a Snapdragon 427 Quad-Core, and for the same money the Asus is a better bet for me.", "time": "09-30-2017 08:33 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5999512", "text": "Thanks for the info!
