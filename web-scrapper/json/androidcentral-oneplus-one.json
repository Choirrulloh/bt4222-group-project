Testing with my wife we found that I am audible to caller but so very faintly it sounds very far away.\nI believe the culprit has something to do with bluetooth. I have been using bluetooth headphones for around 4 months. I have taken phonecalls using the headphones about 4x over this period. I believe after the 4th call it resulted in this effect. I believe that somehow when I now take calls the phone is somehow tricking itself into thinking it has bluetooth headphones connected and is trying to pick up sound from the microphone on the headphones and the reason it works with loudspeaker enabled is this \"force disables\" the attempt to pick up sound from the headphone microphone somehow.\nI have googled this issue many times and gone through many threads trying the different solutions offered. People have been posting since 2012 and earlier about similar issues with a range of different phones. In almost all cases enabling loudspeaker allows people to make calls but the caller cannot hear them without loudspeaker enabled.\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/Nexus/qJRGKkh4xX0\nThis thread, the author lists links to multiple other phone threads with same issue including the Oneplus One.\nWhat I have tried:\n1) \"Ok Google\" turn off. This is the most recommended solution. However my \"OK google\" detection on any screen was already off, so I tried enabling and setting it up and then disabling and had no success.\n2) Turn bluetooth off. Or turn bluetooth on and off. Or turn bluetooth off then restart the phone. I tried this but none of these combinations helped.\n3) Clean out the microphone. I did this with a small pin, nothing was dislodged. But seeing as calls work using loudspeaker I don't think it is the problem. Also if you shout quite loud into the mic at the bottom of phone the other user can hear you, but ofcourse you don't want to be screaming into a mic just to be heard.\n4) Turn loudspeaker on and off a few times with a call active. No result.\n5) Install app \"SoundAbout\".

To date i have spoken to Gretal, Sheira, Marty, Cyd, jiki, Lejeal, Mark, Lyndon, Rose and Leo, That is right, 10 different customer service people. Almost every time i replied to a message, i would get a responce from a different person. This made the whole situation difficult as they would not know the situation and i would need to reexplain my self, only to need to do it for the next person, and the next. \nAfter receiving two different emails diagnosing my issue as a different thing, i have decided that if they are not going to give me a refund or fix my phone (Which i am entitled to according to there warranty policy\", i am going to prevent them doing this to others by helping in stoping others buying this phone and slowing sales. On October the 12th, at 06:36am i received an email from Sheira who diagnosed my issue as a result of quote \"wear and tear via normal daily use\" whereas on October the 5th, at 04:27am i received an email diagnosing my issue as quote \"misuse/accident\" from Cyd.\nI guess you guys are wondering what the whole issue was. When you open the sim drawer to insert or remove a sim, you expect it to be a simple and easy task when done carefully. Well, the first time i went to remove the sim card, i had a totally different experience. When going to remove the sim, the sim drawer became stuck. This was as a result of two pins in the sim reader protruding downward, ultimately causing them to become detached when the sim draw was removed. Obviously this is damage is as a result of faulty internal hardware, something that i was accused of creating through \"damaging\" my phone. May i say that my phone has had a case on it its whole life as well as a tempered glass screen protector. \nAfter becoming increasingly frustrated at the idiotic robotic replies i was receiving a sent the below email which was replied to with sarcastic comments, accusations and just generally unprofessional comments. I know my email was very hard going but after essentially being robbed of $350 USD you cant complain.\nI need assistance in taking my case further and either receiving a refund, replacing the phone or repairing it! Unfortunately, a paypal dispute is out of the option as i am out of the 6month time limit. If any of you guys/girls have had a similar experience, please pm me about it and how you got through the situation. The warranty expires early next month so i have a feeling they are delaying my case so they can give me a reason not to help.\nAt this point in time, due to the poor customer service i do not recommend anyone buy this phone. Don't get me wrong, it is a bloody amazing phone, but when it lasts for five months and the customer service is terrible, it is defiantly not worth the risk.

[{"title": "Reception problems for One Plus only in Sweden?!", "thread": [{"postID": "post4708389", "text": "Hello everyone! \nIt is my first post, but I really need help with this one! I have googled a lot and could not find a real solution. I hope to get some clearer answers here...\nBasically my problem is really bad mobile reception using my One Plus One. The strange thing is that it started to happen only since I have moved to Stockholm! I bought my phone in the Netherlands, it was shipped from the UK so I assume it's a European version. Never had problems receiving good signal in Holland or Italy, here in Sweden it keeps on disconnecting from the mobile network! No LTE, H+ works only for a while but moving around the city the signal drops really often and sometimes it's impossible to connect to the mobile network.\nI am sure it's not the provider, cause I have Comviq that attaches to the Tele2 network and all my friends using Comviq can use 4G or 3G without problems almost anywhere in the city. Stockholm should have really good mobile coverage. I also exclude the sim card since it works well in other phones.\nCould it be that my OPO is not compatible with the network here in Sweden?! I have tried to go to a Tele2 shop but they cannot help me, they never heard of this thing. Do you know of similar problems?\nMy question would be, is there an easy fix in your opinion? I thought maybe flashing a rom that is very stable and optimized for \"mobile reception\" could improve my mobile coverage? I am not an expert on roms or kernels so I really don't know. If you could point me to a thread where they expalin how to flash a custom rom or kernel in a clear way I would be very greatful.

Some will likely disagree but it is a PRIVILEGE to buy a phone with loaded specs like this for $350. You won't get one from HTC, Samsung or LG for that price with these specs, and they won't make you get \"invited\" to pay $650 to get a phone either. If someone wants to overpay just because of a brand name, that's their choice, if someone only has $400 to spend and wants the best specs on the market and decides they gotta do whatever they gotta do to to get an invite, then I'm not gonna judge them.

But they are not the only company that's guilty of creating such marketing gimmick. They probably looked at how people would line up and camp out outside of Apple store just to be able to buy an iPhone. OPPO probably said \"hey, if we can only do the same, but we don't have the retail stores\". So instead, they hyped up the product a few months before it was released, and created a high demand for it by using an invitation only sale, which made the buyers felt like they're getting something extrat ordinary. When was last time a Chinese phone stirred up such frenzy selling in U.S? Wake up and smell the coffee people! You are buying something that's made in China! A country that's known for making cheap electronics and bad customer support. I mean think about it, there are already people taking about in order for them to make good on the phone's warranty, they need to return the phone back to China for repair. Are you crazy? When was last time you buy a phone that you need to send it back to the country of origin for the warranty repair? Notice only the Chinese companies do this. I mean HTC don't make you send the phone back to Taiwan for repair, or Samsung to Korea etc. It's same old turd that OPPO brilliantly spins around and turn it into gold.

No different than someone buying a iPhone 6 and selling it for $200 above retail or someone selling the ps4 for $600 on eBay before they were released last fall for $400. The point is to get phones in people hands, if someone wants to pay for a invite and then turn around and pay for the phone itself, that's on them. When I wanted my OPO a month and a half ago I would have paid $25 for the invite(thankfully I didn't have to). I paid $363 and change for the phone, with the $25 added on I still would have been below $400. Still $250 less than the M8 or S5, $350 less than the LG g3 when it came out.

Why you're having it with me like the company pays me is beyond me but okay, here we go:\nPersonally I think the invite system is working FINE. The only issue is the obvious one from the start: MORE PEOPLE WANT THE PHONE THAN INVITES WERE AVAILABLE. \nYes, people have moved on to other phones, I'm SURE OnePlus anticipated that. Do you really think their goal was to sell 10,000,000 devices based on invites and match LG and Samsung numbers??? No. The goal was to introduce the device to as many people as they could based on availability and production. If you bothered to click on the link you'd see they said they'd lose more $ on wasted inventory then they would on lost customers. You and many others buying another device or keeping your current device is a price they were willing to pay and I don't blame them. \nThey had a business plan, they're sticking to it regardless of what the negative feedback is because like it or not they are a startup and have to take baby steps. Samsung didn't always release 8 phones a year. It took LG years to have a REAL flagship. HTC lost all steam after the HTC EVO 4g in 2010 and didn't get it back until last year with the HTC One M7.\nIn finish, NO, YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT have to ask someone to give them your $, your choices are these: keep your current device and wait for the nexus 6, you'll likely be happy I'm sure, what the specs are and wheather it'll have more than 32 GB of storage and what that battery will be is yet to be seen. Or you can get a current model like the new moto x, the specs are the same as the OPO, the battery is worse at 2300mah, and it's $150 more. You can get a note 4 and pay $800. Whatever you do won't effect me so you don't have to convince me of anything. Whatever you do won't effect OnePlus and their plans going fwd. The company has room for improvement but I got top notch specs for $350, carrier unlocked, android l within 3 months. Awesome display, awesome build. THERE ISN'T A PHONE OUT OR SOON TO BE RELEASED INCLUDING THE NEXUS 6 that will make me regret my choice. I BET we will have android l before any Samsung phone, any HTC phone, any Motorola or LG phone. Our updates don't get filtered through a carrier and cyanogenmod breathes this ****. They don't punch a clock for Samsung or go home at 5:00pm. If you don't have nexus in front of your devices name, we'll get \"L\" before it.

Do you know if i get it back when those 16 (now13) hours are up to give to someone else? I gave one to AC forum member rcloke91 earlier and he wasn't f'ing around. He used it like 20 mins after I sent him the email. I sent bigballer's brother that email last night but he could be a busy guy, idk. I'm sure bigballer will chime in and let us know what's going on. \nFunny thing is invites are plentiful right now. I got my shareables Saturday and thought \"how do I want to give them away\"? Sadly I have no friends or family that are android nerds like I am (my father in law is a little but he uses a droid maxx for work and his company will upgrade him in about a month) so he passed on it but said around the holidays he may want a invite. So I figured since I got my invite from here and pledged to give them away here, I'd give them here, not as an announcement, but by watching, finding someone who maybe wanted a invite but missed out by minutes, whatever. But that's not the case. \nI just want to give my invites to someone who appreciated the bang for the $ this phone offers. Someone who knows android and CM (you can't have your first android be a CM phone. you'll think all androids offer this much customization and allow rooting, etc. lol). They didn't have to be a developer, or 12 forum member. Just someone serious about android and tired of overpaying for bloated phones with less or equal specs. I'm sorry but every time I see crap like this I get a little upset\nSo I just want to give mines away to serious people. Who am I to say \"you must be a developer\". Is OnePlus only selling to developers? I missed that memo. Or \"you must be a college student\" (huge argument with a guy in the OPO forums who did that). OnePlus has played enough games with invites, I don't encourage people doing the same. My only requirement is \"you must love android\" and the obvious, you must be ready to buy within 24 hours of claiming. Don't waste my invites, too many serious people want one.

I just don't see any added benefit to the capacitive buttons because the screen is so large already and with Immersion mode, the software can already take advantage of the larger screen. So why waste the bezel space for capacitive buttons? They could've gotten rid of it and made the phone slightly less tall. \nAnyway, so far, I'm enjoying my OPO. It's leagues better than my Nexus 5.

I've had the OPO for about six weeks, give or take. The Passport battery is rated at 3,450 mAh; the OPO at 3,100 mAh. In terms of pixels, the screens of the two devices are the same, at about 2.07 million pixels. Both screens are LCD. The OPO's CPU is clocked slightly faster, at 2.5 Ghz, compared to the Passport's 2.26 Ghz. Both have 3 GB of RAM. In short, they are very similar in the specs that matter to battery life.\nSince buying the OPO, I've been switching phones every so often, for several days to a week at a time; and I've been keeping an informal battery life log. That is, I just write down how much charge is left when I put the phone on the charger when I go to bed. My usage habits don't change that much. I listen to podcasts in the car, do some WhatsApp messaging, receive a fair amount of email, read a bit on the Kindle app, kill time playing Desert Golfing, update apps, and so on. If I watch any video, it's the odd YouTube clip that someone sends out a link to. I almost never watch a movie or TV program on my phone. A fair amount of web browsing.\nNetwork reception in my office is poor, so even with wifi on, a certain amount of battery power is wasted as the phones drop the network connection and try to get it back.\nI keep the settings the same on both phones. GPS always on; screen timeout at 30 seconds, medium brightness, etc.\nAfter doing this for almost a month, my results are:\n1. Both devices get more than satisfactory battery life. That is, they have power to spare when I charge them at night.\n2. The OPO typically has more power left over than the Passport. Usually, the Passport is down to about 20% when I go to bed. The OPO is almost always above 30%.\nThis is surprising, since the Passport has a substantially bigger battery. Moreover, the \"common wisdom\" in the BlackBerry community is that Android itself is inherently inefficient. This common wisdom, like a lot of common wisdom, appears to be wrong.\nI wonder if what's draining the battery faster on the Passport is the use of some Android apps that use the baked-in Android runtime. Checking battery stats on the Passport seems to confirm this.\nI use Greenify on my OPO, which I can't use on the Passport. But the Passport has settings that allow me to block apps from running when minimized/closed, so the effect should be similar. I have roughly the same suite of apps on both devices, except for utilities that are device-specific.\nSo, I'm just posting this here in case anyone's curious about it.", "time": "04-10-2015 07:57 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4346639", "text": "Wow this is very interesting.

The screen is a bit too big for my personal taste, but it's nothing I can't get used to (and already am. When I pick up my Nexus 5, it feels tiny now!). Besides the screen size, everything else is great. \nGood speakers. Great reception and GPS signal. Gorgeous screen. Battery life is phenomenal (went to bed with 64% left after 14+ hours off the charger and 2.5+ hours of SOT from an average use day). I just don't worry about battery life anymore. It's a lovely feeling. \nAnd more importantly, Cyonogen is great. It's stock Android \"Plus\" -- small tweaks and smart additions to the software that really add to the overall experience in nearly every way. It would take me forever to list all the helpful tweaks. It makes things easier and more fun. Software-wise, I think Cyonogen beats Moto's version of Android. I can safely say I don't miss anything from the Moto X (except for maybe one thing: I wish the white back was an option for the OPO's 64GB level). \nAnd I certainly don't miss anything from my Nexus 5 (though I can't wait to get Lollipop on the OPO). \nLastly, when I consider the value of the OPO, then I get even happier! $350 dollars for top-tier specs (a lot of which is very future-proof. I mean, 3GB of RAM?), amazing software that is, in my opinion, better than stock Android, and beautiful/reliable hardware, all unlocked with proper T-Mobile GSM and LTE radios... it's just insane. \nBest phone I've owned to date.

Just wanted to state that so you guys understand not a newbie and not \"operator error\" I received my 1+1 on Wednesday morning used it as much as possible through Friday night, ran it through every possible use as a daily driver. I sent a support ticket to OnePlus last night asking for an RMA to return it. Here's what I found on my particular phone :\nFirst off is the infamous yellow tint on the bottom of the screen, really not a big deal and as an owner of a Oppo Find 7a, it was expected. Second thing, no matter what sound, profile or phone settings I use, the phone will never ring more than one time, miss hearing the first ring and you miss the call as it will never ring a second time. The charger and USB cable that comes with the phone is the only cable and charger that will change the phone without putting it in to an endless loop of rebooting. (note: this is a flaw, as others have stated that the can use any other USB cable or charger) while on the USB cable topic, it is a pretty cool red flat cable with unique looking ends on it, though it is pretty short. Next thing is touch screen response, not good, tried the different settings for touch sensitivity, no difference, put 4 phones together all on the same WiFi network all on the same websites. The 1+1 failed to sense the area touched on the screen about 30% of the time as opposed to the Oppo Find 7a, LG G2, and an HTC One M8. Over all it probably is a good phone for the price, I am giving OnePlus the benefit of the doubt and just assume I received a defective phone, I am not going to ask for a refund, I am asking them for a new phone. I will see how that goes, their response time on support tickets is a little slow, but I can understand that being a new stat up with a limited number of employees.\nPosted via Android Central App", "time": "07-26-2014 09:31 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post3792094", "text": "Yep.

I thought some bug was possibly flipping it offline, but I started to suspect it may be connected to the alarm somehow.\nThis was confirmed last week as I had a mid-afternoon alarm go off while I was driving and listening to a podcast over Bluetooth. The alarm sound broadcast to the sound system, stopping the playback (or so I thought), but after dismissing the alarm podcast didn't resume. I tap the widget and the sound came from the phone. Then I noticed the dash display indicating there was no phone connected and that was because it had flipped to airplane mode at that moment.\nThis morning was the final straw: I'm a heavy sleeper, not a morning person and my job requires me to punch in within a very narrow 5-minute window, so I set an alarm clock, my phone's alarm AND my girlfriend calls to make sure I'm awake and not late for work. To help ease out of sleep, I have the alarms staggered - e.g. the phone is set for 7:06 with a 7-minute snooze, the alarm clock for 7:10 and my g/f calls at 7:15. Some combination will wake me up eventually. \nThis morning the phone goes off, I snooze it; the alarm goes off, I snooze that. Around 7:20 the combination of the alarm and phone going off together wakes me up. I realize my g/f hadn't called and figured she may've forgotten to set her alarm until I see the airplane mode indicator. I get back online and start getting dressed for work and I could hear the voicemail chime; she'd been calling. She called about 7:42, sounding worried as hell and saying she'd tried to call me 8 times.\nAnyone else seeing this behavior here and/or have a fix?

Not to mention my grandfathered in $30/mo \"unlimited\"[1] data... So no OPO for me...\nVerizon's network uses CDMA on 850 for almost everything, excepting (x)LTE and some old PCS stuff on 1900 that they are phasing out. VZW's primary LTE band is 13, with 4 deployed in some high-profile areas (not here).\nAccording to the field test on an GSM iBrick, there are no GSM networks that can be heard (I don't know what frequencies the iBrick's radio can receive)\nMaybe some day there will either be a better option for a carrier in my area, or a really awesome phone like the OPO on CDMA... \nI guess I'll just go back to waiting for that SunShine update, so I can unlock my Maxx that shipped with 4.4.4[2]...\n[1]: If you don't mind QOS after 4GiB, no subsidy, even if you can just upgrade a no-data line and pull a SIM swap, and possibly a \"Device ID Transfer\".\n[2]: Digitizer went out 2 months in, warranty replacement with a refurb (yech)", "time": "12-03-2014 09:51 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4109491", "text": "actually, you don't really want to go CDMA for verizon anyway.\nand LTE is a technology based from GSM principals, more like GSM 3.0 but still not GMS.\nBut look: \nConnectivity\t\nGSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900MHz\nWCDMA: Bands: 1/2/4/5/8LTE: Bands: 1/3/4/7/17/38/40\njust called about activating my OPO I received yesterday.

I can give you my opinions of the two.\nThe OPO is a great value. 350 bucks for a 64gb phone off contract is awesome. The phone feels really well built and the size is fine for me. I think the \"grippiness\" of the back makes dealing with a larger phone much better. The battery life on this phone compared to my Nexus has been great. I don't see a time when I wouldn't easily be able to get through an entire day (from waking up until going to bed) with this phone. The software is fast and insanely customizable. One thing that i noticed out of the box was that Cyanogen puts a number on the notification tray icons to indicate how many notifications you have from an app. This really annoyed me because it made it hard to see the app icon so I went searching through the settings and sure enough, I could just disable that.  I'm not sure what I think of the camera so far. It seems to get focus faster than my Nexus (which doesn't take much) but I feel like even in outdoor shots I notice noise when I zoom in on them. I would have expected less noise given the higher MP count, though I'm no photographer by any means.\nI bought the Z3 unlocked from Sony for 630 dollars so right away we're talking about nearly double the price of the OPO. I know the OPO is a rarity with its price, but it is something to consider. The Z3 is also very well built, though the glass back is quite slippery. I would definitely get a case for this phone. Like the OPO, the battery life is great. Once again, I don't think there's any way that I would burn through this battery before a full day was up. The software on the Z3 is pretty nice. It isn't too far from stock, which I like. Where this phone fails, in my opinion, is the camera. I had high hopes for this camera because of all of the reviews saying how great it was. And while it may be great for taking nice still landscape shots, it is HORRIBLE for trying to get pics of kids that are running around. The time between hitting the shutter button and the actual picture being taken is ridiculously long. I tried the Timeshift Burst mode, which is cool and works pretty well, but the pics are only taken at 1920x1080 resolution. If that mode was at least the 8MP resolution that the Superior Auto mode produces I would be fine with that, but 1920x1080? No thanks.\nI place high importance on the camera on my phone since it is the only device that I will carry with me everywhere I go. With 2 young kids I like being able to get quality pictures from my camera. I know a lot of people say you should get a real camera if you want good pictures but I disagree. Having used several iPhones in the past, I was perfectly pleased with the shots I got from them. The OnePlus One doesn't match the iPhone 6 camera quality, but given the price difference (350 vs 750 for 64gb) and my preference for Android over iOS, I'm inclined to choose the OPO.", "time": "12-01-2014 09:52 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4098195", "text": "Good comparison.

Everyone praises the specs on the phone at the price point its offered. I'd agree, spec wise, at this price point, it seems like a fantastic phone. However, in execution, it fails to deliver big time.\nI'm not going to get into the positives on the phone, everyone's read them and truthfully I'm ready to throw this thing in the trash. Full disclaimer, I've never rooted or installed any ROM/update to my OPO that wasn't pushed directly to the phone. I've factory reset the phone 3 times in 2 weeks and have seen the same problems repeat themselves.\nStarting with the hardware, the screen more specifically. It's Gorilla Glass, yet somehow, I've managed to scratch the screen. I never use screen protectors on phones, I don't like the tactile feedback from them. I've been using smart phones since resistive touch screens with styluses and since Windows Mobile, and I've NEVER scratched a screen, ever. Somehow, my OPO screen got scratched and it's never been dropped. Maybe it's a coincidence, but it's worth noting given as I've never scratched or cracked a screen.\nThe GPS is slow to track many times. Using Google Navigation, I'll make the suggested route move, and the GPS thinks I missed the turn and will start recalculating. It corrects itself after it catches up, but it does this quite frequently.\nLet's talk about the software, oh the software. The software on this phone is horrendous. It's absolutely positively filled with bugs. It feels like you're using a nightly ROM from your favorite creator. I consistently experience random reboots during phone calls, general usage or just sitting on my desk at work. Apps crash out constantly. I've experienced quite a few problems with Google Maps crashing constantly requiring reboots to get it to work.\nThe absolute BIGGEST problem I've seen so far is something that many OPO users are experiencing. The phone will NOT make a phone call when connected to an LTE network and not WiFi. It lets you dial, it connects, you hear the person on the other end and within 1-5 seconds of the call, the phone hangs up. It's not a proximity sensor issue, as I can put the phone on the desk on speaker and be no where near it and it will still drop calls. You have to turn off LTE to get the phone to make a call. As someone who uses their phone as a phone for work, this is completely UNACCEPTABLE. The phone is unusable currently on LTE, so in my opinion, it's a worthless paper weight.\nIn closing, I'll be moving to a Galaxy Note 4 or Nexus 6 shortly. The phone is not working out. I guess it's true what the say, you get what you pay for. With the OPO, you're getting a basket case of a phone that no one wants to say anything negative about.", "time": "10-29-2014 05:28 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4012435", "text": "use tempered glass... you dont notice any differencies...\nto rest of your post -> your unit seemed to be \"a monday piece\". i cant sign any of the issues you mentioned.\nabout phone calls, happening only in at/t network??\nSent from OPO.", "time": "10-31-2014 12:20 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4006665", "text": "Wow, that sounds disappointing.

I've been using the OPO for about 2 months now coming from a nexus 5 and a galaxy s5 previously. I do understand everyone is entitled to their own opinion and it may differ from mine, which is fine. But to me it sounds more like you have a defective device more then anything else. Which happens all the time with many different manufacturers. Like I stated Ive been using this phone for 2 months now and it is by far the best phone Ive ever used. It runs circles around my Nexus 5 (which it should, it has better specs) but not only that it runs circles around my Galaxy S5 also which has basically the same specs aside from the OPO is a 64gb and 3 gig ram. I use the phone on At&t and have never had a problem making a call on LTE, nor have I heard of this before. I actually think the call quality is excellent. My signal strength was a little better with the S5, which is to be expected from a Samsung device. It was the same story when the S5 was compared to the Nexus 5 also. But other then that no problems what so ever. As far as the screen goes, if you choose not to use a screen protector well then your just asking for scratches. Thats why they make them for that reason, and they are cheap. I spent the extra on the tempered glass one and its amazing. They do not affect the phones operation in any way. Like I said I dont doubt you are having the issues you claim, but I believe you just may have got a bad one. My advice would been to return it, if you were having so many issues as you claim why would you have kept it. Your right to many people do love this phone, its not that they are afraid to say bad about it, but more that there isnt much bad to say about it. You take the price and specs and build quality into consideration honestly I dont think theres a better phone out there. Besides the obvious ofcourse maybe being the Note 4 and Nexus 6. But thats because those are the newest generation. They have the newest screen res and processors, so not a fair comparison. Bottom line this is a excellent phone in my opinion, and many others for that matter.

No phone is using the 805 yet in the U.S. except the note 4 and that cost $800. There's NO WAY Google will use the 805 unless they're gonna charge $650 for the new nexus which Google has never done before. It's gonna a OPO clone with the 801. Mark my words: if it has the 805 along with those other specs, it'll cost upwards of $550 (which is reasonable). But I want talking about rumors. I was talking about leaks DIRECTLY from Google. How come the HTC Nexus tablet info has leaked but not the rumored Motorola \"Shamu\" nexus??? It's been reported that HTC execs are in Mountain View RIGHT NOW working on the tablet. Haven't heard anything about Motorola. I'm not saying it's not coming. I just think the hype is overblown. Everybody said \"I'll wait for the new moto x\", it's a smaller OPO with a 2012 battery. What happens when the nexus comes and it has the same specs as the OPO??? I say same specs because I assume they're going for the $350-$450 price range.

Do I refuse the OnePlus One and keep the iPhone 6 or return the iPhone 6 and keep the OPO. \nI'm currently using JUMP to finance the iPhone 6. If I keep the OPO then I can JUMP to a Note 4, Moto X, or even an iPhone 6 should I feel the need. However that's a waste of money. \nI like iOS and Android but at the same time I hate them both. I like iOS's standardization but hate their locked down approach. I like the app selection on iOS but hate it's simplicity. I also like how iOS works better with my current things. Like my car stereo and home entertainment system. I like Android for its customization and openness. Meaning I don't have to use Google stuff if I don't want to unlike iOS. I have to use Apple stuff. Even iOS new third party keyboard addition. I'm still constantly reminded I have Apple keyboard installed. For some reason iOS \"forgets\" I wanted to use SwiftKey. I also wish iOS had a 7 minute app test period too. \nI wish Android updated faster on all phone. That's one of my biggest complaints. Not only that I wish app development was easier for developers... Oh what's that Android L does. Great, but unfortunately it'll be a slow change. Which is why I want to stick with Android. Android L will do a lot for Android. \nWhat to do what to do dammit. \nI wish I can get a visit from both my future selves and have them both tell me about their experience. One that stuck with Android and the other that kept iOS. \nIt doesn't help that most of my friends aren't techy and have iDevice. So iMessage is kind of nice. Video, voice, and mms along with group chat is pretty damn nice. \nAll my techie friends clearly say ditch the POS iPhone. We group chat on hangouts but its still limited. \nThen there's the fact I get a decent Android experience on iOS with all the Google Apps on iOS. I know it's no where near as good as Android but it's kind of nice lol. \nAnyway I know the ultimate decision is me and I'm the only one that knows what to do but I'd love to hear from you guys on this. \nThanks \nMike aka Vahdyx", "time": "09-26-2014 09:04 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post3947936", "text": "It also depends on how heavily invested you are in a particular OS.", "time": "10-08-2014 08:43 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post3920228", "text": "I'm in a similar, but opposite quandary. Right now I've got an M8 and was a long time iOS user. This is actually my first Android device. There are things I love about my M8 (screen, speakers, I prefer Android's homescreens, I really love Sense stock keyboard, cheaper expandable storage, etc.). But there are some ways I prefer iOS (overall experience, better camera, apps run smoother and look more modern, deep integration with my Mac and iTunes, my closest friends use iDevices so iMessage is amazing). I don't really use Google services at all. In fact, I kind of find Google Now to be pointless. So far for me all it's done is voice activated Google search. Once I get past the homescreens I prefer the design of iOS as well. Especially messaging, mail, and browsing. I know I can customize with Android, but if I like the way iOS handles stock, then I don't feel like I should have to customize. The thing is there are more things I like about the iPhone 6 than the M8, but I'm just not sure if I can go down in screen size/quality, the size of Sense keyboard, better home screen implementation, and speakers vs the overall smoother experience of iOS.

I am struggling with the same decision. I have had my G3 since launch and received my OPO about 2 weeks ago. I have used the G3 as my daily driver for several months, and have been using the OPO for 2 weeks now as my daily phone. \nTo me, the G3 has some advantages:\n* I prefer its form factor and in hand feel of the G3 to the OPO. Its much smaller than the OPO with the same 5.5 inch screen size. Being more narrow and a bit more rounded feels much better to me. I also like the back better. I am not a fan of the sandstone back and wish there was a way to get a replacement. I never use a case on any of my phones. This is a big one for me- may not be for other people.\n* The G3 screen is far superior to the OPO. I am not talking about specs, but the side to side look of the screens. The G3 is much more vibrant and a bit clearer. I don't have the yellowing problem on my OPO so I can't comment on that. This is not to say the OPO screen is not good, but side by side to the G3 it seems washed out.\n* I like having the option of a replaceable battery on the G3. I travel sometimes and this is very handy.\n* The camera seems to be better on the G3, but both cameras are faily good so this is not a huge factor for me.\nThe G3, however, has one major issue that I can't seem to get around. When I load it up with my daily use email, social and other apps, it gets unreliable. It often overheats and will randomly reboot. I have reset the device several times and even had a replacement sent from AT&T but it still is not reliable. I thought initially it might be the screen that was causing the issue, but the phone runs flawlessly for days on a charge with the SIM card out with only WIFI connected. Maybe its the radio, I don't know, but not being reliable is is a pretty big negative.\nThe OPO on the other hand has been rock solid for the 2 weeks I have been using it. I miss the in hand feel and smaller size of the G3 even after trying to adjust to the OPO. \nThe OPO also has some additiona strengths over the G3 I should list:\n* Fast, reliable software. The G3 launcher is noticeably laggy. This can be fixed somewhat with ApexLauncher or some other launcher, but I still think these run slower on the QHD screen.\n* Value for the money. Cost is not a big issue for me, but if it is for you then the OPO is the clear choice.\n* The battery life is very good and very consistent. I can always count on it to act predictably. The G3 was the opposite. It would start to heat up suddenly and in an hour it would tear through half the battery even while off in my pocket.\n* Software updates do not have to go through the carrier. I am thinking this phone will get Android L long before the AT&T G3.\nAll in all, a tough choice. If the G3 worked predictably for me, I would probably choose it because of its better screen, form factor, and slightly better camera. But unless I can figure out this heat up, reboot, and battery drain issues, the OPO is looking like the choice for my daily driver. I will probably keep both for a while and tinker around with the G3 to see if I can figure out why it is so unreliable.\nSent from my Surface Pro 3 using Tapatalk", "time": "10-12-2014 11:09 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post3957811", "text": "I have both phones and I agree with everything except the reboots and the screen colours can be adjusted on the 1+1 so the bland colours can be addressed, I have my G3 rooted so all the LG crap is frozen and with TweaksBox it has all the setting changes I need.

I'm curious how much I'll have to change my habits - which pockets I carry it in, how I hold it, etc. - to account for it's Largeness.\n2) The quality. OnePlus, being new, has no track record.

I would honestly bet that our phone will have android L before any non nexus or Google branded device.

New manufacturers face impossible odds against a market dominated by Samsung and Apple. Even established players such as HTC are struggling, and other companies such as Sony have opted out entirely to focus on Europe and Asia. In the midst of this extreme competition, a new company named OnePlus is attempting to break into the market by offering the latest and greatest specs, software by one of the biggest names in Android, all at a price even lower than the Nexus line. However, an invite-only purchase system combined with production delays have turned some potential buyers off. Is the OnePlus One worth going through the hurdles to buy, and can it be beaten by more readily available phones?\nBefore writing this review, I used the OnePlus One for three weeks, including time on T-Mobile and Straight Talk (the latter running on AT&T\u2019s network), in every signal strength between no service and perfect 4G LTE. I had a few particularly heavy days of usage, including taking plenty of pictures and video at my brother\u2019s wedding reception, and two days of flying. \nThe OnePlus One ships in two separate and nice looking boxes: one box for the phone, SIM ejector tool and charging/sync cable, and one box with the USB Power adapter specific for your region. The box is very well designed, along with the included accessories. The SIM ejector is very well made, and comes in a rubber sleeve that can be attached to a key chain with an included metal link. The charging/sync cable is worth mentioning too. Rather than the standard USB design that makes it hard to distinguish which end to plug in, this port includes one completely flat side, and one side with all the necessary contacts, making it incredibly easy to plug in. Despite the unique design, the cable functions just as you\u2019d expect in terms of charging and transferring data, however it is shorter than I\u2019d like. With the included charging cable and adapter, I was able to charge the One at a rate of about 1-2% per minute, an acceptable rate in today\u2019s market. \nThe design of the phone is not what you\u2019d expect at such a low price point. The phone has an understated, yet classy design. OnePlus has designed swappable back covers for the One, and on the 64GB version that I picked up, the default back cover is \u201cSandstone Black\u201d, a nice looking and feeling design. The Sandstone texture feel like unfinished pavement, and makes the device very easy to grip and hold, despite the large 5.5\u201d display. Speaking of that display, it includes a 1080p resolution and Gorilla Glass 3, similar to flagships from most OEM\u2019s. If you are used to a smaller device such as an iPhone or Moto X, a phone this size may be a turn off, and rightfully so. You\u2019re either going to like the size or not. I like bigger phones, so I am perfectly happy with the phone. I wear relaxed fit Levi\u2019s Jeans, different brands of cargo shorts, and smaller shorts for exercise, and I\u2019ve never had a problem fitting this phone into my pockets. If you have smaller pockets, your mileage may vary. I\u2019m more into function over form, but I cannot say enough how much I like the design of this phone. I\u2019m even enjoying the Sandstone Black cover more than I expected. If the Sandstone Black is not your taste, OnePlus plans to sell different covers soon, including real wood and denim covers. \nWhile it may not pack as many pixels as an OPPO Find 7 or LG G3, the display on the OnePlus One looks very nice. Some users have reported an issue with their displays having a strong yellow tint, however that was mainly on models produced early in the production run, and reports of the yellow tint have become less common. I did not have the issue on my phone, but in comparing it next to a Nexus 5, the Nexus had slightly whiter whites and more accurate colors. Overall though, there are few reasons to not like this display.\nHardware wise, the OnePlus One not only checks every box, it does so very well. Inside, you have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor coupled with 3GB of RAM powered by a 3100 mAh non removable battery. The baseline One includes 16GB of internal storage (minus a small amount used by the operating system), however for an additional $50, you can upgrade to a more spacious 64GB. OnePlus explains the price differences between a 32GB and 64GB version would be negligible, so they didn\u2019t bother with a 32GB. The One does not include a micro-SD card slot, but does allow for USB on the Go in case additional storage is needed. On the rear of the device, you have a 13 megapixel camera with a Sony Exmor sensor capable of recording video up to 4K resolution, accompanied by a dual-LED flash and a microphone. On the front of the device is a 5 megapixel, ambient light sensor, notification light, and earpiece. Below the screen you have three capacitive keys- from left to right: menu, home and back.On the top border, you have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, a second microphone. On the left and right border (when viewing the front), you have volume and power buttons respectively. These are the only physical buttons on many phones these days, and they are nice and clicky on the One. Dual mono (not stereo as OnePlus originally claimed) speakers, a micro USB charging/sync port and the third and final microphone are located on the bottom. \nOn the software front, the OnePlus is running a custom version of Cyanogen\u2019s already custom OS on top of Android 4.4.2. If you\u2019ve never used a phone running Cyanogen before, think of vanilla Android plus a few really sensible additions. Some standard additions on all Cyanogen devices include custom unlock buttons for the lock screen, a customizable quick settings panel, a feature called Privacy Guard that restricts what data applications can access, the option to toggle between the included capacitive keys and on screen keys (as well as remap the capacitive keys) and a theme chooser that make skinning your device and simple process. Features specific to the One include a custom camera interface, an optional custom lock screen, and the Audio FX equalizer. For those that want an even more vanilla experience, OnePlus is offering an AOSP ROM on their website. OnePlus and Cyanogen have already promised the One will receive Android L within three months of Google releasing the final code. When I received the device, the capacitive keys were a little too dim for my liking, a recent update has brightened them up. \nFrom the settings menu, you can perform basic functions such as viewing a breakdown on battery life and set your ringtone, as well as some specific to Cyanogen, like choosing your theme and custom lock screen shortcuts. Speaking of which, there are few actions you can perform with the display off. These include drawing a circle on the display to activate the camera, drawing a \u201cV\u201d to activate the flash light, using two fingers to pause music, and making either a left or right arrow to control music playback. However, I noticed that these actions would occur while the phone was in my pocket, so I disabled them. You can also assign actions to the capacitive keys while on the lock screen. Because the display has to be on for these to be activated, there are less accidents than the previously mentioned actioned. \nBetween the bleeding edge internals and the light software, the OnePlus One absolutely flies. Switching between and launching applications happens in a flash, and even particularly heavy games run without issue. To put the One to the ultimate test, I loaded up about twenty applications, leaving each one in the recent apps switcher. Even with more processor intensive applications such as offline navigators, the One had no problem switching back and forth. \nAs mentioned above, the OnePlus One includes a 13 megapixel Sony Exmor camera, as well as different camera layout than what is included for most Cyanogen builds. The layout includes three buttons for quick access to take a picture, start recording a video, or take a panorama shot. Unfortunately, Photospheres (or an equivalent) are not included, but this device is compatible with Google\u2019s Camera application. Along the right side of the camera display, you have can toggle between the rear- and front-facing cameras, toggle flash settings, and have two menu keys for various functions. One function is a list of shooting modes, and you are able to quickly switch between specific modes you designate. For example, I have \u201cAuto\u201d, \u201cHDR\u201d, \u201cNight\u201d and \u201cMono\u201d selected in the settings menu, and I can flick my finger on the main camera screen to quickly switch between the four. The camera also includes a very fast shutter speed, and the pictures came out looking great a majority of the time. I took hundreds of photos using the One on a recent vacation, both in day and at night, of still targets and moving, and I can only remember one or two pictures coming out blurry. One camera mode, \u201cClear Image\u201d was only recently added. The basic premise is the One will take ten photos, then stitch them together into a super high quality image. It takes longer to process than a standard or HDR shot, but it is well worth it if you have the time. Similarly, the camera takes fantastic videos as well, and the three microphones will do an excellent job capturing sound. To say the One has a great camera is an understatement.\nAuto: \nHDR: \nClear Image:    \nBattery life has been great on the One as well. On my heavier usage days-3G only data, taking lots of pictures/videos, making lots of phone calls, navigating, etc.- I never saw the battery go lower than 30% before making it home to charge. Now that I\u2019m back to work again, I keep the One turned off in my car for nine hours a day, and spend most of the rest of my time at home on Wifi, using it for light browsing and messaging, as well as listening to music. Following that routine, I am easily able to achieve two days of usage, again with the battery at around 30% when I plug in on the second night. No matter how heavy your usage, you should have no problems getting one full day of battery life. Unfortunately the One does not include Qi wireless charging like other devices, but that\u2019s hardly a deal breaker. \nI noticed no problems using the phone as a phone either. The One includes all proper LTE and HSPA+ bands to let it run smoothly on both AT&T and T-Mobile. Sorry Verizon and Sprint customers, you won\u2019t be able to use the One on your network. There was an issue with earlier handsets that affected call volume, however that was corrected in an OTA before I received my device. I did have an issue with the GPS antenna however. I keep my GPS completely shut off unless I am using it for navigation. When I first received the device, the GPS would lock on quickly enough, but would lose signal after about a minute. Following that, it would not be able to find my location for five-ten minutes. After that period, it would regain my location and everything would be fine. After using navigation a few times, it seems the GPS has warmed up, and works fine without any hiccups. \nDespite the low price point, I can\u2019t find any shortcomings with the phone itself. It\u2019s fast, powerful, has all the right antenna bands you\u2019d expect, takes fantastic pictures, and has incredible battery life, all at half the price of comparable phones. Combined with a great pre-paid plan, this is a very inexpensive way to have a top of the line experience without the usual cost. \nThere\u2019s just one rather large problem: you can\u2019t buy one.\nOnePlus has implemented an invite-only system to control how many phones they are producing. It\u2019s understandable for a new company to do; the fastest way to go under would be to produce too many phones that nobody buys. However, OnePlus has had difficulties ramping their production up to meet demand, leaving hopeful buyers to look elsewhere. I was able to get an invite because I had been a member of their forums for so long, but OnePlus has also been distributing invites via contests. Once someone receives their phone, they also receive three invites to give out. This too, has been controversial, with some members selling their invites on eBay. The invite system is the only thing that keeps me from recommending this phone to everyone I know. \nIf you absolutely need a new phone right this second, do not wait for the One. I understand why OnePlus implemented the invite system, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less frustrating for people who want to buy the device. If you can wait, I believe it will be worth it. This phone is easily as good as - if not better than - the Galaxy S5, HTC One and LG G3, at half the off contract price. The hardware is new enough that it won\u2019t be out of date while OnePlus is getting their production sorted out, and both hardware and software will keep the phone feeling fresh for quite some time. The design, hardware, software, camera, battery life and network options all add up to an amazing experience, without an unbearable price. If you\u2019re not sold on the screen size, there\u2019s really no fixing that. Alternatives include a Nexus 5 (which can easily be hacked to run Cyanogen), as well as the Moto X and soon to be announced Moto X+1, all of which run (or are expected to in the case of the X+1) vanilla or near-vanilla Android.", "time": "08-24-2014 07:17 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post3853812", "text": "Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d\u263a", "time": "08-24-2014 07:51 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post3853867", "text": "Very Nice job on the review!

There is the 14 days return window, however, for those who have been following the official OnePlus forum, the customer service have not been well received (at least from the start). There are even Android news site like PhoneArena writing an article about how OnePlus refuses to offer RMA for yellow screen issues (I am struck with it as well), but it isn't the only issue. If OnePlus deem that an issue is not their fault and you want an RMA, you will have to pay your own shipping cost to ship the device to HongKong, which will be around $60+ from the US. Also the device is shipping from US, if you are buying this device from another country and especially getting it shipped to you by DHL, you might have to pay VAT as well. So that $350 price for the 64GB OnePlus might be higher in some cases.Build: I am satisfied with the build quality of this device, it feel sturdy enough overall, but not top notch. For the size it felt light, but not cheap (like Samsung). I was not impressed like what OnePlus touted with their promotional videos prior to release however. I will say that I will feel more comfortable dropping this device than a Nexus 5 or Samsung Galaxy, provided I have tempered glass screen protector for that large 5.5\" screen. The back cover of the 64gb version (dubbed sandstone) is very nice because it's virtually fingerprint free and look like it will hold up against scratches very well.\nThe plastic buttons are placed in very ideal locations and are easy to reach, but I find them to be pretty flimsy and thin. You can potentially turn off the device by accident while gripping the device and not knowingly pressing on the power button due to it's flat profile. Removing the back cover is quite difficult and I managed to dent the chrome trim in the process. I was afraid I would damage the plastic buttons when opening the back cover as well. Similar to the Nexus 4's chrome trim, I expect to put on some small dents and the chrome to fade over the time.Software: The software is one thing that is holding back the full potential of this device. As of July 2014, the CyanogenMod 11S version installed have many small bugs to be resolved, but my belief is they will certainly be fixed eventually. Some issues are things such as incorrect gain values for microphones input, causing low volume for calls and the 'Okay Google' voice launch to not recognize. I find that the regular CM11 version fixed some of the bugs from the official CM11S version. However, not all buyers of this phone will have the knowledge or desire to root and flash roms so it's still to be seen if CyanogenMod can consistently release stable builds for this device, my hunch is that they can.Interface: Some will love and some will hate CyanogenMod's interface. CyanogenMod is based on stock Android so the interfaces are pretty much the same, so if you like stock Android chances are you will like CyanogenMod. CyanogenMod have much more features allowing you to tweak the interface more to your liking, everything found from the stock Android's interface have been enhanced a little. CM11S come with a dedicate theme engine, where you can download free themes or buy them, some of which are very nice. My only issue with CyanogenMod layout is the \"Settings\" menu have too many settings that can be confusing to new users and will require time to get used to.\nThe ability to switch between capacitive and onscreen button is also a big plus.Performance: This phone never slow down, it's basically one of the fastest Android experience you can have right now, even with the looming of Snapdragon 805 devices, this device will hold it's own due to CyanogenMod, being a very light operating system. This might be subjective, but I find currently the phone might not be fully optimized to get the best graphic performance that the hardware is capable of.Screen: It's pretty decent for a 1080p display. I like the calibration which is more leaning to the natural side, so it is not saturated, but also not washed out like Nexus phones. However, if you are used to LG's latest phones or Samsung's AMOLED display, both suffering from unrealistically saturated colors, then the colors of the OnePlus screen might appear too tamed for your liking. There is an issue with a sizable percentage of OnePlus buyers having yellow tinted screens, usually there is a yellow gradient coming up from the bottom of the screen and taking up about a third or fourth of the screen, easily seen in white background. In rare cases it will take up a larger portion of the screen. This reminiscence of the iPhone 4 screen which had similar issues, some suggested it is due to the drying glue which will go away over time. However, there is a controversy over this issue between many buyers who are struck it and wanting a replacement by OnePlus, who are trying to downplay the severity of the problem (more below).Speakers: The dual speaker of this phone goes pretty loud, however, the treble become sharp at high volume so you will have to use the provided EQ (which is very robust) in order to have an enjoyable experience. It's no where close to the level of the HTC's boom sound, but it's better than any single speaker device.\nEdit: I've been told that this phone have dual speakers, but they are not stereo channel.Battery: The battery life of this device performs acceptable considering the 3100mAH battery capacity and 5.5\" screen. It will last you a whole day with medium use, I 'guesstimate' you can get 4-5 hours of screen on time. Currently I'm encountering a software bug that is causing battery drain. I find myself waking up with the battery drained by as much as 20% overnight.\nOne thing I must applaud Oppo/OnePlus for is that their phones charge quickly. When I asked other OnePlus owners, they all agreed that this phone charges battery somewhat quicker than average, providing you use a 2Amp charger like the one included. I also heard the \"VOOC\" fast charger used for the Oppo Find 7 is also compatible with this device (not certain).Signal: I find the signal quality of the device to be average and acceptable for phones these day. Not great like Motorola devices, but not bad either. Don't expect exceptional call quality from it. The WiFi signal however is exceptional, it have one of the best WiFi reception out of any phones I've owned so far.Why buy?:\nSo if you're reading up to this point you're wondering what's so special about this device, I think there are two things. You get a fast phone with lots of storage space (64GB) and a big screen (5.5\") for a relatively affordable price. Secondly, this phone is basically a Nexus alternative. To me, it is an upgrade from the Nexus 5. You get a better camera, more storage space, better battery life (especially if battery drain issue is fixed), somewhat better build quality, louder speakers, and you can root the device without losing warranty, all at an even cheaper price than the Nexus 5.\nThe risk you'll be taking is if you'll run into issues that require returning or replacing the product, and how well your experience with customer service will be. At present, this is something to be wary of since from my impression the OnePlus's customer service isn't great. I for one felt disgusted that a OnePlus spoke person actually replied to the complaints about the yellow screen issue by saying it was done on purpose for better color calibration and provided a 'fake' side by side screen comparison as his proof. Any tech savvy and veteran smartphone users can see through this ruse and call bluff on OnePlus (as many members had if you skim through the thread), it's very disingenuous to their customers.\nFor me, this device is just too big to use as a daily driver since it can be uncomfortable in my jean pocket. It's definitely a two hands phone. Overall, I felt it's a better value than the Nexus 5, even with the slight yellow in the bottom of the device. It is a good device if you want flagship specifications with very few compromises, but not want to spend too much. It will make a good backup/secondary phone. It's also a good choice for users who like rooting and tweaking their devices.\nThis device is definitely a winner in term of value, but to be successful, OnePlus needs to be truthful with their customers about issues with their phone and provide better RMA services.\nPS.

I get the fact that it probably is only apparent against a fairly light screen. And I get that you compromise somewhat in getting a top line phone at effectively half price. However I would imaging it would drive me insane seeing it at various times. I've seen various postings on the OnePlus web site forums about leaving it in the sun, UV lights, etc. to try and 'burn' out the tint. Seems like a bad idea to me.\nSomeguy points out that the customer service responce had been horrible. And its disappointing and troublesome when thinking about more potential problems down the road. Can you give us some more thoughts on the yellow tint issue? Bad enough to be noticeable on anything other than a blank white screen? Seems like its not bad enough for you to ask for a refund. Bad enough for you to try some of the odd remedies like leaving it in bright sunlight for 8 hours?\nThanks.", "time": "07-22-2014 07:19 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post3786443", "text": "I received my OnePlus One on the 19th. It has the yellow tint on the bottom inch or so of the screen. It's very distracting to read anything on a light colored background. It's apparent in Gmail, Chrome, Messaging, Google Play Store and anywhere ther's a white or cream colored background. It's baffling how reviewers of major blogs have missed this issue unless they were given hand-picked units to review. It's become annoying enough that I've asked for an RMA. I did so last night and received this:Hi,There are two different types of 'yellow screen' issues.One is where the screen is evenly warm - this is actually an intended effect as warmer screens offer more true-to-life colors than bluish screens. To adjust your screen hue manually, please go to Settings > Display & Lights > Screen Color > Custom > Hue.Another is a warm effect across the bottom of the screen when viewed from certain angles at high brightness. To minimize bezels around the screen, we place the light sources very close to the edge of the display. To prevent excessive light leakage, the bottom edge is designed to be slightly opaque, which is why it appears warmer from certain angles.If your screen has discoloured spots that expand over time, however, please send us a photo and we'll see whether it's a hardware issue.They aren't admitting that there's a defect with the screen and keep sending this same canned message repeatedly when users complain of the yellow screen.

Still you can notice it in white background, but I'm just not OCD enough to care.\nOtherwise the general consensus is the LTE signal quality of this phone is not very good and far from Motorola quality, I switched back to 3G just for better signal and hopefully save battery.

Received it last Wednesday (8/20/14) and received two updates out of the box. I side loaded the latest update (33R) the night it hit because I hit update phone and did not have it so the question of will this phone be updated regularly by CM is not an issue to me. My device has a build date of 8/7/14.\nComing from a several large phones lately but have a Nexus 5 through them all. I feel like the Nexus 5 is the sweet spot for me but had the Note 1 and 2 and adapted to them easily. Had the G3 at launch and was unimpressed with the screen, heat issues and bloat so returned it. Then got a Xperia Z2 which I enjoyed, but it seemed so fragile and I was too worried about breaking the glass etc, so I sold it. \nI then got an invite to buy the OPO and ordered it immediately. After opening I charged it for a while and then turned it on and connected wifi. After updating I started setting up and initially the OPO seems a little big but manageable. Everything went smoothly and I really like the device. I asked my kids to check the screen while white to see if they could see any yellow tint as I did not and neither did they . I put a Diztronic TPU case and a tempered glass protector (first I have used) and it is amazing! I really like the ability to customize everything. I was messing with themes and bought flux and flux white. Never really messed with launchers for several years so this theming thing was pretty cool to me. I am going with the capacitive buttons for now. Using double tap on and off. Since 33R hit thought I cannot double tap off because the status bar is too sensitive. I cannot get it to work because as soon as I tap it, the notification bar activates. I did replace the stock keyboard with google keyboard and the gallery with quickpic because I could not edit pictures with the stock gallery. \nI did not have any touch screen issue, ghost swipes, battery issues etc. I have been very impressed with the speed, smoothness and features of the OPO. I even pulled my OTG cable out and messed with the thumb drive I have and the ordered the Meenova to carry around with a 64GB micro SD card just to have. You had to root and use stickmount to use OTG on the Nexus 5. \nI am using the OPO on the ATT LTE network in DFW and the network has been fine and at least as good or better than my Nexus 5 which I would ding for network strength. WIFI on 2.4 and 5 GHz AC has been fine. Bluetooth in my Audi Q5 and Pathfinder have been fine. One major pet peeve I have on devices is low earpiece volume which has been fine on multiple calls with the OPO. The speakers are superb and actually startled me when I was checking the ring tones! \nBattery life is fine and have had about 50% left after 12 hours as a light to moderate user. Really pretty good battery life. Maybe not as good as the Z2 but pretty close! \nOverall, I am pretty impressed with this device regardless of the price. It is a nice sized phone, great screen and can be customized in so many ways. CM is doing an outstanding job squashing bugs and updating! I think the OPO blows the Nexus 5 out of the water, at least mine does. Of course I will keep my Nexus as I always have a Nexus but the OPO is my daily driver and I do not see that changing anytime soon.", "time": "08-24-2014 09:25 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Google Play Services stopping a lot", "thread": [{"postID": "post3851333", "text": "I searched didn't see any reference anyplace.

If you want to, get it from oppostyle.com (probably won't be avaliable) or swappa.com.\nLet me make a case for you though. If you are going to spend $500, get the Oppo Find 7a. It is going to be better overall. Why buy inferior counterpart for more?\nThe Find 7a is compatible with CyanogenMod and you do not lose your warranty by rooting or flashing CM. Even if you really want CM11S, I can tell you it's almost exactly similar to regular CM11. You can download the CM11S camera app and sideload it to the Find 7a. Eventually, developers will port CM11S to the Find 7a anyway, since the two devices are nearly identical.\nWhile the OnePlus does charge faster than the average phone, the Oppo have VOOC charging which charges your battery to 70% in 30mins.\nOppo Find 7a have removable battery and microSD.\nI haven't had to deal with their customer service, but from the evidence I have seen, if you have not been following OnePlus forum, I suggest you do. There are many unhappy customers who have defective devices or yellow screen issues, and a sizable amount of them have not been treated well.

However, the Nexus 5 has financial support from Google to get to this price. The OnePlus One appears to be hitting its price point all on its own.\nThe OnePlus One is also in striking distance for the low-end. A 16 GB Moto G costs around $199. If you have an extra $100 and you don't mind the bigger size, you can get a OnePlus One instead. $100 is not an insignificant amount, but it'll probably give people something to think about before purchasing a phone.\nIt remains to be seen whether the OnePlus One is a good phone or not.

Got any invites to give me?\"), I think it'd be more constructive to preemptively start a single thread for lucky ACers to post their experiences and take questions. My comments below were in the middle of one thread and I see someone else started a topic, so best nip the spread in the bud sooner than later.\n(Originally posted starting on July 7, 2014)\nOK, some snap thoughts from the first few hours of messing with it:\n* Last night I thought call volume was too low, but it may've just been my g/f low-talking because she was in a bad mood. Today sounded better, but it's not as loud as the N5.\n* It's big. B-I-G! I though the step up from my Nexus 4 to 5 was big; hoo boy. I've got manly hands and one-handing this may be problematic. It feels very solid, but I wish the sides were more like the N5's which I almost ran naked before putting a TPU case on it since it didn't feel slippery. The One doesn't immediately make me fear dropping it, but give me time to hold it in daily use.\n* I have minor yellowing extending about 3/4\" in from the bottom. Unless you're on an all-white screen and sorta looking for it, it's not super apparent. We'll see if it fades \"as the glue dries\" if that's the cause as claimed by 1+. It's sharp and clear otherwise. Display Tester shows gamma is all over the place (i.e. not near 2.2); hopefully recommendations for the custom settings option will be forthcoming. \n* The unboxing videos don't convey how deluxe the presentation is. The silicone sleeve on the SIM ejector - one weird thing: it loads upside down from what you'd expect - and the flat USB cable are pretty primo for a device selling for half of the Big Boys. Same with the box and slip case. They didn't scrimp on the packaging. Maybe they should've?\n* I ran the latest update before unlocking and rooting, but I find call volume disappointing and the speakerphone wasn't much better. The speakers themselves in watching YouTube vids are hella loud, so I'm not sure what's up with that.\n* The feel of CM11S is just enough different from vanilla Android as to trip me up a bit. Tweaking the ins and outs of the UI is going to take a bit. Tried a few themes and don't care for them. I'm running Holo and I'm fine.\n* The screen shows finger streaks more than the N5 does.\n* I'm using the capacitive buttons to finally get the use off all the real estate like Samsung people do. It sucks that you can't reassign the order of buttons, but it's intuitive to double-tap Home to get Google Now up and long-press for recent apps. The dedicated Menu key is whack. They need to allow rebinding of all of these.\n* Pro Tip: If you unlock and root, after unlocking you will need to go back in and re-activate Developer Mode and switch off the protect CM Recovery options to actually shove TWRP over and then SuperSU. The guide at XDA isn't clear about that and comments show this is tripping up some users. \n* Initial charging took a looooooooooong time. 42% out of the box to 100% took about 5 hours with the last hour hanging on 97%. That may be a glitch; don't read much into it.\n* No idea on battery life or Bluetooth performance yet. GPS locks in quickly. Initial APN setup only showed H+ service, but a reboot switches it to 4G and the settings menu shows it's LTE. This is typical, so not a bug, though it would've been nice for it to say LTE.\nI'll update this post as I live with it.UPDATE #1:\n* I popped it on the charger after it went down to 45% after 8-1/2 hours with 3 hours of SOT. It charged back to 100% in about 90 minutes, with the last half-hour topping the last 5% or so.\n* The screen is a real smudge magnet. The Nexus 5 was far better at handling/hiding that. I don't have greasy hands; wash them frequently. (No, not OCD.)\n* Just discovered the double-tap to turn on screen feature. Much easier than looking for the low-profile power button.\n* Swiping from the lock screen or using the circle gesture to get to the camera doesn't seem to work if you have a pattern lock for security. I disabled the gesture.UPDATE #2 (2nd day of use):\n* Battery life is SICK!!! I'm currently at 40% after a binge of app installing and I've been unplugged for 18 hours and have over 3-1/4 hours of screen on time. My Nexus 5 was lucky to last 10-12 hours with 2-3 hours of SOT. \n* For some reason when going through the app drawer to drag icons to home screens and folders, it resets to the beginning of the list every time you go back in. (i.e. If you want to drag out Tumblr then Yelp you have to page through from the As to get to the Ys.) When I had accidentally reset my N5's home screens while trying to fix a Google Now issue, I noticed that until some Google thing or another updated (can't recall, may've been Search) it would do the same thing, but now on my N5 if I go pages in, drag an icon, then hit the App Drawer button, it returns me to where I left off. A minor inconvenience, but still annoying. \n* Call quality is OK, but could be somewhat louder in the earpiece. I haven't had to deal with a really noisy environment, but they need to pump up the volume some more.\n* This thing really loves to show the fingerprints. Same finger dragged on the N5 then the 1+O shows barely a trace on the former and plenty of grease on the latter.

I don't believe in censorship so I am posting this.... Not a fan of the current forum or invite system....\nSo it seems @David S. is trying to bring down the fact that I got a device.\nDavid Inman is a relative of mine, and due to the lack of him not being able to use the phone on Verizon he sent me the device. He was winner number 21 of the Smash the Past contest, and that's why @David S. is trying to trivialize my previous thread.It's Here! - OnePlus Forums\nHe's not happy I said it took longer to ship instead of creating a complex story, that most people won't believe anyway. I've also confirmed with David today that he'll be sending me all of his invites as well.\nStrange enough this is all being done to cover up a series of items.\n1. The phone was shipped without a box or accessories, leaving no way to charge the phone, or even remove the SIM tray.\n2. The boot up time is so long I thought the device didn't work at first. You have to hold the power button down for almost 30 seconds just to get it to turn on.\n3. The call quality is **** poor, AT BEST. I've attached an image of the speaker up top and you can see only 4 of the holes on the speaker are open. The rest are covered over with the molding. This an issue that has been brought up by everyone who has tested the device, and it's obvious. I'm on T-Mobile here in the US, and the connectivity sucks compared to my Nexus 5.\n4. The camera is a cheap version of the one available on the Z2. The addition of all of the customization and filters in the camera app try to hide the fact, but it's obvious. Pictures will be posted soon. There is no noticeable difference compared to my Nexus 5.\n5. All Nexus devices are receiving 4.4.3 this Friday, the 23rd, dating this device already.\n6. The more I use Cyanogen, the more I realize that it's got so many useless features and customization I'd prefer Vanilla Android over it. That's an opinion though.\n7. The stereo speakers are no where near what HTC offers with LAST YEAR'S ONE. As soon as you hold the phone horizontally your palm covers them and you can't hear anything. Even with some hand adjustments they shoot the sound to one side.\nI will be keeping my Nexus 5 for now. I'll run some more tests with the OPO over the next few weeks and post a full on review later. If it continues the way this company is making impressions on people who have their devices, the smashing the past will consist of a OPO very shortly.\nLooking forward to the Oppo Find 7 and LG G3 coming out over this.\nSIMPLY PUT, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.\n@David S. Live by social media, die by it. Don't let the hype of a company dictate the quality of a product. It wears off rather quickly once you get the devices in the hands of people who want to really use them.\nUpdate: Just received a message from @David S. saying that all of the aforementioned issues will be fixed with a software update next week, and that they're all known.

Color me very skeptical that more than few people can get a phone with those specs at only $299, since I think this is just a short time attention getting promotion for marketing. OnePlus has been using social media to get everyone's attention. The only way you can even get on the list to get this phone is to win one of OnePlus contests. Winning the OnePlus smash your smartphone contest (100 winners) give you their One phone for $1 and then 3 invites for friends to buy pone at $299. \nOnePlus is a startup founded by former Oppo executive Pete Lau. The One phone is rumored to being manufactured by OPPO which makes no sense to me since Oppo Fine 7 phone that is just now being released is sell at $595 for the same specs as One. Note even Oppo's Find 7a with lower specs is still $495 and just hitting the USA. \nI hope this phone at $299 knocks it out of the park and I will buy one. However OnePlus is a Chinese smartphone startup that has never made a phone before that could be out of business if there are big issues or if it doesn't sell well. HTC is losing a lot of money every year selling expensive phones and OnePlus has a very small profit at $299.

Yes, the Note 3 costs more. But let's be realistic about things for a second. If cost/specs was a main concern then no one would buy iPhones, whose specs pale compare to android. For the best cost/spec ratio before the oneplus one, it would be the nexus series. But how well does the nexus smartphones sell? In online forums you see a lot of people talking about them, but in real life, I have never seen anyone with a nexus 4/5, but a lot of people with S3/S4/N2/N3. And at least, the Nexus has two advantages. Pure android and made by google. And yes, name makes a big difference. Let's say that someone else made the phone identical to the nexus 5, but the company was not a well known name. It would not sell anywhere as well as the Nexus 5, which doesn't sell as well as say the S4 anyway.\nAside from that, it doesn't support Verizon, which the s5//n3/m8 all support. and even though it works on AT&T, it is missing bands 2 and 5 support which at&t uses in limited deployment, and Tmobile will be deploying band 2 lte starting this year. Not to mention, it doesn't have a stylus or removable battery or microsd card. It doesn't support carrier aggregation. So there certainly are things that it is missing that matter to some people.

Each has things I like over the other. It's a really tough choice..\nAnd for those saying they are separate companies.. yes, they are separate but they are funded by the same parent company, the phones were designed by the same designer and also made in the same factory.\nI'm friends with someone at OnePlus (and formerly Oppo) I first heard about OnePlus before they even had a name picked  At BBQ 13 he told me why OnePlus was going to be formed.. I heard it straight from the horses mouth. Oppo was having a hard time competing in places like china because of so much competition like Xiaomi who were putting out quality devices on the cheap. This made oppo start to rethink things because compared to the competition Oppo devices are expensive (in China) They did not want to come out with a cheaper handset because they are known for quality.

This will mean better battery life too (unless the Find 7 will come out with bigger battery).\nWhy Find 7a over OnePus:\n-The Find 7a have removable backcover, however, it's battery is removable as well, so you can use one of those qi receiver tag to get wireless charging, and keep it hidden inside the phone. With the OnePlus you would need to use the receiver tag with microSD port, which is not ideal.\n-VOOC charging.\n-MicroSD.\n-The Find 7a is also bootloader unlockable and very easy to install custom rom. You will get CM11S on it easily so it will get all the features that the OnePlus have.\n-Lastly, it's more accessible for purchase (oppostyle.com), no need to wait for invite system and worrying about how much they will manufacture.

I am still going to give OnePlus props for undercutting the Nexus 5 pricing, but is it really any amazing deal as it seems?\nThe way I see it, both OnePlus and Oppo are subsidiaries of the the BKK investor company. Creating a phone company and producing them at numbers at this level isn't something you can get from a simple Kickstarter project (just ask Ubuntu). To me, the OnePlus \"branch\" is more of an offshoot of Oppo, despite the Never Settle slogan, this phone is specifically a stripped down Oppo Find 7 with compromises. It use most similar parts from the Oppo Find 7, so this ensure the cost.\n[On the surface, what we know] What the Oppo Find 7 / 7a have that the OnePlus don't:\n-Direct purchase on release\n-VOOC charging\n-microSD\n-removable battery\n-1440p display\nThe Find 7 can bring up Google Now at anytime (while screen off) by saying Okay Snapdragon. This was hinted with the OnePlus, but still not yet confirmed.\nIt's true that some people may suggest the price diff of $300 vs $500 validated the lacking of features. However, there is a marketing strategy here, I don't think their business interest is to be building up a brand like Oppo and then directly compete with themselves to lower the sale numbers of one or the other. There have to be other compromises to justify that $200 difference, aside from the fact the OnePlus is only available for purchase online and lacking the Find 7 features I just listed. I think the durability could be one of it. From Android Police Podcast 108 (watch from 38:25), they discussed about potential durability issues with this phone. Of course, this is all speculation because it's not released yet. Or I think the OnePlus is a branch they use for experiment (CyanogenMod) and testing the public interests.\nFor Oppo phones US owners, there are places in America you can ship your phone to for warranty repair services. I'm not sure how it is with the OnePlus yet.\nAs for CyanogenMod partnership, this is actually the number one reason why I would choose a phone. But Oppo phones is just as easily rooted and will get CM support, and both the Oppo and OnePlus will use similar hardwares, so I don't think there is much of an advantage for the OnePlus here.\nTo me the OnePlus is an amazing phone, it's basically a Nexus owner come true, because it have Nexus pricing with better hardware (ie camera, storage space, non-crappy screen calibration). However, the performance to me just only marginally better than other 2014 flagships. When you are running stock Android, it's not going to matter very much. Lastly, I know this is subjective, but this pretty much sum up why I don't want either the Find 7 or OnePlus: Visual Phone Size Comparison\nIf I was coming from a previously generation phone (a phone from 2012), then I would totally consider the OnePlus as an update. But now I am using the Moto X and it offers some of the most practical features that are helpful for daily uses (and yes, the compact size is one of the feature). Therefore the OnePlus with low price and good performance by itself isn't enough to replace the Moto X as my daily driver.", "time": "04-27-2014 12:57 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post3618524", "text": "It's perfectly fine to keep your Moto X.

A 64 GB iPod Touch costs $399. Why not get a 64 GB OnePlus One for $50 less?\nI have a feeling that OnePlus will look at their sales and see who bought their phone and who didn't.

Tip Top Specs/Hardware mean little if the phone gets almost no long term support/updates..... from the hardware side it should be a great device for at LEAST 3 - 6 months.... and then what???? \nbut I'll smash this old GS3... heck if they opened up preorders I'd buy the 64 gig black one to play with....", "time": "04-26-2014 03:49 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post3609375", "text": "Ya I signed up but I would never smash my moto x for it.
