This thing is a beast.", "time": "24th June 2016, 10:58 AM", "postID": "post67462260", "replies": []}, {"text": "As a previous owner of the oneplus 1 and then the oneplus 2,  I can say that oneplus has out done themselves.  I got my 3 in yesterday.  Couple of quick points:\n\r\n1. I waited for 6 weeks after initial launch date to just get an invite for the oneplus one (June 2014).  It took the company 4 more weeks to get it to me after ordering and paying for it. Customer service sucked,  invite system sucked, logistics and management sucked... Just about everything with the company SUCKED. \r\nBut the phone was awesome.\r\nThe specs and price couldn't be matched. That was the first phone I can honestly say I have ever fallen in love with. No screen issues or any of the other crap a lot of people were complaining about. Just pure love for the device,  borderline hatred for the company though.  \n\r\n2. The oneplus 2 comes out last summer,  again, with an invite system but I get lucky and receive one for being an early forum user within 2 weeks of official launch. It took them 6 weeks to get the phone to me. Was excited when I first got it,  and then my optimism quickly turned to disappointment. The oneplus 2 was not nearly worth the upgrade. I should have kept my oneplus one in hindsight. Total buyer's remorse and top of that,  the company still didn't have their shlt together. Again, customer service still sucking hard, untimely bug fixes for the OS, lags and heating problems with the phone, I could go on and on... Horrible experience all the way around. Hated that damn phone. \n\r\n3. One more shot oneplus. Buying my 3rd phone from them in less years.  3 total phone purchases in less than 2 years. And only had the oneplus 2 since late September 2015, though it was ordered and processed the 2nd week of August. \r\nWith much apprehension, I placed my order for the 3,  Monday afternoon,  June 20, to be shipped to Atlanta, GA. I was distraught when my DHL shipping email was received telling me that the phone was in Hong Kong going through customs Tuesday morning. *sigh*, here we go again, I thought, but figured 'at least I didn't have to wait on an invite'. The phone was delivered yesterday afternoon. Less than 72 hours after placing my order,  I got my phone in hand. Paid no shipping, no tax.  \n\r\nTotally different buying experience. Blown away. I feel like a parent must feel when they realize their baby is grown up. Almost brings a tear to my eye. \r\nMoved all my crap over from the 2 and have been using the hell out of this thing and I can once again,  honestly,  say that I have fallen in love with my phone. It's my second love,  the first being the oneplus one and now the 3. I have no qualms what so ever with this purchase. Awesome device.  Just awesome, everything is as it should be. I have no plans to replace Oxygen or run a custom kernel.  Though I have rooted it for using certain apps I can't live without. Adaway anyone?  \n\r\nI don't usually give any credence to these phone benchmark scores or ranks...  but out of curiosity, I ran an antutu test and have attached the results. keep in mind, I'm totally stock. Rom, kernel, kernel settings like governor and thermal driver settings are all factory.  I just don't see a need anymore, and that's a good thing. \n\r\nAlso,  screens showing battery consumption so far. I use high accuracy location to share my whereabouts in real time with my family, that includes WiFi scanning enabled. Bluetooth is always on and connected to my Moto 360 2nd Gen watch, adaptive brightness enabled, vibration on touch and notification on, single Sim (t-mobile).  \n\r\nAnyways, that's my initial rant on things. Been around awhile, at least in oneplus years and right now I am happy as can be. This phone is a monster. Beautiful,  sleek and cool on the outside,  but down right vicious on the inside. \n\r\nDon't be worried if your on the fence about getting one, it may not be 100% to 100% of everyone, but what is? You won't be disappointed. \n\r\nPeace out my brothers from other mothers.", "time": "24th June 2016, 02:17 PM", "postID": "post67464398", "replies": []}, {"text": "Onelove", "time": "25th June 2016, 03:00 PM", "postID": "post67478232", "replies": []}, {"text": "He lived up to our expectations as a great device, leaving his successor with big shoes to fill.So far the was exactly that.

Sure the screen is not as nice as the s7 but I can live with out that...it's also $300 less! Everything else in my opinion works better, no lag or stutter, super fast, premium build and just beautiful to look at, fast charge thru dash charge (wish it would have been quick charge 2 or 3 as I already have spare chargers), 6 GB of RAM which is more future resistant...not future proof because something better is always around the corner, 64 GB internal is plenty for me, pretty good camera (better lowlight would be preferred but I'm satisfied at this price) and a super fast fingerprint sensor! A 5.5inch 1080p 401ppi screen is perfect in my opinion for both battery consumption and average user. It looks good to me.

Obviously not the RAM difference as the OP3 isn't using all of it's RAM, aside from reviewer releases, this is perhaps a bit lacking for some.  The 820 is a BEAST!  I always wondered why in the recent past they(QC)  decided to use the whole ARM Big/Little setup...  This quad core is, at least seems to be, much faster than previous generation octacores.  Not only in benchmarks but also everyday use. Granted I'm coming from a hexacore, an 808 I believe. \n\nJust goes to show that often times these spec wars are kinda of joke.  Why would an android handset need more than 4 cores? Seriously. Give me 2 - 4 that are fast and energy efficient.  As much as many here hate Apple I have to throw them some props for their A9.  Dual core with only 2Gb of RAM?  Driving that display too?  All the while scoring really well on performance and battery benchmarks! That is some really great software optimization and hardware engineering. \n\nI may be kind of the odd guy out here but I really enjoy the latest iOS experience, its such a well integrated platform. I haven't owned an iPhone since the 4 or 4s(I think) but they have come a long way since then.  Of course I always Jailbroke them whenever possible.  The whole Phandroid/iSheep phenomenon is so odd to me.  They're both excellent platforms with their own limitations,  advantages and quirks. That groups of people literally come out and strongly bash and insult each other over their choice of a mobile phone is so crazy to me.  I mean seriously people, you're gonna be Apple or Google's troll/\"PR\" person? How about everyone just uses what they like to use without this \"mine is better than yours\" mentality. Who are these people trying to convince? Themselves? \n\nHaving said that I've always wondered if I should just pony up a bit more cash for the flagship Nexus device.  I've always been curious if it received the close attention to optimization of the software to the particular hardware it was running on.  That's what has always made me, at the least, respect the iPhone. If it's done right there isn't all that much better than a thoroughly integrated software/hardware package! \n\nSorry for yet another rant but I just couldn't help myself....", "time": "2nd July 2016, 01:03 AM", "postID": "post67567292", "replies": []}, {"text": "The snapdragon 820 is far better than the 810.
