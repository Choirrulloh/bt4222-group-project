I already tried restoring the Phone to factory settings and without any extra apps but the issue persists. It just suddenly started happening (about a month ago).\nNothing has changed in the bluetooth devices that I use with my Phone. I connect my car using Bluetooth and if I'm not in my car, I use a Bluetooth hands free kit to make and receive my Phone calls.\nAbout a month ago my bluetooth started acting weird. When I'm in my car and want to make a Phone call, it starts the call on my Phone but then my car says that something went wrong and the call couldn't be initiated, although the call is continued on my phone. I do receive my text messages on my car and can also sent them but I'm unable to make/receive Phone calls.\nWhen I receive Phone calls, they don't come up on my cars media. However, my Phone says its using Bluetooth for the call and the bluetooth connection is up. When I'm having this issue, I can not disconnect the Bluetooth connection with my car on my phone. It refuses to disconnect and I can not switch to any other Bluetooth device. The same goes when I'm having the issue while connected to my other Bluetooth hands free kit. In the advanced bluetooth settings of the bluetooth connection on my Phone, I also noticed that when the issue occurs all Bluetooth functionality is checked (eg. 'Media audio'), except 'Phone audio'. 'Phone audio' is not checked and it refuses to check it (however it's not greyed out). When I tap on 'Phone audio' in order to enable it, you see it getting checked for like a few microseconds and then it instantly gets unchecked again.\nThe only remedy I found is to power off and start my Phone again. Very frustrating if you want to make a quick Phone call and that you have to wait 5 minutes each time or if someone is trying to reach you but they can't hear you and they keep calling back while you try to press the power off button :-).\nI've noticed that when I keep my Phone powered on at night and let it charge, the issue is present. If I recharge my Phone while it's powered of, pull out the power plug and then power on the Phone, there is no issue.\nIt seems to me that it has something to do with the update process...\nAny idea how I can solve this issue?\nPreviously I did had other bluetooth issues like sudden switches between the phone's speaker and the bluetooth hands free (without any clear reason), it would just switch the bluetooth audio off and on again. So imagine, I'm calling someone with my hands free kit and suddenly the sound is gone. I grab my Phone and hear the other person talking, I continue the conversation using my phone's sound, then the sound is gone again and I need to continue with my handsfree. Other times when the phone said it was using bluetooth audio, it actually wasn't and I had to select 'Phone speaker' and then bluetooth audio again to get audio via bluetooth.\nI don't think it has got anything to do with my car's bluetooth or my handsfree because the handsfree works flawlessly with my laptop and the car's bluetooth also works perfect with my partners Phone.", "time": "04-17-2017 10:28 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5763646", "text": "Welcome to the forums.

But this is not working in Moto X. I tried with native gallery, Photos and all the top line 3rd party apps for this. I can see the pic when i restart the phone and open the app, if i close and reopen its all blank squares only as thumbnails.I formatted the sd card and copied all the pics once again and checked still the same issue.\nIs this a problem of reading from SD card or is it bcos of too many items in one folder. If latter is the case a weaker phone Asus was handling it nicely.\nAnyone could help on this. \nThanks in advance", "time": "12-02-2015 06:38 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4870281", "text": "Welcome to Android Central!

It was predicted to be \u00a3359, but now you can pre-order the Moto X Style off the Motorola store (32 GB, no additional things/covers) for \u00a3399!! This is just too much as it contradicts all the predictions, and it isn't such a good-value-for-money phone as advertised. It also doesn't match up with the exchange rate between pounds and dollars, as the phone costs $399. If the \u00a3399 was to be accurately converted to dollars, it would cost over $600. I have emailed the Motorola support team and I am waiting for a reply.\nHas anyone got any theories/ideas why this has happened?
