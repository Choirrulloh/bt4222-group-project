Every single scenario, except for sunny day, is impossible for this software.

Hard Reset (long press of the power button and volume increase button) does not help either. Charging the device also did not work.

Just in case I tried and with the button of a decrease of a sound, and with the touch button home and with their various combinations.

You'll need to play around in manual yourself to get the hang of it, but you can manually increase ISO to make it more light sensitive and increase shutter speed to reduce blur.\nIf you don't know much about how a camera works, it functions by opening the lens to capture light and create an image. The longer the lens is open, the more light it let's in but any motion caught will blur, and hand shake causing the camera module itself to move makes the entire image appear blurry. \nA fast shutter speed allows the lens to open and close extremely quick freezing motion and preventing blur, this is what sports mode would do. However because it opens and closes so fast, it doesn't get much time to capture light so the sensor needs to increase ISO (light sensitivity) to make up for it. Downside to increased ISO is the lower image quality and digital noise it adds. \nThe exact results vary between cameras so I can't give you specific settings, but just so you know 1/100 is a faster shutter speed than 1/50, it's measured as a fraction of a second.", "time": "09-11-2017 02:04 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5968446", "text": "I can shoot just fine in manual, as I stated.

And it's pretty much like a smaller Mate 9 (which is a good thing to me).\nIt's a phone that gets most of the basics right. Good performance, decent camera, nice design, decent battery life, etc.\nIt's lacking stereo speakers (which i enjoyed on the Mate 9) but it still sounds really good. The bezels are a bit big, but at least there's no camera hump and phone is still really thin. No water resistance which is a bit of a downer. But in Singapore, the price is still quite decent at least (less than 700SGD, or around 500USD). Which is important because the P10 probably wouldn't be able to win the S8, but since it's cheaper, I still think it's a pretty decent option.\nAt this point, I think Samsung is so far ahead of other Android OEMs in terms of hardware that it's going to be difficult to be able to just jump to their level straight away.
