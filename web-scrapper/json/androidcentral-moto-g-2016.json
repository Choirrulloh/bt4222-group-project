Been taking and uploading images for years. Then after automatic download of 10.25.1 middle of this month, the image would look focused when I look at it on the screen, but blurred after snapping it. \nFiguring my phone was bad, I ported over to an identical G4 that Motorola sent back as a warranty replacement (mine went bad, warranty would take too long, so I paid for a new one, and eventually got a second new one back from Motorola/Lenovo). \nLoaded Instagram on the second G4, same thing. So I began to experiment. If I take the photo using camera, no blur. Seems to be something about the recent release.\nCurious, I then downloaded Instagram to a 3rd phone, a Moto G4+ that is my overseas phone (travel a lot, so I don't swap out sim cards, but instead keep overseas sim cards in additional phones). With either sim card, it gave clear shots using Instagram. So it suggests some conflict between the Moto G4 and something in the new release of Instagram.\nHas anyone experienced the same thing?

My phone has been in a case since January, so it's been pretty safe. The vibration will only work on my phone if I bang the palm of my hand around my camera area. If I l remove my hand away from the area I banged my palm on or around, the vibration will stop till I bang it again. About a week ago, the vibration came back on by it's self, but after an hour, it went back to not working. My keyboard does not work either on vibration, nothing does. No vibration for notifications, not a thing. My headphone jack also seemed to have messed up a bit after that happened too. I am in desperation of help to get this fixed. This phone is 2 months old. I have a Moto G4 Play. I cannot return it from where I got it from, because I only had a 14 day return. PLEASE HELP ME!

Not a valid reason. \nI can install the nook reader app, for instance, and it will allow me to install all my books onto the sdcard. The Kindle app, on the other hand, will not allow you to store YOUR books on YOUR sdcard because they fear piracy. There's nothing organic about the Kindle app that makes it impossible to store the books to the sdcard, just a stupid developer attempt to limit your use of your own books. Music apps and music are similar. If I go with the basic system and install just the bare bones of what I actually USE on my phone, then try to install a couple music apps with the music to go with it (in my case, not a huge number of songs, just those I like to listen to at the gym) I very quickly run out of system memory. So, I install apps2sd and move all of it to my sdcard so there's plenty of room for the base apps AND for my music. It is a must.\nThe most recent android itself has moved towards allowing integration of external memory into \"internal\" memory for this very reason: the problem of user memory running out very quickly for so many people. The fact that some (many) apps don't allow you to simply select to install to the card is purely a developer choice, not a system requirement for function. \nHere's the biggest deal. My phone has 4GB of internal storage. The Android OS is using 3.47GB of that. See the problem? The OS itself is hogging 87% of my system memory before I add anything to the phone! \nBut thanks for the reply anyway. I'll stick with using MY device and MY apps as I want, and NEED, to use them.", "time": "12-31-2016 12:52 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5627220", "text": "Which Moto G is this?", "time": "12-31-2016 01:47 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5627812", "text": "Moto G 3rd Gen.

My Sony Blueray player sometimes accepts it and when it does it is very laggy. Mostly I use a Microsoft HD-10 to cast to which works most of the time. Sometimes it will lag, but not nearly as bad as the other one, I just pause the video I'm watching and that normally fixes it.\nFor Netflix and Hulu, I've resorted to popping my sim into my Lumia 735 and that works really well for casting.", "time": "09-23-2016 08:44 AM", "replies": []}]}]
