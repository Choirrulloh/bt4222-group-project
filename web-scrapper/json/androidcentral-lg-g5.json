I can still get service via LTE Bands 2 and 4, but we have a piece of family property where the only service available is via LTE Band 17.\nAround the same time I bought my wife a new ZTE Axon 7 Mini. She is rocking Android 7.1 and gets full LTE Band 17 connectivity. My in-laws have much older, crappier phones and both get LTE Band 17.\nI bought the G5 due to the fact it is advertised as being LTE Band 17 capable. Seriously.

When it decides it doesn't want to be an LTE phone anymore, suddenly all 4 LTE signals disappear from the app, completely, and all it wants to do is show me a couple of weak \"H\" signals.

It seems that AT&T only allows whitelisted phones on their LTE network, if they're unrecognized or unlocked, they are unknown and limited to GSM HSPA/HSPA+. Some workarounds are to first activate your phone on an AT&T branded phone then swap the SIM to a phone of your choice. I've heard you can also contact AT&T and ask them to add your phone to an LTE whitelist (first explain the issue). This has happened on several flagship phones like OnePlus, Nexus, Huawei, and unlocked variants. This would make sense, as I activated my AT&T SIM (through TracFone) on an LG G3 VS985 (Verizon model) which at least supports LTE bands 2 and 4. I also recall I seldom ever got LTE unless it was a fresh reboot, and again calling dropped me down to 3G but I assumed it was because it was a Verizon variant. Three months later I switched to the LG G3 D850 AT&T variant and remember I always had LTE even after dialing. I upgraded to the LG G4 H811 unlocked, and noticed the LTE dropping again. At this point I thought it was a hardware failure but then now I see this is an actual limitation set by AT&T. I then upgraded to the LG G5 RS988 with this same exact LTE dropping issue. By then I switched to Verizon through TracFone, and my MEID was denied and marked incompatible, even though Verizon's site said my \"LG G5 RS988 Unlocked\" phone was compatible on their network, as a last resort I tried the IMEI and activation proceeded. I have the same issues with the LTE dropping here as before on AT&T's towers though not always. Again this leads me to believe that both AT&T and Verizon highly limit access to their network and LTE especially for non-carrier phones. Maybe my MEID needs to be added to Verizon's whitelist now.\nIt has been successful for AT&T users on the OnePlus, Nexus, and Huawei to call in AT&T, go through several uninformed reps, and finally reach a higherup tech to \"add\" the IMEI to their whitelist which can take 2-3 weeks to take effect (achieve full LTE support). \nI will update with my success (if any) with TracFone and see what they can do, I may have to go back to the AT&T towers and SIM.\nSources:https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/com...get_lte_on_att https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/comment...ct_to_lte_only https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/comment...in_the_us_withhttps://forums.oneplus.net/threads/n...problems.54445", "time": "03-11-2018 11:04 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Fingerprint options missing", "thread": [{"postID": "post5195180", "text": "I love the fingerprint scanner on this phone, and it is usually how I unlock it.

Everything worked, and then Nougat was pushed out. Once I loaded it with Nougat, I immediately ceased connecting to LTE Band 17, which my network (Cricket) uses. I can still get service via LTE Bands 2 and 4, but we have a piece of family property where the only service available is via LTE Band 17.\nAround the same time I bought my wife a new ZTE Axon 7 Mini. She is rocking Android 7.1 and gets full LTE Band 17 connectivity. My in-laws have much older, crappier phones and both get LTE Band 17.\nI bought the G5 due to the fact it is advertised as being LTE Band 17 capable. Seriously. There are a few other phones I was considering. One or two didn\u2019t have LTE Band 17 antennas, and I took them off my list. One that I should have gotten instead was the Motorola G5 Plus. Seriously should have pulled the trigger on that one. But, I wanted to avoid a Chinese \u2013 Lenovo phone.\nNow, after contacting LG numerous times and being told I can turn it in for repair, only for it to be sent back to me on Nougat (meaning no LTE Band 17), I have a paper weight while away at the property with family. Its quite a shame seeing I have the most technologically advanced phone out of the group. \nI was told LG was working on an update. Looks like that update was a security update only. No help to me.\nNow I have to wait to see if Oreo, if we ever get it, will fix my issue. \nI have checked all my settings. Done numerous resets and factory restores, etc. I have contacted Cricket. I have searched online for answers. I am not the only one with LTE Band 17 connectivity issues.\nI wish LG would stand by the product and service and admit there may be an issue, and try and push an update to fix it. Should be a simple fix. Nougat killed LTE Band 17. Should be a simple re-write to have the software turn it back on.\nWont be going back to LG. Will likely end up upgrading shortly to a competitor.

I've had it for 7 months now and it hasn't loat a bit of speed or responsiveness. I'm fine with the cameras though clearly they've made a quantum leap since, from everything I've read about the V30 (which I drool about!) but these cameras are awesome, especially the \"std\" 16 mp with amazing manual mode and, honestly, totally kick-butt auto performance, both stills and videos. I also have found the wide angle mode to be far more than a gimmick, enabling me to take shots that just would not have recorded pieces of my personal history without, fisheye or no fisheye! From the 15 or so reviews Ive seen of the V30, they've really made the wide angle feature in league with a 28mm DSLR now.\nOne unsung feature of the G5 I really appreciate is the high loudness of its internal speaker. Small feature but so often made playing youtubes to a small group possible when 90% of other phones just don't get loud enough.\nBattery life is disappointing to me, and it will cause me to replace this sooner than I otherwise would. I though the interchangeable feature would make the far less than day-long endurance bearable, but inevitably I find I'm virtually out of juice at a totally inconvenient time to switch out (and put the near-dead one in the charging \"casket\" and plug it un, etc) I have learned a lot of techniques to stretch times; it's just the one issue that makes this phone feel like a compromise, not the high-luxe flagship it otherwise fully is.\nIf you can get past the battery issue, however, new ones are still available on Swappa for around $175, truly a steal for a truly lovely, powerful smartphone with a gorgeous screen and a 1st class camera.\nLast thought: I never thought the modular design was a silly gimmick - I just wish there was a single module ever released for use on U. S. versions! It certainly wasnt a disadvantage though. The other thing that people panned this phone for - its \"nongmetallic looking finish - is to me a virtue. It doesn't gather fingerprints like the glass-covered backs of the Samsung and Apple\" pretty \" phones, and it looks stylish and sophisticated. Oh well, can't please everyone!

I know the V20 is as capable but I'm going thru a learning curve and am getting the hang of it finally. \nI don't get it. The complaints about the fingerprint sensor on the back (the best spot imho) and how the phone had to be picked up to unlock it. (Try doubletapping the screen moron!) But now some phones not only must you pick it up but now you need to look at it a certain way to unlock it. But that's not only acceptable now but also cool? I don't think so. Not to mention coming up with at least $1300 first to get that feature (I live in Canada.) \nI think the finish was one of the best features of the G5. It was great to hold and was not a magnet for all the other crap. Yes! Other phones are very pretty in comparison but seriously.

If I'm taking a picture indoors, and there is light coming through a window, it makes the photo very washed out, where as my sons note 8, has no issues at all with the same scenario. My problem, and it is a good one to have, is that I got the G5 for AT&T last Feb, for $5 a month at BB (with a spare battery and Charger) When I look at upgrading, I just can't justify the cost, for the minor upgrades that I would get from one of the latest and greatest phones.

I don't replace phones very often, and the Nexus was the only one I've had in years that didn't have a swappable battery (even back in my pre-Android Palm days!).\nAn easily replaceable battery, with offline charger, is just so much simpler as a way to keep your phone running than hunting for plugins, or carrying a charger pack. I've never understood why the majority of phone owners just don't get it!\nI got mine SIM-free, and use a cheap monthly SIM-only deal (UK).\nAnyway, I like just about everything about the G5, including the external SD card and twin cameras (not perfect, but I'm not a perfectionist in photography - I'd have a Nikon or Canon if I was). I even picked up a Cam+ cheap which does make the phone easier to use as a camera. But there is one glaring exception - GPS.\nThe GPS signal reception is really sub-standard, and I've spent a lot of time messing with it, even buying a cheap broken G5 to play at swapping parts. Fortunately the G5 is really easy to open and tweak (another of it's good points). I've concluded the GPS signal issue is a design flaw. The main antenna is actually on the front, under the screen top-right, and works perfectly if you run the phone with the back off. But bringing the metallic back within a few millimetres of that antenna kills it, obviously a design oversight. :-(\nAs a result there is an extra pressure contact on the antenna track that connects with a pad on the back, all looks very like an afterthought. It kinda works, but the efficiency of that extra contact seems questionable, and the signal is never as good as with the back off, and is probably very noisy so the GPS performance is erratic. I've improved things a bit with judicious use of copper foil and conductive glue, but it's still not good.\nIt's a great shame, and spoils what in all other respects is a really nice phone.

Nova is the admin, using gesture lock with Prime launcher will lock the phone but the issue is when Nova locks the screen via gesture fingerprint doesn't work from the OS.

Either Nova or OS but it seems not both. I have uninstalled, rebooted, and tried OS as screen admin, which takes away from Prime as a launcher for knock or any gesture and this issue exists. The only way that gesture lock works correctly for fingerprint scanner is with the Marshmallow OS. If I gesture lock using Prime I have to unlock with my OS code. Seems to me Nova needs to find a way to allow the program to integrate somewhat to allow screen gesture lock to depend on the phone OS.

The customer service rep told me that this model will not be receiving the Nougat update because the push would have to come from AT&T, which I suspected. As a non-contract service Tracfone only provides my minutes/text/data and does not deal with software updates. I read also that AT&T will not be providing the update to non-contract carrier phones. Bummer. I am still within the time limit to return my LG G5 and am seriously considering doing so. I hesitate somewhat because I now have Google Assistant, which is very handy plus I'm reading that the cameras on my LG G5 are actually better than those on some of the newer flagship phones, and then there is the replaceable battery. Arrrgh. Not sure what I should do but I have until April 4 to either return or exchange my LG G5. For what it's worth I saw several comments on LG's reviews by customers who also stated that the unlocked LG G5 would not be updated. On the other hand, as long as I am on Tracfone I will always be dealing with this situation which is why I want to find a phone I can live with for a long time even if it doesn't get yearly updates.

My experience may not apply to everyone posting here, but LG, Best Buy and Tracfone have confirmed that the rs988 will not be receiving the Nougat update. Tracfone, like other non-contract providers is obligated to provide my minutes/text/data which they do very nicely for a very cheap price. Although Tracfone rents AT&T towers that does not obligate AT&T to provide software updates to non-contractual users and I believe that is their position. I realize now that the 2017-01-01 security patch I received on my LG G5 was exactly that, a security update and I seem to have received Google Assistant through my recent app updates. For some silly reason I thought that meant I was on the way to the Nougat update but my phone was simply receiving the app updates it normally receives. Having used the LG G5 for over a week now I think I'm going to keep it. I have not had one problem with the phone so it has proved \"sea worthy\" so to speak and as my husband wisely asked me, what exactly do you use a cell phone for and I have to admit it is basically phone calls, some web surfing and emails which the LG G5 handles very well, plus the microsd card I installed is functioning perfectly for storing photos, etc. I have also seen many reviews that are saying the cameras on some of the newer models are not as good as the ones I have on the LG G5. Bottom line is, as long as I am using Tracfone I will not be receiving Android software updates outside of app updates, security, etc. and I can live with that. Can't justify high monthly contract fees when Tracfone and the LG G5 are giving me exactly what I need. For serious cell phone updaters that may understandably be too restrictive. If someone gets info contrary to what I have posted I will be happy to read it.

[{"title": "LG G5 v Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X", "thread": [{"postID": "post5959484", "text": "I moved from BlackBerry to the LG G5, pre-ordering it and getting quite excited about a flagship phone and apps! Within two weeks the phone was back at LG for repair (faulty GPS) and again a week after that (they hadn't repaired the GPS) and then for two months it waited for a new mobo. LG couldn't source one as apparently it was selling so well and had no spares. Eventually it came back and had a faulty screen, back it went and unsurprisingly it came back unrepaired with LG then basically refusing to repair it. O2 refunded me the full price at this stage, however I'd bought the phone for a 2 month cycle trip ironically to Korea and with it being in its 2 month holiday at LG's repair centre I foolishly bought another G5 to take with me which would hopefully then become my wife's phone. We liked this phone for its wide angle camera - lightweight and useful for cycling.\nThe second Phones camera cover broke when it was siting on a table in Korea, heat perhaps? Then when we got back it started to overheat, repeatedly. Just browsing the Web would take it up go 65C and beyond. Of course by then the warranty had run out and we'd had enough of the Life's Good if you don't buy our phones company.\nWe then decided to go cheap and cheerful and bought the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X international version with all the 4G bands for the UK. What a difference between the two Phones! The Xiaomi is faster than either of my G5's, runs cool doing anything and the battery lasts well past a day of heavy use. The cameras poor in low light though. It's system menus are more in depth with useful info such as what apps are using bandwidth, battery percent etc. The menus take some getting used to though! Memory management is good and I rarely get into the 3rd Gb of RAM.\nIt's been updated twice OTA already and a third is due at the end of September I believe. I'm impressed.\nThe fingerprint reader - another area on my G5 that was often hit and miss - is very quick and reliable and the whole phone zips along as if it has the faster chip, not the G5.\nThe only bug bear I can't seem to resolve is the notification bar at the top of the screen not showing temperatures from accuweather but just the accuweather icon. It's not a deal breaker and perhaps it's just my not finding the right setting.\nHowever, It also only cost just over \u00a3100 and it's a huge bargain fun to use, never lags and such a relief after my LG nightmares.", "time": "09-06-2017 09:07 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "My LG G5 suddenly stopped charging/won't even turn on.", "thread": [{"postID": "post5957245", "text": "Hey everyone,\nlooking for some help with my LG G5 (european version, so I guess that would be the unlocked version in the US?). I have the phone for about a year, never had any problems with it, until yesterday that is. No modifications done to it, no root, nothing. So, to get to the problem, yesterday in the evening I was out and about and my phone was kind of low on battery (the battery has never been changed, so the capacity is lower from the use and so on), after a few hours the phone shut down at around 15-20% which is also normal for me. I didn't notice it at first, I just thought it shut down for some reason, tried to boot it up, it went into a boot loop because of the low battery, so I switched it off so it wouldn't get to 0%. When I got home, plugged it in, it started up, was at 13%, then I went to the bathroom, when I got back, the phone was off for some reason, I started it up again, no problem with the starup, showed it was at 15% and after like a minute it shut down and from that point I can't get it to start. I mean not even show signs of life, no logo showing, no bootup screen, no vibration, nothing. Today I tried just about everything I could to repair it, took it apart, cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol, tried multiple chargers, cables, even tried a different than the default module( I got the B and O music module) and I even bought a new battery, because I thought the old one was dead.

How HTC messed that up is beyond me.\nI feel they are about even on system responsiveness and the cameras are close but I give the edge to the G5 and use the wide angle a lot. It's just another thing that's nice to have. \nI also appreciate the lighter frame of the G5 and the build materials are holding up well so far.

Yeah the friends modules were a dud but as a phone this thing stands on its own.\nWith the G6 and V30 moving to non-removable batteries...the G5 is the last of its breed. \nThe G6 is coming down in price fast thanks to low demand so I figure I could scoop one of those up in a few months for cheap.

There are 2 big issues I have with the LG G5 RS988. The people who buy the unlocked version are usually the true fans who are loyal to LG. The unlocked version usually can unlock the bootloader because there is no carrier controlling LG and are also usually the first to get updates because there is no carrier to add bloatware to the phone. However, the RS988 owners are being treated like second class citizens. The T Mobile version can unlock the bootloader but not the RS988 version. The carrier versions (ATT, Verizon, etc) are now getting the Nougat update, but the RS988 has not yet. Why did I pay full price for an unlocked version only to be treated as a second class citizen? The true LG fans are online defending LG when Samsung S7 users are bashing the LG G5, but once you lose their loyalty, they will likely switch to Samsung or Apple and you will lose their support. As LG does not have the same market share as Samsung and Apple, how can you not care about keeping the loyalty of your true fans, the ones who will defend you online? I hope the management at LG gets this message. Please listen to your customers because they will speak with their wallet the next time they buy a phone and LG will lose even more market share.\"\nThe more channels we use to voice our opinions, the more likely they will listen.", "time": "12-29-2016 06:45 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5625585", "text": "Hey @Bostski, thanks for taking the time to do this.

Reading through many forums it appears that virtually every other variant of the LG G5 has already received this update. As my phone is not tied to any particular US carrier, I have no recourse to acquire the Android 7 update from a source other than LG. While other phone manufacturers have already started rolling out updates to the initial Android 7 release, I and other LG G5 (RS988) owners have yet to receive the initial Android 7 update.\nHow can a corporation such as LG ignore an entire segment of their customer base by not updating their phone operating system to the latest version while continuing to tout even newer version of phones they have created and released.\nI would hate to think that I made a $500+ mistake in buying what was at the time LG's latest flagship phone but more and more it appears that is the case. My son purchased an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S7 the same time I purchased my LG G5 (as well as a G5 for my wife) and he has had no problem receiving the Android 7 update from Samsung. Perhaps I will need to rethink the loyalty to LG I have had for the past six years and move to a company that cares to provide promised updates to their phone's software.\nPlease provide me with information on when I will receive the Android 7 (or better yet the most recent version of the Android operating system) for my LG G5 (RS988)\n--", "time": "05-05-2017 12:06 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5802068", "text": "Nice i like it", "time": "05-05-2017 12:11 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5802306", "text": "Thank you for contacting LG Email support services and we really appreciate your e-mail!

I was looking into just soldiering through the unpredictable battery until the next Moto X release but that is a ways a way still. \nI had thought about tracking a G5 down a bit ago to just try out the whole APT-x Bluetooth thing for curiosity's sake as I have the LG Platinum tones ($50 refurbs, I'm not crazy enough to pay full) and there are virtually no other devices that supports APT-x; a new G5 came up for $290 so I took the leap. \nBefore I came across my first Moto phone, the Moto X 2013, I was a massive spec. *****; I bought phones only their performance numbers. The Moto X was an eye opener and I've had both generations and a second gen.

I tend to like TPU only cases with some flair, either in design or color. This is essentially just a clear TPU case but with a shiny color plastic bumper. The bumper is nice and snug so it feels like it's part of the case and not a separate piece. Even when removing the case the bumper doesn't come loose. It's not slim like some of the other cases people have posted. The size is pretty average as far as TPU cases go. All the ports and sensors have good access. It goes right up to the fingerprint scanner. Plenty of room to plug in headphones, but the ones I have are angled so they don't interfere with cases. I took a couple of pics to make sure the case doesn't interfere with the wide angle camera and I haven't seen any issues. The LG supplied USB C cable fits in the port but it is snug. It's like they molded it to that specific design. The LG micro usb adapter fits with plenty of space since it's smaller. That worries me a bit since I just ordered a couple of micro usb adapters and a spare USB C cable from Anker, so hopefully there's no interference there. My only complaint so far is that it's REALLY easy to hit the covered volume buttons, even just by gripping the area around them. I've already hit them multiple times and accidentally taken pictures. I may try filing the nubs inside the volume cover and see if that makes it better. \nI also ordered one of those clear Vena cases as a back up but it hasn't come yet.", "time": "04-20-2016 02:19 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5141762", "text": "The Vena clear case came in today.

All the ones on the top and bottom of the phone are off center a bit but the holes are large enough where they don't cause any issues. The official LG USB C cable fits easily into the phone. None of the case touches it. The back has a large cutout that goes around the fingerprint sensor and cameras with plenty of space around them so there's no interference. The volume button covers don't have the tabs on the inside so it's difficult to accidentally hit them. You have to press firmly and you can actually feel the volume buttons click when you touch them. The sides of the TPU don't quite come over the face of the phone, which is a hallmark of a cheap TPU case, but in this case it's not loose at all since the back is hard. My clear back has a small blemish in the acrylic though. It's clearly warped in the middle of the acrylic, so that sucks.

(I know this because I was one of those people.) \nThe phone is set up so that it has to be answered by swiping across a circle. Sounds simple enough, but many of us seem to have issues with the phone responding to the swipe, which results in the calls going unanswered even after several attempts.\nI didn't find a definitive answer online or in the manual. However, I (finally) did figure it out, so here are the results. \n(The following is for an AT&T version of the phone. Your menu may differ, but hopefully it is close enough.)\nStep 1:\nSettings > General > Accessibility > Motor & cognition > Touch and hold for calls \n-Turn this feature \"on.\" \nThat might be enough. But if that doesn't quite work for you as you would like, then this optional second step may help.\nStep 2:\nSettings > General > Accessibility > Motor & cognition > Touch input > Ignore repeated taps\nThis will lead to a screen that offers the options of \"Reset\" or \"Adjust\" -- choose \"Adjust\".\nAfter that, a series of circles will appear. Tap each of the circles a few times each. The idea here is to program the handset's sensitivity so that you can tap something a few times and have it interpreted as a single tap. \nYou may need to use trial and error to adjust this in a way that suits you.\nI hope that this helps.

Do a few tests of the cellular in different parts of your home and maybe a few just outside.

Just offhand it sounds like since moving to your new home (congrats BTW on surviving the move from one house to another) you're just marginally far enough away from the closest tower that your G5 is having this problem. If you can get a decent cable or DSL connection you might want to think about using WiFi calling solutions when you're at home. Another option is to get a cell booster (also know as a femtocell). A cell booster is a little box that acts as a mini-cellular access point, made for consumer use so it's coverage range is typically limited. A good one is relatively pricey though but a lot of people have reported their carrier often just picks up the cost if you talk your way into it. So give Verizon a call, ask really nicely or 'suggest' you're close to just bailing on Verizon to use another carrier and see if you get a deal on one.

The build quality of this phone is awful - it feels like a cheap $99 plastic phone. The removable module at the bottom of the phone is unevenly lined up with the main part of the phone, leaving a noticeably uneven gap. The chamfer/edges of the phone feel sharp, not polished like they should be, almost like they could cut your hand (though they won't). The G5 feels cheap in hand, and it looks cheap. My expectations about the build quality were already lowered from videos I've watched the last couple of days, but the bar still wasn't low enough.\nThe other awful decision - the launcher! They removed the app drawers, in favor of an iPhone-like launcher experience. Yuck. And for the apps that you can't disable, the only way to \"hide\" them is to place them into a folder on one of the home screens. Not a great solution. There is an \"easy home\" option, which gives you back the app drawers, but doesn't allow you to add widgets or otherwise customize the home screens. I don't know what they were thinking, but you have to install something like Nova Launcher to get anything close to a true Android UI experience. Bottom line, their launcher is dumbed down, and I don't know why.\nThat said, there are some things I like about the phone - the screen is nice. Good color and sharpness. The cameras are nice (took a couple of photos at normal angle and wide angle), though not really any better than the S7 Edge and iPhone 6s Plus. I like the always-on display a little better than the S7/S7 Edge implementation. And the performance seems good, with the UI being very smooth with no lag.\nAfter using it for a few hours, two main thoughts come to mind - \"disappointment\" and \"compromise\". The build quality and UI design are very disappointing, and inexcusable in 2016, when there are so many phones (even cheaper mid-range selections) with much better build quality. Even LG's own V10 has a much better build quality. I feel like they compromised the phone by focusing on the modular \"friends\" aspect of the G5, instead of the making sure the basics of the phone itself are polished. How many people are really going to buy a G5, and then purchase any of the modular add-ons? And from what I've read, depending on what country you are in, you may not be able to get some of the modules anyway.\nI apologize that this post comes across as so very negative. I'm just hoping to add another point-of-view backing up some of the YouTube reviews we've all seen. Additionally, I've owned a number of different phones over the years, and this ranks as one of the worst I've ever used. I just hope that LG is working on the V20, and doesn't handicap that phone with useless gimmicks that compromise the basics of the phone, as they've done with the G5.\nAs for my G5... I will be returning it to Verizon.

If LG had knocked it out of the part with a brilliantly designed device with a smooth, powerful UI, great cameras, and a fantastic build, does anyone really think there would be as much disappointment as there has been with the G5? Of course not - people would flock to that device. Sure, you'd still get the few hard-core fanboys complaining about some trivial issue with the G5, but that's not what we have here. There are very legitimate reasons to be disappointed with the G5, especially after LG did such a great job with the V10.\nPersonally, I'm platform and OEM-agnostic. I have an iPhone 6s Plus that I use for work, and a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge that is my personal device. I love both equally, and sometimes swap SIMs between them, depending on my mood. However, they are very different devices - OS, screen technology, design philosophy, open vs closed ecosystem. Big differences between the two. But there are elements that they have in common that draws people to them - - fantastic build quality, great cameras, great battery life, smooth operation, great-looking screens. Samsung and Apple take very different roads to get there, but they both arrive at the same location with regards to getting the important things right.\nThis is where the G5 fails. It got some of those core elements right - cameras are great, the screen looks great, and operation is smooth. However, they failed miserably with one of those important core elements: build quality and fit/finish. Perhaps the issue is with the first batches of the G5 coming off the assembly line, but even so, it's still looks bad compared to Apple and Samsung, who seem to have better, more consistent quality control and the ability for the first devices coming out of the factory to look as good as the most recent ones coming off the assembly line. LG has to fix this, and gain this consistency of QC.\nI returned my G5, but I have to admit that there are elements of the device I really like - the wide-angle camera is really cool to have (though I wish it were at least 12MP instead of 8MP). And the screen, despite being an LCD, is really nice to look at it in most situations (still not as good as Apple and Samsung in direct sunlight). Battery life seemed OK. But the thing that killed it for me was the inconsistent quality control. The G5 felt cheap, and the uneven gap at the bottom where the battery module is connected was too much to just ignore. Perhaps I might get one again from a future batch, because I do like the other elements enough to still want one. But right now, it's hard to recommend the G5 over other devices like the S7/Edge.

I don't always stick to one OEM since there's bound to be a phone that meets my needs if the next phone from the OEM that made my current phone doesn't meet my needs. Here's my device history.\nNexus One --> Samsung Galaxy S2 --> Samsung Galaxy S3 --> HTC One (M7) --> LG G3 --> LG G4 --> Samsung Galaxy Note 6?\nI don't stick with one brand for long. I left the Nexus line because later devices didn't have microSD card support. I left Samsung because their software layer was just unbearable and a performance mess at the time. I left HTC because the camera wasn't up to snuff and I left LG because the quality issues with the G4's hardware was just puzzling to me.\nThat might sound negative, but actually, those are only MY reasons why I left these OEMs and it's based on my usage pattern. I want a phone with expandable storage, great performance, a superb camera, all while being a reliable device. In fact, here are the reasons why I used phones from those OEMs.\nI used the Nexus because as an Android newcomer, I'd like to see how Android by itself performs. I then went to Samsung to experience Android skins and experiment with evolving smartphone hardware. I went with HTC because they were really making a name for themselves in terms of build quality and sound. I then went with LG because they seem to be pretty serious about catering towards power-users.\nAnd I don't leave them for very long. In fact, I'm returning to Samsung because they addressed the performance issues, bloatware and other issues I had starting with the S6 and the subsequent Note 5 and especially the S7 refined them to the point where I'm actually considering returning to them. If HTC puts a great camera on the 10 and LG ups their quality-control on the V10 successor and the G6, I'll likely be going back to either one of them in the future.", "time": "04-08-2016 05:48 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5112207", "text": "Motorola F3 Black\nSony Ericsson j230i Orange\nMotorola RAZR Gunmetal Gray\nSony Ericsson t250i Black\nNokia xpress music 5530 Blue\nNokia x3 Silver \nNokia c3 Blue\nIPhone 3gs White\nIPhone 4 Black\nIPhone 5 White \nSamsung Galaxy note 3 White\nGoogle nexus 5 White\nLG G2 white \nHTC one m8 Gunmetal Gray\nSony xperia z3 Black\nSony xperia z2 Black\nMotorola Droid Turbo Black\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 White\nLG G4 brown leather\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Gold Platinium \nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge Emerald Green\nThis is my phone log \nYes I'm crazy. \nBut I see that when people use more OEMS they have a better knowledge of what companies are doing wrong and what they're doing right.

If you were to use the phone with the screen on continuously, I suspect you'd get closer to 5 hours of SOT or more, because there'd be no contribution from idle time -- but then, the total time on battery before you had to charge would be the same as your SOT.

The stock auto-adjust is almost twice as bright as you'd need at nearly all times when indoors. \nAlso, the screen isn't quite as nice as an iPhone or Samsung. Most people can't even tell but I'm a stickler. It has a noticeably cool color hue and the contrast is only OK, making whites slightly bluish and blacks slightly grayish when compared to the other screens.

I don't break my phones much so I only really upgrade them when they're slow. Because of that, replacing the battery when it loses its full capacity instead of having to replace the whole phone is a big plus for me. Also, the excellent charging speed makes it not much of an issue, and the fact that my phone is never on a cord to charge is also a big positive. I only charge batteries, when my phone is low, I simply swap the battery instead of plugging it in. \nAs for the screen, it's still very vivid, bright, crisp, and responsive.

I had a coworker with me when doing this, we both had a brain malfunction.\nThe fact is I used up all the 10 retries.\nThen I went to Orange service and they informed me that the baseboard is locked and cannot be reflashed, but instead it must be replaced and it costs $200.\nIs that true? Perfectly working hardware has to be replaced because of a human error while inputting data in a field? No reflash possible, no reset? What kind of colossal paranoid made this design decision? Is it because of the carrier (Orange) or because of LG?\nPlease enlighten me, mobile gurus.", "time": "12-29-2016 05:49 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "I now want an LG G5", "thread": [{"postID": "post5296204", "text": "Hello all. Here we are in the middle of 2016, and I've decided to step up from my G3 to the G5...I went for a visit to www.versus.com and compared the leading devices (Galaxy S7 Edge, HTC 10, Moto Z Force) against the G5.

I know build quality has been an issue, so I'll look mine over, but normally have a thin case on it.

Launching the camera would take a good 5-10 seconds, and my battery was depleting at very quick speed - a full charge would depleat around 3-4 hours. I also couldn't do quick charge - a full charge was around 3 hours according to the battery usage estimate. Since I was travelling when I did the upgrade I thought I had damaged the cord or the charger, I ended up replacing both of them twice ( one was knock off charger and cable, and the second was from a more reputable brand). I also bought the spare battery and charging cradle since I couldn't be tethered to power to use the phone.\nAfter arriving at a friend's house , I did some initial research and I came across a post where someone had described their issues and they resolved it by uninstalling the next launcher. I was using this launcher as well, so I uninstalled the launcher ... And immediately my phone battery life improved 100 folds. It was performing better than what I had previously, even before the update and the quick charging was working again.\nHowever I still have some sluggish behaviour when I go to recent apps, or when I switch from front camera to rear camera. But the general camera loading speed is near what I had prior to the update. I'm not sure what I can do to resolve this, I might do a factory reset when I get back home.\nI'm also not a great fan of the quick settings, I think the white and small icons make it look a little too bare. I would have preferred slightly larger icons to fill up the space.\nI tried the multi window a couple of times, however I don't know if I'm going to use this as regularly as some other people.

It work fine with my laptop when I use the usb A connector. My phone have the camplus module connected and I tried to connect the type c connector of the Ultra Dual USB Drive to my LG G5 and I realise the phone was unable to recognize it or even detect it. So after sometime I figure out that the problem is most likely the CamPlus so i swapped the module with the original phone connector (the components with speaker only). Now the LG G5 is able to detect the USB drive but it is quite intermittent and the USB Drive can get ejected randomly. I also downloaded the Sandisk Memory Zone App and the application was not able to detect the USB drive. I tried es file manager too but it is also unable to detect the flash drive. The only file manager that works is the build-in LG's file manager and as I mention previously the USB drive can get ejected randomly the build-in LG's file manager is only able to detect the USB drive when it is successfully mounted. On some lucky occasion when the USB drive is mounted successfully, I am able to see the thumbnail of the content inside the USB drive but I am unable to play any video from the USB drive.\nI tried the Sandisk Ultra Dual USB Drive Type-C on my Zenfone 3 which also have a USB type c connector port. Initially, when I plugged in the USB drive into my Zenfone 3 said something about unrecognized format and suggest me to format it on the phone. I followed the onscreen instruction and format the USB drive, now the USB drive works flawlessly on my Zenfone 3. \nNext, I tried to used the formatted USB drive on my LG G5 but the same issue that I encounter previously on the LG G5 still persist.\nDoes anyone have any idea LG phone only able to recognize sd card instead of USB drive? Had anyone encountered my problem before and know the work around or perhaps anyone have some idea how to fix it? I am also not really sure why is the LG G5 only able to view the content the build-in LG's file manager. Thanks for reading this long post.

Coming from the LG G4 to the LG V10 and landing on the LG G5 does not feel like a necessary update. Don't get me wrong LG is my top favorite Android Smartphone maker. I have used almost various devices from flagships, mid-range and low-end devices as my my daily driver. \nThe V10 is the top most personal favorite of mine followed by the Galaxy Note 5 and so on. \nComing back to the LG G5 which is a personally anticipated device which I finally received almost a month from me writing here. \nReally happy with the size as it easily fits the palm of my hand. Personally I did not care much about the So-Called poor built quality as mine felt fine and used to get cold whenever the AC was turned on ( But not as cold as the HTC 10 which was exactly my previous device).\nWas not really happy about the display which is one of the main reason this phone is ALMOST a NO for me. It was one of the dimmest displays I have seen. I usually am very happy with 25-30% brightness on all my other phones and tablets but this one is so dark which makes it really Annoying and BAD. But thats not the worst SCREEN BLEED, GHOST SCREEN. Etc. are very frequent visitors in my G5 especially with a bit of YouTube. And thats REALLY BAD. At times it gets really frustrating especially when none of my 51 phones had this issue. I tried a couple of apps and YouTube videos to kill the ghost screen but its a temporary solution and this disease will hit back really soon. P. S if any one has found a permanent fix for this issue please comment below. \nOKAY, I was very impressed with the battery especially the stand-by. WOW. This could easily have the best Standby time after the iPhone 6. And the battery was actually GOOD as well. Used to get around 6 hours of non stop usage. P. S.

Not good for my smaller than average hands or pocketability.\n2) Added a secondary camera instead of massively improving low light quality on the primary rear camera. All the signs point to the main G5 camera being the same F1.8 aperture unit as last year, which is by no means a bad thing but I feel it's going to be outdone by Samsung's brand new camera sensor in low light situations and focusing speed.\n3) Smaller battery. Yes, yes it's removable. But I'm the kinda guy who likes to carry less in my pockets not more, so I'd rather carry the larger-batteried Galaxy S7 or S7 edge than the G5 + a spare battery. \nBonus reasons: Water resistance IP68 and wireless charging support that the G5 lacks.\nThis is just my opinion.

Plus, those external battery packs, when large enough to provide anything beyond a brief emergency reprieve on battery drainage are as large as the phone itself, volumetrically. Or, I have to have a cable and a charger (the very specific QuickCharge2.0 charger, if I want it to be anything less than sluggish taking its juice) and orbit wall sockets all day, also raising the wireful factor of this wireless phone, and increasing the bumps in my pockets to boot.\nI know that to some, carrying extra batteries is the same as carrying a battery pack, but a PAIR of fully charged batteries isn't even the size of one of those external packs.

I was a big LG fan. The G3 was perfect. Never had an issue. As soon as the G4 launched I upgraded 3 of my lines to them. When the G4's arrived, I took my case off my G3, and noticed I had some light bleed on the left side,almost as if the screen was beginning to lift off. I keep my devices in mint condition, glass screen protectors and a rugged case on day 1. Anyway, 5 months in on the G4, my wife's G4 randomly began bootlooping. She doesn't root or mod anything. Thankfully, it was still under warranty, and AT&T sent a \"new\" one. 2 months later same thing happened to my daughters G4. Meanwhile, mine was still fine. On the 8th month, it was my turn. Luckily, I was still under 1 year warranty, and sent a new one out. However, I began researching the issue and it turned out and motherboards that started with SN 505xxxxx were bound to have this issue due to poor quality control and a solder point becomes loose in time from the heat of the device. So it just became a matter of time for each device. All my replacement phones began with a different SN. But at this point, I couldn't face losing data again. Yes, I was backed up, but not within the last month. \nNeedless to say, LG had now left a bad taste in my mouth... When i saw the G5 had changed so many things, plus removed all the buttons on the back, just wasnt crazy about the build. So when the s7 edge launched, I went with that. Never had a Samsung phone before. Great phone, buying a screen protector for it with a case is a nightmare though. I hope with the G6 or V11, it gets better. I hope all you people that bought the G5 still feel the same about it by the time the G6 rolls out, then maybe I will rethink buying an LG product. Especially at launch.

It's still early in the running but from everything we've seen it's really nice. Gold unit from AT&T store had excellent fit and finish, no noticeable screen issues. \nScreen is super sharp and color accurate. It's one of the best LCD's I've seen on a phone. LCD vs OLED.. everyone has their opinion and there are trade offs for either. \nThis processor combo is excellent. Opens everything quickly and moves from task to task seamlessly. Haven't seen a lag or stutter yet.\nThe two camera addition is a great one and is actually making us think of upgrading the G4 in the family as well though I don't want to lose the curved leather back since it feels so good in the hands. \nThe G5 feels nice in it's own right, solid without being weighty, and the inclusion of a sharper edge is a nice touch as it adds a little grip to an otherwise fairly slick phone. The little curve at the top of the screen makes me want to pull down the notifications/settings screen over and over like a little worry stone. (Though it does make glass screen protectors an issue). \nI had no idea that I actually wanted a fingerprint scanner on a phone till I tried this one. Once I figured out to show it more of my finger during the setup it opens the phone very quickly and makes my G4 a little jealous.\nNot a fan of moving the volume rocker back to the sides of the phone. I accidentally press it from time to time.\nBattery life is fine and seems to be in close range of other phones sporting the 820. With quick charge and a user replaceable battery it's surpassed any phone I've used to date in this regard so I'm not sure why folks have issues with power maintenance. One thing I haven't thoroughly tested but did notice is that using an Aukey quick charger seems to power up the phone much more quickly than the one that came in the box.\nAnother thing that I don't see mentioned much is the speaker... it's LOUD. You don't need an additional speaker to hear it over the shower quite clearly. Now, it's certainly lacking in bass but it's a definite improvement over the G3 and G4.\nI don't know if this is a G5 thing or a Marshmallow thing that isn't activated on my G4 build but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that always on listening for \"OK Google\" is an option! I thought you had to go Motorola for this feature. Makes this phone quite useful in the kitchen with messy hands. Perhaps this has something to do with the always on display which is also a nice touch and a useful upgrade in my opinion. No more opening the phone for notifications that aren't terribly important, the application that's asking for your attention is clearly displayed at a glance.\nDear AT&T,\nENOUGH WITH THE BLOATWARE ALREADY! It's bad enough that you pre-install it, it's worse that we can't remove it!\nReally didn't play with the UX very much as we're Action 3 or Nova users so no good comparisons there.\nWe went into the store primarily to get our hands on both the G5 and the S7E before we made the decision and I've got to say they're both very appealing in their own ways. In the end it was the removable battery system, two camera setup, no hardwired capacitive and home buttons, and the placement of the fingerprint scanner that made the decision for us.

Snapdragon 800, 5.2\" 1080p display, 3000mah battery, and I don't know what else were too much to not give it try. Once I got it, saw how fast it was(back then), realized the battery lasted for a while, and that it had no buttons on the front... making it look like it was just a pure screen... I was hooked!!! \nEvery flagship release since then, I've gotten excited and tried. G3/G4.. My wife loves Samsung... so I got try all those too and nothing could keep up. Maybe they were sliiiightly faster, but battery was always dead... and I didn't care enough about QHD to deal with it. \nWhen G5 came out at MWC, I was worried because of the smaller 2800 mah battery, but figured worst case I'd be able to get a spare and still make it through the day. \nBut when Samsung came out with the s7 edge and it's larger battery 3600mah...

As of now 12 hours 41 minutes on battery and at 40% with 3 hrs 50 min OST. Speaker is plenty loud and sounds as good as any bottom firing speaker I've heard. \nCameras are excellent and the wide angle camera was so nice to have last night at an awards dinner at my daughters school. We ended up on the second row from the stage and as groups of students stood side by side to get their awards I easily snapped excellent quality pictures of 20 students standing shoulder to shoulder. My family members all using \nIPhone 6's were amazed with my wide angle shots, regular shots and the zoomed shots. The G5 pictures truly killed the IPhones and it was so cool to be able to use and enjoy what I thought would be more of a gimmick with the wide angle lens. \nDownsides: Not as easy to grip as G4 with leather back and 5X, but much better than 6P and N6. The fingerprint scanner does not seem to be as accurate as the 5X. I can place my finger(s) at any angle on the 5X scanner and get an instant read 99% of the time whereas the G5 is probably 70%. If I place my finger flat every time it actually seems a little quicker than the 5X, but its hard to do that every time. Am I nit picking?

When you look up product reviews, hotel reviews, or theme park attraction reviews, sure, you get a lot of good reviews or feedback; but there are still those forum sites or Facebook pages where you see a ton of negativity, and I think that that can very often colour one's perception of the product, place, or thing in question.\nWhen the G5 first came out, I was skeptical, to be honest. I looked at photos and looked at MWC postings and yes, I wasn't too keen on it; but now I am warming up to it. I think the G5 is arguably the most interesting phone of 2016 (I saw an article on Google that coined it as such, and I agree with that statement): it's even \"infamous\" in some forums or conversation circles, I am sure. But it isn't fair that when someone is trying to do real, investigative research on a phone, they are suddenly hit with a ton of negative reviews (or, at least, it seems that way). Of course, opinions and perceptions are subjective; so when you're trying to sit down and see if the phone you're researching checks off the numbered items on your list (which can arguably be objective or subjective, depending on what's on your list), it may be really difficult to iron out what is \"reality\" (i.e., display: is it as good as that person says, and what does LG say about it? And how do you, yourself experience the display when you test it out in the store?) vs what is something that may be coloured by a negative perception/bias. There's bias in everything...\nSorry, I think I went off on too much of a rant; but I totally agree with you: when you look at the G5 forum page here, for example, you see a lot of people saying they don't like it/returned theirs (and hey, I was in the \"I don't like it\" camp for a while, so I'm not saying there's anything wrong with people merely stating their opinions! )/don't like it for X reasons; and it may make things difficult for people who are considering the purchase of the device.

I liked it significantly better than my Note 4 before it. \nGot the G5 on release day and my first few weeks with my original unit were great. The phone is fast and fluid, Nova Launcher works incredibly well with it, Bluetooth pairing is very fast (a problem I've seen with other phones in my car) and the audio over BT is amazing. I've also noticed that this phone stays decent in a few weak cellular zones in the area. Enough so that audio quality doesn't drop when streaming from Google Play Music.\nBattery life I'd give a 'fair', i live off my phone. 1/2 the day on conference calls, I travel almost daily for work and it's my mobile compute, I tether almost daily, etc. I usually have to put it on the charger just after lunch, but with the quick charge 3.0 it's back up near full very quickly. OR, I can throw in the battery (Which is why I am loving LG right now).\nThe bad...my first phone died after 3 weeks. It started crashing 4 to 5 times a day and then it would get stuck in a reboot loop. LG Screen, T-Mo screen, reboot. I'd pull the battery, bring it back up and it'd start working again. On the third day of this behavior it went into a reboot look, the T-Mobile screen came up garbled and then the phone went dead and never powered back up. Even when thrown on a diagnostics machine @ the store, nada. They replaced it and within 24 hours (Thankfully I have a LG Leon as a backup) I was in a new unit. Why they can't exchange a dead unit at the store after 14 days is beyond me. \nNow the new phone I'm having wifi problems with. It keeps dropping from the wifi network and will get in a situation where it will be connected to wifi but no data will come down. I shut off the wifi and *boom* blazing fast data. I've noticed the phone is also getting really hot when I am on wifi as well. So I'm starting to think I have another bad phone. \nI love the phone, but have never seen issues like this before and am considering trying a S7E just for giggles. I have Jump On-Demand and have only done 1 jump since getting it...so why not.

But first let me give you a little bit of my smartphone background.<br />\n<br />\nFor the past 2 years, I have not kept a single phone for more than a month. The phone that I kept one month was the Galaxy S7 which was as recent as 3 weeks ago. Before that it was the HTC One M8 that I kept for 3 weeks. I constantly chang smartphones and I definitely have a condition . Im stating that because I have tried every phone you can possibly think of that came out from early 2014 till now. Prior to 2014 I wasnt going as crazy as I did the last couple of years. I'm slowing down now so that's good lol. <br />\n<br />\nJust to name a few, I had the S7, Note 5, 6P, V10, G4, S6, S6 edge, S6 edge plus, Moto X, Xperias, Iphone 6s and 6s plus...not going to name them all but you get the point. So I'm very familiar with smartphones and I got a pretty damn good idea how they rank imo and in some areas objectively. The LG G5 is top 5 phones I have ever used EASILY. Is it the very best? No. I'll personally give that to the S7 (exynos variant) but it's right up there. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI got my G5 a few days ago and I'm already in love with it. It's not perfect by any means, but its a damn good phone and when I like or love something I feel the need to speak on behalf of it or defend it....whatever you wanna call it. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe phone has been out for over a month now so I got lucky and I didn't get any build quality issues. My module at the bottom Is perfectly lined up, no warping on the back of the phone, I don't notice any light bleed....my unit is as perfect as can be. <br />\n<br />\nThis phone has a fantastic display. I can see it very clearly in sunlight. No it's not as bright as the S7 but it's perfectly fine for me and it is super duper sharp. The wide angle camera is probably the best feature this phone has, it's too dope. I wonder why OEMs didn't think of doing that before, it's really really straight \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. <br />\n<br />\nThe performance is OUTSTANDING!!!!! This phone absolutely flies without slowing down ever. No lag, no stutter, it just slices through everything. Battery life is good. Not great, not bad, but it's good. I'd say it's slightly above average. I have only had my phone for 3 days but I get 4 1/2 of screen on time every day. In fact I'm on pace to reach over 5 hours of sot today. Plus I have the extra battery and cradle so I just swap batteries. I have yet to charge my phone, So convenient. Also, this is the thing that inspired me to start this post the most, it's the standby time of this phone. I have never ever ever ever seen anything like this before. Whether in wifi or mobile network data, whether the phone is laying down or is in your pocket, if you don't use the phone it does not drop one percent for HOURS. Im so impressed by that because coming from a Samsung phone, Samsung devices have atrocious standby time. But this is even better than an iPhone. It's absolutely insane.<br />\n<br />\nWhich leads me to say this. People bash LG for the G5 design, it's ugly, it feels cheap blah blah blah.....I understand all that. But there's another way to look at it. This is the only flagship to offer a removable battery. Whether you care for that or not you still gotta respect it. And the way it's done is pretty stylish to me, I have fun Everytime I switch the battery. Also they are pretty much the only OEM to still offer the IR blaster. Again, even if you don't use it it's there and it's the fact that LG gives us that option that is cool. Same thing with the coating on the back of the phone that ppl say feels plasticky, but it was done to hide the antenna bands. It seems to me that LG did what they did, having the best interest of the consumers in mind. Of course they wanna make money and all that but they could have easily ditched the removable battery, made a full metal unibody non removable battery device a la Samsung and call it a day. Instead they took the risk with the modularity. Today it's not respected but in the future when we look back at that, we will pay homage to LG for that. Great phone and I would recommend anyone to give it a try, it is totally worth it. I love the LG G5 and I'm very proud of it. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI still think the Exynos Galaxy S7 is overall the better phone, just because of the crazy battery life. In terms of performance they both cancel each other out. In day to day operation, fluidity and seem less operation I have to give it to the G5. In terms of loading apps, especially games and game play I have to give it to the S7. Both leads are minor but I do notice a difference. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe LG G5 is an incredible phone, I'm confident that if you take a 100 ppl on XDA who don't care for this device and let them test the phone for a few days, most of them will have a different opinion about it.

Typically this error happens when an App has been disabled that should not have been. It could also simply be an app you downloaded or updated that is causing this issue. So I realize you have photos you don't want to get rid of. If all else fails you could plug into a computer and grab your photos and then factory reset. But first. I would suggest trying to think about what apps you have disabled, downloaded or ones that have updated that you can recall and take your phone into safe mode.\nNow if you don't get the error in SafeMode. that means it's an app aka a software issue. If it DOES happen in SafeMode then it could be hardware, and I would try backing up your photos on a computer and then a factory reset and if that doesn't work it's hardware for sure.\nBut first safe mode. Here is how you access it on the LG G5, how to remove apps, and how to get out of safe mode,Enter Safe Mode\nFirst, power on your smartphone.\nThen, press and hold the Power button.\nFrom the menu options that will be displayed, choose Power Off.\nThe \u2018Restart in safe mode\u2019 message will be displayed on your LG G5.\nTap on OK in order to reboot into Android Safe Mode.\nWait while the reboot sequence is completed; in the end the Safe Mode icon will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.Uninstall apps from Safe Mode\nDrag down the notification area on your device.\nTap on the Settings icon.\nThen choose General and then select Apps.\nChoose the Downloaded tap by swiping right.\nSelect the apps that you want to uninstall.\nResume the uninstall process by following on screen prompts.Turn off Safe Mode\nWhile still running in Android Safe Mode, press and hold the Power button.\nThe menu options will be once more displayed.\nFrom there choose Power Off and Restart.\nYour LG G5 will be now rebooted into Android mode.\nBest bet is to start uninstalling apps one by one. Each time after uninstalling in safe mode going BACK to regular mode and seeing if the problem persisted.\nIF you did disable and app. And this started happening after you did that.

However, when that happens, if I unplug and then plug the cable in again (using either end of the cable), it will usually actually fast charge. \nI'm still trying to debug the issue, so about 5 minutes into my drive home, I open the battery graph to see if it's really fast charging. It hasn't happened the last couple of days, but I've been making sure to plug in the phone after the car has been turned on and the car charger is powered. I don't know if that was the problem, but if things continue to work for the next couple of charges, I'll go back to plugging in the phone before I turn on the car and see if it makes any difference.\nI may have had this issue with the LG supplied charger, but I haven't used that one much. Usually I plug in my phone on the commute home, even though it's still at 60% and I don't charge it again until I go to sleep, where I use a standard charger on my nightstand.\nAnyhow, when I was testing the fast charging with the LG charger a day or so after getting the phone, I ran the battery down, plugged it into the fast charger with the LG cable, and an hour later noticed that it hadn't charged any faster than my G3 would, even though it still claimed it was fast-charging. I swapped from the LG cable to a cable I got from Amazon and then it really did fast charge.

G5 Handsets by other carriers do not appear to be affected.\nPSA: I can confirm that there IS an issue with the LG G5's Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 compatibility with at least some \"certified\" 3rd party Quick Charge 3.0 chargers (i.e. it doesn't work)! Be aware that if you are connecting your G5 to a 3rd party Quick Charge 3.0 charger, you may not even be getting Quick Charge 2.0 - Just basic charging (see below).\nAn ANKER PowerPort 2 with Quick Charge 3.0 was used for this testing. Multiple G5's plugged into the 3.0 port, using an acceptable cord, would NOT sustain a Fast Charging connection. The G5's would report \"Fast Charging\" for 2-3 seconds before reverting to standard \"Charging\". Let me elaborate on that more. The ANKER charger is designed to detect a Quick Charge capability (2.0 or 3.0), and then deliver the appropriate load. An S6 was connected to the 3.0 port on the ANKER charger, and a Quick Charge 2.0 capability was detected resulting in the S6 Fast Charging. With the G5, this does not happen. The phone or charger reverts to basic charging due to charging feedback sent by the G5.\nAs I stated initially, this means that if you've sprung for a certified Quick Charge 3.0 charger, you will be worse off than if you simply use a 2.0 ONLY charger. Since this is a major issue, I suspect LG will rectify this in a system update. Hopefully, in the near future.\nI am interested in hearing from others who have purchased a Qualcomm certified Quick Charge 3.0 charger, and have observed it \"Fast Charging\" for the duration of the charge.

I just dumped my Note 7 and got the G5. I should add that I got the G5 solely because it was available. Now, I liked some of the features of the Note 7 but hated so many more. For starters, I hated the edge screen; absolutely hated. It being a business oriented device, the curved edges took up a lot of the screen viewable area and made the screen look smaller. Having the flat screen on the Note 5 was so much better. I genuinely wish I kept my Note 5 vs trading for the 7. The retinal unlock this was cool as well but mostly a novelty since it was very picky about position when trying to unlock using your eyes. The note 7 was also laggy and was actually slower in tasks than my note 5. The battery on the Note 5 lasted so much longer as well. All in all, I personally don't think the Note 7 is worth its $850 price tag. Plus, I was disappointed by it since it lost its businessie appeal. Another thing that I find undesirable is apparently the Note 7 doesn't support Bluetooth texting. You may ask what this is but in our cars that have Ford Sync with MyTouch, they use a features called Bluetooth texting which allows the cars radio to read off the text message via the car speakers and clear the new text notification. This feature worked on the Note 5 and previous galaxy phone; not on the note 7. Huge bummer.\nMy overall rating and view point of the Note 7 is that it is a great concept while being a lackluster execution. I do know for sure that if the edge screen becomes a standard feature on galaxy phones,,, I will never buy another.", "time": "09-18-2016 08:35 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "V10 or G5?", "thread": [{"postID": "post5469783", "text": "I got rid of my Note 3 earlier this year for the V10 and love it!

I purchased the Gold S7 as soon as it came out. My first unit, would drop calls randomly and the camera was horrible. \nThe second new replacement unit, the speaker had that crackling sound when you would play any music or youtube video. None of the \"fixes\" worked.\nThe third new replacement unit, brought it home and it seemed fine. I was ok with it. Then, I brought up a web browser and noticed a pencil eraser sized dark spot in the screen........ \nAfter having to go through store manager, district manager, regional manager at T-Mobile, I exchanged for a new LG G5.\nLOVE IT.\nFor one, it works, no defects. The screen has no spots in it. The camera is 10 times the camera of the S7, I don't care what anyone tells you. The previous Galaxy's had a great camera, the new 12mp STINKS...... You think that picture is good when you take it, except it will NOT focus on anything close up. Also, trying zooming in on the pic you take with the S7, it will pix-elate terribly because of the low MP. The reviews that say it is the best camera out, I have no idea what they are comparing it to. The S6 and Note 5 camera blows it out of the water.\nI constantly had people asking me to speak up, etc. on the S7. Not sure if it had something to do with the waterproofing or not, but it was very annoying. The S7 could be a fantastic phone, but in my opinion, it just has too many mechanical issues for me.\nNow, PHYSICALLY, the S7 is perfect. It is what ALL phones should be. The LG G5, I have read all the horror stories and seen the pics about the QC of these devices and I was scared. Mine, the gold model from T-Mobile, isn't bad.\nIt has a couple of places on it that I am not happy about, but they are minor. I know paint from previous automotive experience. This looks to me like they clamped the phone with something, sprayed it, let it dry, then took it off and it has those indentions in the paint and primer. Should they be there? Nope, but worse things could happen for sure.\nThere is a small gap on the battery tray on one end and flush on the other end, but it is very small and nothing major. I can live with it and you will never notice it with your case on. I am very OCD on phones and even without a case, it doesn't bother me.\nThe UI/UX is very good. The speed is top notch as well. I really like the phone and if I had to tell anyone to chose between these devices, I would be very comfortable telling you to go with the LG G5. It has THE BEST camera on the market right now.\nA couple of final notes. The battery on the G5 is very good. It is not quite as good as the s7, but you will have no trouble going all day on it with heavy usage. The S7, my first unit had mediocre battery life. The next two had superb battery life and is better than the LG. Forget about listening to music on the S7 as the speaker is atrocious. The G5 has a fantastic speaker that you could listen to all day if you want.\nIf you have any specific questions, please feel free to post and I will answer if I can.", "time": "04-20-2016 12:58 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5137046", "text": "Seemed like the first S7 you had was the best of the bunch.

Of course LG speaker is better. That's a fact. \nBut the third replacement sounds bad as well as the G5 you got with the built quality issues.

The G5 camera is MILES ahead.\nThe first S7 was horrible. I was on a few very important business calls and the phone dropped me twice. The client had to call back, I was not in a bad signal area either. \nThe second phone, no way I will keep a defective speaker phone just because it is a Samsung.\nThird, bad amoled screen on a brand new phone? No way, no how. So third time was the charm. \nI have been using this phone extensively to put it through its paces. I have found 0 issues outside if the very minor cosmetic issues and a weird auto dimming of the screen even when auto dimming is turned off. \nSoftware issues can be remedied.

This is the second LG G5 on which I've had this issue.

I've also used the new card in my old LG G3 and saved pictures without a problem. Photos saved to internal storage are unaffected. I've tried all the usual routes; chkdsk to ensure that the SD card is not corrupt, formatting the card, reseating the card, remounting the card and clearing the camera app data and cache etc. but to no avail. I'm assuming therefore that this is some sort of issue with the phone itself and that, perhaps, the vendor I purchased from has a faulty batch.

I was a die hard Nokia fan back in Nokia's glory days. So in the smartphone era I stuck with them even when they went to Windows Phone. I'm also big on having the best camera you can get on a phone. Nokia was no slouch in the camera department so I was happy. \nI had brief forays with other brands and ecosystems (iphone 4s, LG Nexus 5, Samsung galaxy Note 4)but got bored of them pretty quickly and ended up back on Windows Phone with the Lumia 950 and its Nokia camera DNA. \nBeing a cellphone geek I'm always watching reviews of phones, most of which I don't buy. But something about the LG G5 peaked my interest when it first came out. However a lot of the reviewers seemed disappointed with it, so that was a bummer. \nFast forward to about two weeks ago and Windows Phone lost two apps that are crucial to me. Myfitnesspal and Amazon. Myfitnesspal is especially important to me. Tired of making excuses for Windows Phone I finally decided it was time to switch platforms. I was considering the iphone, but that would be a step backwards with camera quality. The Note 7 really interested me at first, and I was seriously considering getting one, but for $1100 (in Canada) it seemed a bit much for an S7 edge with a stylus. Then I remembered the LG G5. Looked up the specs online again and was happy to see the same Snapdragon 820 and 4GB of ram as the Note 7! Even better was I got an unlocked dual-sim version for $540 CAD!! Half the price of the Note 7. \nI've only had it for a week, but I'm VERY happy with it. I don't understand why so many reviewers seemed disappointed with it. I think they get bamboozled by Samsung's admittedly gorgeous screens and fit and finish, that it skews their verdict. \nMy reasons for it being underrated:\n-The LG G5 is fast as hell. I haven't been able to make it hiccup once.\n-I LOVE that it has double tap to wake on the lockscreen. Any old Nokia fan will appreciate this. \n-The camera ROCKS. The wide angle camera is a game changer in my opinion. I've been having a blast with it. \n-I like LG's skin on Android. Seems less invasive than touchwiz and a little closer to stock Android. \n-In my experience at least, battery life is quite good. I work 11 hour shifts and when I get home from work I'm still at about 55%-60%\n-Removable battery and MicroSD card support. 'Nuff said. \n-The feel is nicer than online reviewers had me believing. It does not feel like plastic to me. \n-Value! Value! Value! Getting a phone with specs like Snapdragon 820, 4GB of ram, QHD display, dual camera arguably best on the market at the moment for $540 CAD unlocked is a bargain and it can't be beat.\nThere you have it. Long winded post I know. But I see a lot of people giving the G5 flak and I just don't see why.

My carrier stopped offering it. I had a few Fido dollars saved up and needed to use them. \nI just bought my grandson a Galaxy S6 a few months back. It looked very similar to his S3. I think Samsung makes great phones but I'm not a fan of TouchWiz but decided to get the S7. (my phone had to be better than his). It was out of stock. The sales person tried to sell me the G5 but it was out of stock as well. I knew nothing about it and wanted to do some research first. It all looks good so l call Fido to order the S7 from them but they had none either. Back to the G5. The sales person again tries to sell me the G5 and tells me it's $250 cheaper than the S7. Sold. Then comes back and tell me he made a mistake and it's only $150 cheaper. Not a deal breaker so I buy it. \nThe next day it gets delivered (Sunday). In the meantime I'm reading review after review and no one has anything good to say about this phone. \nNow, I'm bummed. I think I made a huge mistake. \nAnyway, I unbox the phone and start looking for these things that are supposed to be wrong with it and find nothing. As a matter of fact, I think it's the koolest looking phone ever. It's kind of manly looking. It's real solid and it's got a nice weight to it and it feels great to hold. I also heard somewhere that it was made from magnesium, not aluminum but I can't validate that. I just like it. \nSo far, so good. I'm happy! \nThen I started using it. Wow! What an amazing gadget. Super fast. The fingerprint scanner was tempermental when I first set it up. But now it is so fast and accurate. \nThe LG skin? Not a fan. A lot of people said there was no app drawer but I bought my phone in June so the option was there. I use Nova Launcher anyway. That issue solved. \nNow, for the real reason I bought the G5. I had the Nexus 4 and the camera was crap. Same with the iPhone 4. Same with the Nexus 7, the Nexus 9. I wanted a decent camera but boy did I get much more. The main camera is stunning! The second wide-angle lens is really fun and very good. It takes great videos and has a ton of features and extras. Too many to go thru here. Just know that all the flagship phones have great shooters. The G5 has an extra one. \nNow! I tried to use the phone out in the sun and was quite disappointed until I clicked the auto feature. The thing finally went bright enough that I can see it and actually use it. The first gadget ever that I could use in the bright sun. \nNow, on to the extras. I didn't buy this phone because it was modular. Good thing. I can't seem to find any in Canada anyways. I was happy I had the ability to swap the battery out though but never have yet. I don't see a need for that. The battery life is way better than what I am used to. SD card support is a real bonus.\nI've always wanted a gadget with an IR Blaster and didn't even know that the G5 had it. But what an awesome thing to discover. And it works really good. It takes the place of six separate ones. \nAnother added bonus is the FM radio which I haven't even used yet. \nThere you have it! I could go on and on about this really great phone but I will start to wind this down now. \nReally! What's there not to like? The small battery? I don't have battery issues. The gaps between the chin and the body? Not present. Some complain about the build quality. Mine looks great! Other's have mentioned the screen bleeding. I don't have that. I'm sure some must have it and that's awful. I love this screen. \nAll in all I'm really glad the sales person talked me into buying this phone.

For someone to say that the OP3 is flat out better is pretty bold. I'd like some proof. \nFor starters, the camera is NOT better. Just look at the aperture size. The G5 in my opinion takes the best photos of all the flagship phones but picture taking is really subjective. It also takes phenomenal low-light pics. The deal breaker for me is that second wide-angle shooter. It's so fun to use and you can use them together as well as separate. Pretty cool and a lot of fun. All the flagship phones take really good photos. \nThe specs of the two devices are identical except the two more gigs of ram in the OP3. \nThe screen in the OP3 is amoled sure but lacking in pixel density. But I don't think your eyes can even tell the difference. The amoled screens are usually over saturated. \nThe battery is only 2800mah but it lasts all day for me. Besides, you can swap it out if need be. But, trust me. You won't need to. The G5 has the quick-charge 3.0 but I'm sure the OP3 has it also. Screaming fast charging. So the battery is not an issue. \nThe G5 has SD card support up to 2tb. They only make cards up to 200gb anyway. But the OP3 does not have this. With the G5 you can either put in an SD card or use the slot for a second Sim. \nAll the snapdragon 820's have FM radio capabilities but most don't activate it. The G5 has it activated but not in all devices. I think the carriers disable it in some... Like mine. Wah...! \nOne of my favorite features of the G5 is the IR Blaster. Really useful. I'm not sure if the op3 has it or not. I'm guessing not. \nSo... \nTwo gigs of ram make it better? I don't think so. \nGood luck choosing.

Since battery seems important to you, that's one area where the G5 has the advantage, since you can swap batteries easily. The 6P has a pretty big battery, but its battery life still isn't phenomenal--with relatively light-moderate use, I generally get around 3-4 hours of screen-on time per 100% charge on my 6P (which is extrapolated--I never use it down to 0% battery).

Android N is already out for 6P owners\nThere is NO sdcard, so if you like alot of photos or videos or music on your device... get the 64 or even the 128GB version.. It is a great phone, but personnaly for me, it was a bit on the big side and I found pure google abit too plain.... the 6P is great for 3rd party roms and tinkerring..\nNow the G5 is different in every way.... it has a dual camera setup, an SDCard slot and tbe single 2amp speaker is very loud and surprisingly good... its also 24bit, so you can use it in your media centre to play hi-res music..\nThe G5 is much smaller than the 6p and easily managable, it also uses LGs UX5 skin, which is quite nice.\nNow or some of the reviews online... the G5 is not hideous or ugly as the Samsung kids keep saying it is.., it has 2 camera eyes on the back which can give the G5 a robot look, and as everyone and their dog has an iPhone or a Samsung, the G5 looks unique and actually quite cool... Ive personally never had any issues with the anodised back cover looking like plastic, there are alot of complaints about this... I like it. \nHowever, one thing I will say is If you do go for a G5... before you buy check that the battery base where the module meets the body of the phone, there are no big gaps. but apart from that... Its a stunning phone...\nBoth phones are awesome in their own way and very fast and smooth .. the 6p is Big, Its Loud .. but its pure Android with no frills or Skins, it has no SDcard and youll probable have to download most apps to the 6P\nThe G5 is smaller, but looks very cool.. has 2 amazing cameras and has Hi-Res audio...\nHope that helps", "time": "08-31-2016 07:36 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5429611", "text": "Excellent and very fair comparison, Fully agree with your review.

Granted this phone does have two mics, would holding the other mic down help reduce the noise? Is there an app that records sound from both mics (in stereo)? Because when I record video, the movies are in stereo format.\nThe good thing about my previous phone (Alcatel Idol 3 5.5\") is it had two mics, which could record in stereo, so if I held my phone to the speaker of the ride, only that side would play the music.\nIf anyone has recorded memos from their phone, let me know of a good app or a good way to record. \n- Paul / Conversus Vans\n.", "time": "08-25-2016 06:00 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5418562", "text": "You might find in SnipBack a good solution:\nthey invented a crazy innovative way to record voice, and they have built in noise reduction.

Not MMS, just regular messages. It CAN still receive them, but they're delayed an hour or more. When I attempt to send a message, it stays on \"Sending\" with the spinning circle forever, and I never get the exclamation point that says \"message failed to send\" or anything. I've tried sending to people on multiple carriers. The only message I've been able to send is 1 to the number the T-Mobile support man gave me (on my first attempt. The second message to him just kept 'sending'). I have full bars/service, there are no outages in the area, and my WiFi and 4G LTE are working. I can open up apps and Chrome fine.\nAdditionally, most of my widgets are no longer working after I restarted the phone to try to fix the texting issue. The Clock/Weather/Alarm app is still \"waiting for location\" after 2 hours and displays no information. A separate weather widget is also waiting for location and displays all \"N/A\"s for the weather. My International Space Station tracking widget is entirely blank. Deleting the widgets from my home screens and putting them on again does not work.\nAlso, several apps are displaying outdated notification counts on their icons. The Facebook app, for example, tells me I have 3 notifications. I can click on the app and Facebook opens up fine, but within the app, I have 0 notifications. When I exit the app and return to the home screen, it still has a \"3\" in the red circle on the app icon. The same is true with Snapchat. Says I have notifications, but I've already looked at them in the app; it doesn't clear from the icon. \nSpent an hour with T-Mobile troubleshooting with no luck. LG support told me to turn off my phone for 30 minutes (did nothing). LG then told me to boot in Safe Mode. In Safe Mode, I was able to send the texts that were already pending/sending, but I was not able to send new texts. When I booted in Safe Mode, I also got a string of texts I assume had been backed up. When replying to these texts didn't work in Safe Mode, I went back to regular mode and tried to send them. That didn't work, so I assumed they'd send when I switched to Safe Mode like last time, but they did not send, and instead, the Messaging app failed to open. \"Messaging is not responding\" with the option to wait or close the app. Waiting never worked, and I never got it to open after closing the app. Spent an hour in Safe Mode as LG recommended, but still nothing is fixed.\nCalled LG back and naturally their only solution is a factory reset, which I'd really love to avoid because it's such a hassle.\nOther things I've tried\n-Powering off with battery removed, SD removed\n-Switching between different network modes\n-Clearing all messaging data\n-Clearing all cached data\nI've got 10 GB free on internal storage and 36 GB free on my SD card.

Also, it was 4 am towards the end of my test last night... so for sure auto brightness was low(it always changes.. so didn't keep track). If I had to give you an average of the brightness level throughout the drain... I'd say it was probably around 30-40% brightness.

I went with the G5 since I've always had LG phones. I got it home started downloading my apps and using the camera. I noticed the camera is very laggy, it takes a few seconds for the camera to focus on what I am trying to take a picture of. By the time it's focused in, what I am trying to take a picture of has moved (mostly the kids or dogs). I also tried taking a picture with snapchat (on both the front camera & back camera) & there is a blue vertical line that is throughout the screen when taking the pictures. It's mostly on the right side of the screen but will move and jump around to the middle of the screen and back to the right again.

Is this normal for the camera? Should I take it back tomorrow and get the S7 Edge or a replacement G5? Thanks for reading this and helping me out.

SD card support was broken in Lollipop and they hadn't solved fixing it yet 2. They didn't have the time/money to figure out how to do better design, waterproofing and the SD card slot, so for 2015 they chose fixing the design and in 2016 they reintroduced the other two. \nAs for your \"can't\" release phones with removable battery comments, you started out correct and then went somewhere else. The removable battery is 100% a cost/benefits issue - and the costs far outweigh the benefits according to Samsung's data of how people use phones. The built in obsolescence comments are just false. No OEM is designing a phone that will predictably die soon so that you have to buy another. Anyone found doing that would be instantly out of business and customers would go buy the phones that they feel are well built and will last. If you want your Note 4 or Note 5 or Note 7 to last for 2-3 years - and you take care of it - it will. If you want to replace it after 6-9 months, you can. That part is always up to the consumer. The most likely thing that will go wrong with devices, unless they are dropped and physically broken, is that 2-3 years after release they'll be so far behind on software that they just start getting buggy. That's what is happening with the Note 4 right now. The hardware is still fine, but the software becoming outdated and apps are breaking and it's exposed to more and more security vulnerabilities. \nAnd having a larger battery in a device with better battery life can hardly be called \"sacrificing battery\".

These decisions about what to put into devices are data driven and as the largest OEM, they have the most data about how people use devices. The S6 and Note 5 lost SD cards for two reasons. 1. SD card support was broken in Lollipop and they hadn't solved fixing it yet 2. They didn't have the time/money to figure out how to do better design, waterproofing and the SD card slot, so for 2015 they chose fixing the design and in 2016 they reintroduced the other two. \nAs for your \"can't\" release phones with removable battery comments, you started out correct and then went somewhere else. The removable battery is 100% a cost/benefits issue - and the costs far outweigh the benefits according to Samsung's data of how people use phones. The built in obsolescence comments are just false. No OEM is designing a phone that will predictably die soon so that you have to buy another. Anyone found doing that would be instantly out of business and customers would go buy the phones that they feel are well built and will last. If you want your Note 4 or Note 5 or Note 7 to last for 2-3 years - and you take care of it - it will. If you want to replace it after 6-9 months, you can. That part is always up to the consumer. The most likely thing that will go wrong with devices, unless they are dropped and physically broken, is that 2-3 years after release they'll be so far behind on software that they just start getting buggy. That's what is happening with the Note 4 right now. The hardware is still fine, but the software becoming outdated and apps are breaking and it's exposed to more and more security vulnerabilities. \nAnd having a larger battery in a device with better battery life can hardly be called \"sacrificing battery\". I'd much rather have a phone with a larger battery, more efficient SoC and display that sips power and lasts at least a full day, if not a day and a half or two days than have one that needs to be charged or swapped daily. \nPeople forget the Note 4 had a removable battery that was larger than the Note 5 and yet the Note 5 had better battery life.

However when I try to open it, 'Unfortunately Facebook has stopped'.\nWhen I then go to try and uninstall, I can only uninstall updates or disable - the phone has decided the app is now a system app. When I try doing that, the icon then remains on the phone but is not actionable, says the app doesn't exist on the phone.

I don't want it to feel anything \"More like metal\". As i've said before, there is a reason phone cases aren't made of bare cold metal. Its not nice to hold.\nThe build quality of the phones the majority have ended up with is perfectly fine. The thing that started this is some reviewers got very dodgy ones, which frankly LG should have caught before they left the factory. I imagine they were under pressure to get it shipping given the G7 was out, and that is regrettable. Almost everyone that swapped a unit got one that was fine second time round from what I've read. Most of the noise on build quality and 'metal' is from non-owners.\nFor the G6, Lg have a bit of a conundrum. Do they risk a backlash if they fail to maintain compatibility with modules (albeit that there are only two), or maybe they could get away with some kind of trade in service for old modules. Increasing the battery size could still maintain compatibility with the same form factor and modules, as long as they can make the battery denser. I imagine they could make it slightly wider or longer as long as the lugs were compatible, but the thickness is basically fixed. Or, if they sense that the modules are a dud (but the removeable battery people liked), they could just decide to change the form factor anyway.\nOther than that, I agree with bigger battery, and smaller bezels, and the camera would be useful with a quick manual exposure change. At the moment you have to drop into full manual to do that, I liked that on the Nexus 5 you could do a +1 or -1 if the auto got it wrong, and I do miss that. Plus, add manual mode to video. UI's can always be refined, and hopefully they will, but LG's is really pretty good. Don't agree with the display not being bright or washed out, its a fantastic display.\nI was a bit confused how point 1. can say keep the modules, then point 2, says get rid of the modules. Huh? I think having modules that work via bluetooth is a good idea. You don't have to use them if you don't want to, and they can retain compatibility with form factor changes.

Or is the clock always immediately correct when the phone has booted up?\nAnd secondly, can anyone make sense of this behaviour, and should I avoid using this battery?\nBy the way, I took the opportunity to look at the HTC 10, and the Samsung S7 since I had a second chance and getting a phone. They are both great phones, and the 10 does feel very nice - cant believe how light it feels. Waterproof S7 would be great after the last mishap.

Swapping out batteries is a breeze and gives me much longer battery life than the competition. Otherwise it is a legitimate drawback.\nOther complaints are about the paint and feeling cheap, but nearly everybody puts a case on the phone so that's mute, and some build quality issues which pop up in some reviews but not others.

I was on holiday, so didnt have screwdrivers etc. with me to open up until I got home, and when I did I think I can already see what looked like corrosion starting to happen inside the phone after just a few days. Cleaned it all out with alcohol, and it did boot up after several tries. The first few times it kept going to a firmware update screen (I think this was because the volume up button was permanently activating, and that seems to boot into that screen), and when I got it to boot it wouldn't recognise the SIM, but did connect to wifi and the screen all seemed to work, so I was hopeful. Left it charging, which appeared to work, but went back to it 2 hours later and it wont even switch on. Plugging it in shows a red battery with 0% next to it, and it doesn't charge. Not sure if that's the chin at fault, or the quick charge chip has now blown?\nI have to say though, having opened it up, its a work of art inside. Amazing design. There are no ribbon cables between the two halves of the phones, and only 2 standard phillips screws to get in. Everything between the two halves is managed via lots of tiny spring contacts which press on various metal plates on the other half. All of the components are a doddle to remove and replace individually.\nSo, any advice on what to do here?

I think it will just cause something to break (feels like I'm tearing it apart). I wouldn't be surprise if someday LG starts advising against regular battery swapping, despite their current marketing. \nI'm normally a big fan of extended batteries, but I don't think the G5 will be an easy candidate for one, with this particular modular design, unless someone comes up with a clever chin / case combination. And a battery case that plugs into the existing USB-C will make a tall phone even taller. \nBut here is why the battery on the G5 doesn't bother me at all. And in fact I like not carrying a boat anchor (extended battery) for the first time in a long time. Since it charges very fast, I won't hesitate to throw it on a charger for 20 minutes here and there if needed, whenever it is convenient as opposed to worrying about caring for the battery or the connector. I say misuse the heck out of it, and replace it in a year if needed. And the USB-C connector should be a lot more robust than the micro-USB.

LG's OIS for video is pretty amazing when you're trying to be very still, but any movement at all such as slight panning etc and you get the distortions and it's not smooth at all. And using STEADY isn't nearly as good / natural looking as the digital video stabilization on my old Note 3. For me I'll probably leave the G5 on OIS all the time and just live with the warping effect. \nNext serious issue for me is the audio recording quality when capturing video. The mic is WAY less sensitive than my Note 3, and it sounds very tinny. Sounds really bad in my opinion. Am I the only one?\nSo overall I'm really bummed by these things. I really wanted to like this phone more than I do. Tomorrow is my last day to return. I wish I would have experimented much sooner (didn't even take it out of the box for a week, what a dummy). \nBack to OIS vs STEADY, if STEADY really does turn off OIS (which I think is true) then for taking stills it's best to leave the camera in OIS all the time. For those that want OIS for stills and Steady for video, the G5 should provide an optional setting that automatically switches to Steady for recording video (even if it adds a tiny delay). No time to mess with settings like that each time you open the app.", "time": "06-10-2016 10:58 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "So I picked up a G5", "thread": [{"postID": "post5208304", "text": "I admit, I was one of those who was overly critical of the G5 when it was first announced and when the reviews started coming in. I was worried about the build quality and the light bleed issues. With that being said, my sister purchased an LG G5 and I played around with it for a little bit and I decided I wanted to get one. I went and purchased one the other day and I actually love it, despite how reviewers feel about it. \nThe wide angle camera is reason alone to get the phone because I love taking pictures of all the various landscapes. I work outside all over the country and that's reason alone to keep the phone. I also love how fast the G5 charges and that I can make the phone waterproof with a LifeProof case. I love the size of the phone. It's not too big and it's not too small. The screen is okay. I'm not a huge fan of IPS LCD displays, but I can definitely live with them. The modules are a non-issue for me. I didn't purchase this phone to use those (and by \"those\" I mean just the CAM+ module, since that's the only one available). The cameras are almost just as good as the cameras on the S7 edge. The colors seem more natural, but tend to be a little cool. The colors on the S7 edge are more vibrant. I'm happy with the cameras on both devices.\nThe only con of the G5 is the battery life. I've been getting about 3 hours SOT in the last two days. My S7 edge beat the G5 by giving me 5-5.5 hours SOT each day. I don't have an extra battery so I need to tether myself to a charger. Taking out the battery and replacing it with a full one is kind of an issue because my G5 has a LifeProof case on it. LifeProof cases aren't exactly easy to remove or to put back on.\nI'm trying to decide which phone to keep and which phone to sell/return. The things I love about the S7 edge is the beautiful AMOLED display, the huge battery, the IP86 rating (which doesn't really matter since my G5 has a LifeProof case on it), the ultra fast focus on the camera, the emojis are better, and the wireless charging. I may be able to overlook all of those positives in order to keep the G5. I really don't like the size of the S7 edge. I'm small and the phone is huge in my hands and in my pocket.

They can be physical, design, software, etc. related. \nFor reference, I've had the phone less than a month and previously had a Galaxy S5. Top 5 Favorite (in no particular order)\n1. Removable battery \n2. Wide angle lens\n3. IR blaster - I love being able to lay in bed and control my bluetooth sound system without having to look for the remote. \n4. Type C connector - Although it seems like a minor detail, it's SO much nicer to have a reversible cord to plug into the phone.\n5. Button placement - I was worried about being able to adjust to the power button on the rear of the phone and was thrilled to see that they were moving the volume buttons to the side. For me, this is the perfect combo. The power button is the perfect placement for fingerprint access (as opposed to Samsung's setup which was worthless to me). Having to work the volume buttons on the back, however, would have been a pain. Top 5 Worst\n1. No adoptable storage - By FAR, this is my top choice. If you're not going to allow me to put some apps on my SD card, then you need to have at least 64gb internal storage. \n2. Screen brightness - It's just doesn't compare to my old Galaxy.\n3. The launcher - This is my first LG phone. The launcher was garbage. No app drawer? Seriously?\n4. Battery and SD card replacement process - Changing out the battery isn't the greatest. After more than a year of swapping out batteries, I hope the phone holds up. Also, putting the SD card in was a pain in the butt. Thankfully, that's just a 1 time thing. \n5. Other miscellaneous software issues/choices - The bluetooth is buggy in my car, the fingerprint sensor is nice (but buggy), the lack of some features like multi-window or an option to put the flashlight button on my home screen, etc. It just doesn't seem as user-friendly as Samsung's setup.", "time": "06-06-2016 09:08 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5211889", "text": "Top 5 Best\n1.

Removable battery, micro SD card, SD card implementation breaks Marshmallow security features\n3. USB C would have been good - but they screwed it up and made it dangerous in the same way HTC did \n4. Audio and Camera - using modules to enhance functionality that should have been awesome from the start is weak and it really sucks. Please don't do that. \n5. Power button = FPS. I love the rear FPS and I don't mind a power button doubling as a FPS - but that can only happen if both are on the right side of the phone next to the volume keys. I really don't like the power button being on the back of the phone, so if the FPS is going to be there, let's use two separate buttons.", "time": "06-06-2016 09:15 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5211893", "text": "For me: \n5 favorite features: \n1) Wide angel camera - It's such a brilliant feature to have, my next phone needs to have it. \n2) Overall size.

I was spoiled with my S7e tho. \n4) No wireless charging. I invested a fair bit of cash on wireless chargers over the years\n5) Random lock screen issues. I don't lock my phone with my fingerprint, I just have the swipe to unlock feature enabled, but recently when I double tap the screen or press the power button it automatically by-passes the lock screen and unlocks my phone.", "time": "06-06-2016 09:16 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5211912", "text": "This is a cool thread, it's so much fun to see how much some features that people love are things that others don't want and the reverse.", "time": "06-06-2016 09:30 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5211924", "text": "Best\n1.

I have the G5 over 50% outdoors and it's still not enough. Indoors it's fine.\n2. No app drawer by default. Thankfully that was an easy fix.\n3. SD access. It's a pain to get to and now I have a special tool I need to keep track of just in case I decide to change it. Thankfully that won't happen very often.\n4. Bloat. Phones always have it but most of the time it's at least related to your coverage or you got some special access/features. Not here.

It's nice being able to swap batteries out quickly and have a full charge right away.\nAuto brightness is the best I've used on a phone. It's the first time I've used it and not reverted to manually adjusting brightness. As to the speed I haven't noticed the issues you talk about.\nNot sure what a wiggle back button is but if you mean the power button on the back I like it, liked it when I had a G2 and missed it on my Nexus 6.\nSide note, it has an always screen on function I wasn't sure I'd like but decided to give it a go.

Hardly drains at all. Thing like web browsing, facebook etc. and other 'light' apps is very good. When using games that really tax the graphics and power of that SD820, it's a bit thirsty. Games are so fluid though, never get any lag or stutter, but I guess that comes at a cost. So depending on what you are going to do on it, your mileage may vary. The absolute worst case seems to be 2.5-3 hours of SoT if you are the 'gamer' end, and quite a bit more if you arent. This phone charges seriously quickly though, so I haven't found it an issue, plus you can swap in a spare obviously.\nWiggle back button - I imagine you are referring to a couple of reviews saying the back button doesn't feel solid, and wiggles a bit. I haven't noticed any issues with mine. Was a little bit sceptical about the placement on the back, but now i'm used to it, it feels like exactly the right place, and i'm not sure i'd want a fingerprint sensor on the front in future. It means you can unlock one handed almost without thinking, the button just falls under your finger. On the front, I imagine you have to shuffle the phone around in your hand, or use the thumb on your other hand. It unlocks instantly as well.\nBuild quality - Cant dispute that some people have got duds, but mine feels solidly built, and I think it feels great in the hand. If I was OCD, I would be able to comment that the chin doesn't fit 100%, but it a good 99.9%. I think its within the tolerances you should expect given the removable design, but one side there is a fraction of a millimetre gap, which doesn't bother me. I know I wouldn't have even noticed it had there not been so much talk in reviews to make me go looking for it. This talk seems to have died down now, so I wonder if LG refined things in the factory to make them more consistent.\nAuto brightness - It does seem pretty good, using the full 0%-100% depending on lighting, but I think it could be better. My main comment is that it often cranks to full brightness in sunlight, when I would rather it was just 75-80% to conserve battery. If you turn the slider down, it will just slowly override you again as the light changes. Something which used the slider to calibrate how bright you want auto, would be a good addition I think. I'm sure that is how my Nexus 5 used to work, but could be wrong. Obviously I'd rather it was sometimes too bright, than too dim (Haven't had that issue).

Benson assumes that VESA DisplayPort is supported as well, and charging hubs that charge the phone while leaving a Type-A dongle to connect other things to may work with the G5 too (although these are assumptions, especially since the Nexus 5X and 6P didn't work with the latter). However, according to Benson's reply to LG's Ken Hong, while the G5 isn't completely violating Type-C specs, if Quick Charge 3.0 is used to modify the voltage past 5 volts, it violates Section 4.8.2 of the Type-C certification. So while it isn't completely violating Type-C specifications, the presence of QC 3.0 could mean that it's still not compliant. \nThis is a bit of a revelation and is probably one of the few positive G5 threads in the G5 subthread.

The Galaxy S5 was my first \"smart phone\" two years ago. Since then, I'd been through three of them because of people telling me, in phone calls that they couldn't hear me, I sounded far away, or I sounded like I was in a tunnel. But testing eventually revealed that this was an outgoing audio problem, apparently with the model, and that using the voice recorder app produced clear and crisp recordings. So about 2 weeks ago, Verizon facilitated replacing the blankety blank S5 ( I WILL NEVER OWN ANOTHER SAMSUNG PHONE! ) with the LG G5.\nSo far: \nPros:\n+ I'm happy with the outgoing audio quality on calls with my clients. None of the above complaints anymore!\n+ I'm happy with the new screen keyboard, in which the buttons are maybe 2.5 times the size of the little tiny ones on the S5< AND I no longer have to retype almost everything. Now, actually, I rarely have to retype anything.\nCons:\n- The automatic screen brightness setting is terribly dim in all lighting situations - so dim as to be unusable. I had to turn it off and set the phone to around 87%. Can this be fixed in software upgrades, by LG?\n- Touch tap sensitivity is sometimes ok, but other times very frustrating and I see no setting for increasing it. There have been times when we went to double tap the screen and had to keep tapping and tapping, while eventually slipping into foul language at the phone. Is this because of Denver's dry climate and dry fingers? Did I miss the setting somewhere?\n- I went to answer a phone call ( this happened twice this past week. ) and discovered that just tapping the circular answer button would not work ( lost a couple of calls ). Later discovered that I had to tap and drag, to answer calls, but the symbol had no arrows emanating from it, so who knew?\nThe phone also seems a little heavier, apparently because of a higher capacity battery? It lasts longer after taking it off the charger. And that brings up another con:\n- No wireless charging for this phone? As a former electronics R&D technician, I'm baffled by that. WHY? With the detachable bottom, I'd think it would be begging to be designed for a wireless charger. But to take a lesson from the S5, PUT A REGULATOR ON THE OUTPUT! I had a Qi wireless charger for the S5 and it didn't have regulation and wound up destroying a battery, then after changing the battery, I had to only charge it in the mornings before leaving, and not leave it on the charger.\nBut overall, \"I want to believe\". I want to like this phone, but have mixed feelings so far and want to know if these negatives can be corrected after release, because I have this phone now, and there's no going back. I have to pay for it, for 2 years, and wish I could sue Samsung for the S5 that wasted maybe $700 of my money!\nI'll see if I can update this post, depending on interest, and what else develops.\nTired Of Manufacturers Releasing Half Baked $700 Phones\nIn Denver\nMamaBear2014", "time": "05-07-2016 08:55 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5168511", "text": "That strange, mine has text saying \"Drag a circle in any direction\" above them, then when you are holding down it changes to something slightly different like \"Drag to outside of circle\".

Although there is a lot of noise around this phone, if you look at the threads with real owners on, the vast majority got good quality phones, with no issues, and are very happy with them. These tend to be one liners, whereas the negativity is repeated a lot, so looks bigger than it is. If you get another one, it could and should be perfectly fine. If you are putting a case on it, then nicking it should be less of an issue (I can see how the painted thing, will make it more susceptible to knocks).\nAlso, if you liked the wide angle camera, the HTC can't give you that, the G5 can, and is a USP that no-one else has right now. Likewise, IR blaster, removable battery, on screen buttons (my personal preference), fingerprint sensor on the back (preference) - if you like any of these features, then the G5 gives it to you. Or maybe you don't like antennae lines, which LG have very cleverly covered up - the first metal bodied phone to do that. I bet they wish they hadn't bothered now.\nSo... as I said, do what feels right for you. Don't just get an HTC because people have told you to, do it because you think its the right phone for you and you prefer its features over the G5s. Which other than a slightly better camera, and the feel of cold hard metal against your skin - which apparently is all the rage these days - i'm not sure what the 10's standout features are. Still a good phone, don't get me wrong.\nAnd just being facetious for a second, one of the early criticisms was this whole cold metal thing. If that's such a nice feeling, why don't case manufacturers make cold metal cases to put on your phone? Maybe, its because its not a very welcoming feeling. LGs primer on metal gives you the best of both worlds, premium metal, without the harshness.\nSo as I said, this isn't meant to be taken too seriously, but this is about as overly positive, as some of the overly negative posts are, just to balance things up.\nSeeing someone get talked out of a phone she clearly really liked so easily, made me feel a little bit sad inside. 1st post \"I'm loving this phone...\". 2nd and 3rd posts - \"get the HTC 10, get the HTC 10.....\" - \"Oh ok then\".", "time": "04-19-2016 03:29 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5134153", "text": "It seems like there's only a few threads where you can talk about the phone without the hate creeping in.

Completely blew my G3 out of the water! Wide angle shot, Wow, a feature I know I'd use. The clarity of the photos taken in store were superb. OS and overall performance! Yikes, this thing flies (although honestly my G3 isn't that far behind) but in every aspect of playing with the G5, buttery smooth and very snappy...a huge plus for me! Modularity. I popped out the battery and was very impressed. I am a spare battery advocate, finding myself without having a charging cable at my access. Locking mechanism very precise and closed the chin completely closed. Again, with a case on it, any small gap is irrelevant, and I'm not that OCD. The only minus I saw was a full brightness, my G3 was brighter (and whiter). Yep folks, I'm in. Sold on the upgrade, the G5 is, IMHO the best device out there. And I'll have a great backup with the G3 that has served me so faithfully well!!\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "05-09-2016 05:24 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5173310", "text": "nice review  it's an awesome phone that I can't fault.

Although I can find more faults in the G5, I prefer it - here's why. \nWhen both phones were released, I was really excited about the G5, the idea of a modular phone was exciting - even if it was just to remove and swap out the battery, but I've always been a Samsung guy, so the S7 edge seemed like a safer bet. Based on all the reviews I've read and all the hands-on videos I've watched, it seemed like I made the right decision, that was until I had a shot at playing with the G5. Overall design\nThe G5, to me, feels much better in the hand than the S7 edge - it's easier to hold and I can more or less complete any task one handed. I also don't need to worry about finger smudges. I've read quite a lot of complains about quality control on the G5, thankfully this didn't impact me - my phone is flawless with no dents or chips. I wen't with the Titan colour, which looks awesome. Software\nTouchwiz was a joy to use, so much so that I didn't feel the need to install a 3rd party launcher, with the G5 I instantly installed Action Launcher 3 as I needed an app drawer (my brain doesn't work without one) I've also replaced the stock LG keyboard, which wasn't good. With the S7 edge I didn't feel the need to change the keyboard. These are all minor things to me though, as much as I enjoy my phone working out of the box perfectly - I'm still going to install a launcher eventually. \nAs for lag, there was none on my S7 edge and there isn't any on my G5 - if I had to choose, which one was faster, I would say the G5 feels more snappier. Battery life\nI couldn't fault the S7 edge battery, it was excellent. I didn't need to worry about charging it through the day. I can also say the same for the G5 - considering this battery is much smaller, it still manages to last me throughout the day, with about 30% left before I charge it overnight. Obviously the S7e battery is better, but for what I use my phone for, the G5 is more than capable. \nIn the morning, I usually remove my phone from the charger about 6 am (my 6 month old Son is my alarm) I don't tend to use my phone until I get to work about 8:30 am. The G5 has amazing standby. So far, after having the phone for just over a week, I've removed my phone each time around about 6 am and by 8 am I'm still at 100% battery life - this wasn't possible with the S7 edge. Camera\nBoth cameras are brilliant; \n1) I miss the double tap of the home button to launch the camera, I just can't get used to the double tap of the volume rocker.\n2) I miss the instant focus that the S7 edge had. \nThese two features are very much missed, but what the S7 edge camera doesn't have that the G5 does is a brilliant wide angel camera. This is such a brilliant feature. One I didn't think I would as much. So much so that my next phone needs to have this feature. Conclusion\nI honestly couldn't fault the S7 edge - the battery life was excellent, the camera was great, the screen, as always, was bright and vibrant and Touchwiz good. I had the S6 edge for the best part of 2015, the S7 edge improved in all the failed areas, but after almost a month of using it, I got bored. The G5 is a breath of fresh air, it has a decent build quality, an excellent camera, excellent battery life and excellent screen. I don't care too much for the UI of LG, but that's easily changed. I'm also happy to be supporting a phone that dares to do something different, sure the modular part of the phone seems rushed, but I'm hoping, that in time, more developers jump on board to support this great idea.", "time": "04-25-2016 06:09 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5145084", "text": "Nice review\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "04-25-2016 09:02 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5145114", "text": "Thank you", "time": "04-25-2016 09:16 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5145110", "text": "I'm also coming from the S6 Edge and am loving my G5.\nThe battery life is very good and my free battery is coming today.

Well, I guess I was initially against it - or not quite enthused - because of my own selfish reasons. I LOVE the back button placement on my G3, so I was really disappointed when the G5 did not sport that feature (I get that not a lot of people may agree here, but this was just something I had grown to love about the G3, and the G4 has this as well; so I had been really hoping that the G5 would keep that trend that was quite unique to the G series - at least, its recent \"relatives\"). Also, I preferred the V10 to the G5, as I thought the screen size coupled with the double display were just sick. I was also a bit disappointed that it seemed to be a smaller display, as I really think the 5.5\" of my G3/the G4 was perfect for Netflix viewing, etc. But I just looked it up and the display of the G5 is apparently 5.3\", so that's not a dealbreaker.

But yeah, I've done some extra looking at the G5 and now I really can't say I'm \"against' it anymore. It's just different and it's arguably the most interesting phone of 2016 (I saw an article that coined the G5 as such, and I agree): there is so much \"controversy\" around it; and the reviews and comments about it state that for sure.\nI dunno, I can't say I'd buy it of yet without doing more research; but the phone itself certainly has merit and LG is known for making a unique and stand-out mobile brand, so we'll see!

Really clear, nice and bright, no issues with at all - and no light bleed even in a dark room.\n- The size for me is pretty much perfect. Its big, but not unwieldy.\n- Stupidly fast and smooth. I'm sure a lot of that is down to the SD820, but still. Yet to experience any lag or stutter in anything.\n- LG UI - its alright you know! I was worried coming from stock (Nexus 5), but the LG UI isnt too different, and most of the extras they've put on are useful. I do miss the stock speed dial favourites in the phone app, and the fact you can't choose None as a default notification tone was silly (I had to download a 1-second of silence tone), but I've found more things i'm glad of, than dislike. Pleasant surprise.\n- IR blaster and FM radio more useful than I expected\n- Removable battery and SD card are obviously both great\n- Fingerprint sensor is lightning fast, and very useful\n- Call quality is several notches up from the Nexus 5 - really clear. I think it must be the ear speaker\n- Also, the bottom firing speaker is really clear, and again, a significant upgrade for me.

I don't know how these people that claim to get 5 or 6 hours of SoT are doing it. For me, its about 2.5 hours. I do have bluetooth permanently on connected to my Huawei Watch, so maybe that doesnt help? Standby time is really good, but if you use a game, it drains fast. If anyone who has fantastic battery life wants to download Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, and play that for an hour, let me know what it does to your battery. Web browsing, facebook, and simple games its fine, but anything that taxes the graphics of the phone, in my experience, canes the battery.

I have used just about every flagship over the last 2 years ranging from the S7 edge, Moto X pure, LG G4, Galaxy Note 5, HTC m9, Nexus 6p, *ONE plus 2, iphone 6s and a few extras. So needless to say I have a good idea of what other phones are offering. Having said all of that I must add that this phone is something special. (I use a phone till I get bored with it and then buy a newish used one and sell the other).\nI flat out love this phone and plan on keeping it till the note 6 comes out.* I know what you are all are thinking that is not very long. Well for me it is considering that the longest I have held a phone for is 1.5 months. I know I have major problems.\nFor starters this phone is getting a lot of un fair flack about the build quality. I love the feel in my hand and let\u2019s be honest much like a good portion of the population I use a case and have found no flaw. (Poetic is by far the best on this phone).\nGetting the battery out is not hard and I never feel like I am going to break it. On the topic of battery life I must say that I am very pleased with the overall performance. It is not GS7 edge good but better than the other phones I listed.* I know that some of you will disagree and I completely agree that this is based solely on my usage.* In full disclosure I always turn off location settings and I disabled the always on display because I have this paired to my pebble time.\nMoving on to performance I have not had one hiccup in the nearly 3 weeks of ownership and have been nothing but pleased. When I initially set up the phone it did get pretty warn but It has not done that since.\nThe camera is amazing. I think it is the best one I have used. Again this is my opinion and other people will disagree.* The wide angle lens is really fun to play with. When I first got the phone I thought I would never use this feature but I find myself using it all the time and showing off the pictures. I have two kids and I have managed to get some pretty good shots of them running and jumping with no blur whatsoever.\nSpeaker is very loud. Not a whole lot of base but pretty darn good for a single firing speaking. I do miss the nexus 6p and moto x pure speakers but I am happy to trade these in for the removable battery.\n*Moving on this main reason I love this phone so much is for the removable battery.* My job sometimes requires me to work 18 hour shifts and I very rarely have a chance to be near an outlet. This meant that I had to carry a battery pack with me and plug the phone in and use it with the cord hanging out.* We can all agree that while this method works it is kind of a pain in the butt.* I love being able to simply pop in a new battery and go from 5% to 100% in under a minute.** I also like the method in slamming the battery back into the phone. I did 5 years in the marines and it kind of reminds me of slamming a magazine into the rifle.\nWell I hope this helped one person out there.

This phone is by far the most consistently smooth phone I've ever used which is a huge plus. I can't tell you how much of my time I've wasted trying to fix all the various lag issues with my past devices and all of them were flagship devices. Why? Because repeated lag when you are doing the simplest of tasks drives me nuts. You know it shouldn't lag. There's no logic to it lagging but yet it still happens. And you keep repeating the action. Doing it over and over. Trying to convince yourself that you are imagining the lag because how could the device lag doing something so simple? But you're not imagining it. The lag is real.

I returned both G5's and the module and will now look somewhere else.\nQuality control is a joke...\nSorry I was in a hurry this morning and I'd like to point out some positive and some negative issues: Just so you know, my daily driver ATM is the LG G2 and I (still) love it. I ordered the G5 in silver from Amazon germany with the CamPlus module as a pre-order bonus.\nThe first (not so very close) look and the in hand feel of the G5 was pretty good. The odd thing was, that just when the phone was delivered it had a really metal-like feel to it but after a few minutes that feeling changed as the device got warmer in my hand. It certainly does not feel like plastic, but once in hand it doesn't feel like metal either. This in-hand feel was neither positive nor negative for me. \nFor me personally the size of the phone is just right, the grip was good and it was not very slippery. The display was not too bad either but I can imagine, that the Samsung display is perceived as the better display. The camera was great and the wide-angle camera is breath-taking (IMHO). And, the phone is blazingly fast. My G2 starts to lag and just isn't too snappy anymore. I just cannot imagine the G5 ever being laggy. So, this is where the positive things end.\nWhat was striking, was the really bad finish / quality control. The first unit I received had chipping paint at the top of the gap (and I'm not talking about the antenna lines) and the bottom of the module looked dented. All in all, it was clear from looking at the device, that I could not keep it. So Amazon sent another one (together with the CamPlus) and here it was just the same story. Aditionally the finish or the quality control of the CamPlus was so bad that it wouldn't even stay in the G5. It just slipped out again and again. Just unusable.\nAnother thing was that the wifi and cell signal wasn't very strong, my G2 just does it better.\nI really looked forward to this phone but for 699\u20ac this was a major disappointment and these compromises in finish / quality control I'm not willing to take.", "time": "04-24-2016 02:58 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5143559", "text": "That's just terrible ......", "time": "04-24-2016 08:48 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5144341", "text": "The G5 is a good phone.

I have had it for about 2 days (jumped from G4) and my only complaint so far is I don't like having the on/off button and FP scanner in the same button, but that's a very minor complaint. I haven't done a side by side test, but the FP scanner seems to be a little quicker than my 5X. Overall this phone absolutely flies and I haven't experienced any lag anywhere. It's easier to hold without a case than the 6P or Nexus 6 and I would have preferred a polycarbonate body because I don't like or use cases, but I sure as heck will take aluminum over glass on the back which is the most ridiculous material for the back of a mobile device if you really think about it. Seems like Apple stopped doing that for some reason a few years ago. Don't get me wrong, I like Samsung and have had several of their phones. Anyway, there are no sharp edges that some have complained about and the bottom fits perfectly. It would be impossible to stick even the thinnest piece of paper in or around the bottom piece like some have done with pre-release models because there is no gap. My friend at TMobile has a G5 and hers has no gaps either so maybe this issue was rectified. The button that releases the bottom fits so perfectly you can't even feel it. It's really that tight and smooth.\nI prefer a front firing speaker(s), but the G5 gets very loud and has more volume than I will ever need. Apparently LG has done an excellent job with the antennas because my office is notoriously bad for all carriers and my G5 signal is stronger than all of my previous phones which also includes a Nexus 5, and Note 4.\nThe screen is excellent and gets very bright (seems like I read 850 nits somewhere?) and easily beats everything else I've had for outside use and battery life seems like it will fine, but time will tell. I only swapped batteries maybe 6 times in the 11 months I had the G4, but it sure was and will be nice having this feature. Charging keeps getting faster, but nothing beats the ability to pop in a fully charged battery in seconds.\nI have used Nova Launcher on every phone since my Note 4 so I can't comment on what LG has done with the G5, but I doubt I'd like it. The cameras (all three) are excellent as expected and I was surprised to find out I was getting a free 360 Cam even though I probably won't use it beyond the first day. I applaud LG for trying something different though, but outside of the VR I really don't think anything else will sell. They need to go back to a removable back with the G6 and make it feel like the Nexus 5 or 5X, but they won't because form always wins over function in the smartphone business. I love my 5X, but the speed of this device is just amazing and might be a keeper.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "04-24-2016 09:23 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5145423", "text": "Yep... you are quite right.

Not sure why, interference concerns with video sounds recording? or maybe just a bugette.\nThe quick remote setup is very clever. You just tell the phone what type and brand of device it is, and it then asks you to try a few buttons, and you tell it if it worked or not. In my experience it only asks a few times, then works out exactly what setup your device needs. You can configure multiple remotes and organise them in multiple rooms, with tabs to switch remotes.

I tallied my scores and the S7 Edge wins over the other two pretty easily. That does not necessarily mean that I like using it better than the G5. I like the feel and use of the G5 better and it has some really good features, but some significant shortcomings, as well. \nFirst, the battery life of the G5 is just not good, especially compared to the S7 Edge. I know the battery is smaller and is swapable, but having an extra battery to swap out is just not as good as having a good strong battery. This is a significant issue.\nSecond, the G5's wifi antennae is not good. As others have noted, wifi on the G5 is very flaky. It continuously connects and disconnects when near the edge of its range and its range is not good. I have connectivity issues in areas of lower signal, but where the other phones have stayed connected without issue.\nI like the feel of the G5 in the hand much better. It feels very good and is comfortable to use. The edge screen can cause handling issues and I do not like the physical home button on the Samsungs. The fingerprint reader is very good and easy to use on the G5. \nThere is no comparison between the screens. Samsung wins easily. Incidentally, the auto brightness on the G5 is perhaps the worst auto brightness implementation I have ever seen on a phone. It is painfully slow to adjust and just does not work. It sometimes throttles my screen down to 0 when I have decent lighting. \nThe G5 wins for camera for me, but they are very close. \nI like how fast the G5 is, but the huge icons and characters are just unacceptable, especially for a smaller screen. Most of them can be changed using Nova, but the notification shade and others cannot. The icons should not take up the entire notification shade. \nPeople dog Touchwiz, but it is really a non-factor for the most part. With the use of Nova or Apex and the ability to disable apps, TW is not an issue for me. The S7 Edge is very fast (the S6E+ not so much). It is not as fast or smooth as the G5, but that is not much of a problem. \nI am a business user and rely heavily on the email, calendar, contacts (through exchange) and phone apps. The LG email app works fine, but all emails sent through exchange have tiny 10 pt font. This has been an LG problem for a long time. Font type can be changed through Microsoft Word (of all places), but not the size. It looks terrible. LG's calendar app is awful, particularly compared to Samsung's. Finally, I do not like how LG's phone and contacts apps do not have a dedicated tab for favorites, like most others. They are listed at the top, but it is not quite as easy to get to the favorites. There are apps in the app store that can replace these apps, but they are not the same as having all of them stock and well-integrated. \nThe modules for the G5 are just not a factor. Being able to swap batteries is a decent feature, but I cannot imagine using any others. \nI am undecided about keeping the G5, There are a lot of things to like and it is not as bad as some have indicated, but it just misses on quite a few things. I have a few more days to decide. I also pre-ordered the HTC 10 and will see how it compares. At the end of all of this I will have the S7 Edge and one other that I will use.

There's a couple reasons I ask. First, I've had an S5 for 2 years now and have never had that complaint (and btw, I'm probably going to get a G5 as replacement because of the replaceable battery). Next, I remember about 4 years ago I got a new Nexus and it had TONS of mic problems (during calls, my mic would mute and they couldn't hear me). It turns out that the problems were region specific (it had to do with the towers or something like that). I had looked it up in forums, and there were only problems in specific regions of the country.\nTo finish that story, I was under warranty, so I had free replacements. My choice was between the Nexus or the Galaxy S3 initially, and they wouldn't budge on giving me an S3 as a replacement (they would offer a lesser phone). So, I kept sending the phone back. I went through SEVEN Nexus phones. I kept telling them unless you give me an S3, then I'm just going to keep exchanging the phone as soon as it has a problem (and they had to overnight a replacement each time).

I've been doing a lot of web searching, and it sounds pretty bad. I was iPhone before my Nexus 5, so have never actually moved from Android to Android, and assumed all game data would just be seamlessly copied over. It sounds like unless you root your device and use Titanium backup, things are pretty painful. Lollipop's NFC based Tap & Go says it will resync your app data, but many websites seem to say that very few apps actually support this feature. Unless the app developer deliberately coded their app to sync data, it will be lost.\nSo, can anyone clarify what my real world experience is likely to be like moving over, and share any useful tips? Is there any kind of knowledge base out there somewhere, which logs which apps copy data, and which don't (And presumably some can do this themselves via Facebook or Google Play, or their own proprietary method), and even better, how to do it manually. If not, someone should create one. Sounds like it would be useful :-)\nI'm pretty happy that my contacts, email accounts, text history, will all be copied over via my Google account, but the thought of losing game progress on things i've played for years, is not good.\nCheers,\nKevin", "time": "04-11-2016 11:19 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5134641", "text": "Well, I finally got my new G5 today. \nI can officially say Android totally sucks at moving phones. If this is how good Android backup and restore is, I hope i never lose my phone, as it doesn't restore anything. You basically get your apps and contacts, and that's it. Anything extra seems to be down to the apps themselves saving data somewhere.\nThe G5 setup will ask you if you want to transfer from another phone, and then you touch them back to back. All this does is transfer your google account info, and the apps themselves (without data) start installing one at a time on the phone. However, they are placed completely randomly, ignoring whatever folders you may have had. Luckily I used Nova for the last half of the phone's life, and there is hope there.\nSMS - As I used Google hangouts, I assumed this would copy across. Nope! It copies hangouts conversations, but not SMS. Used an app called SMS backup and restore to copy across via Google Drive. Then restart hangouts, and all is back.\nCall history - Nope. But the SMS Backup and restore will copy that for you too. Looks like it all came over.\nNova - On your old phone, backup the layout to google drive, then restore to your new phone. All floders and apps came down, but the dialler and camera were missing, which left 2 blank icons in my quick tray at the bottom. Slightly strange. Maybe Nexus and G5 are different apps. So I had to copy the dialler and camera apps into the tray from the app drawer\nAccounts - Only the Google account came across into \"Accounts & Sync\". I have 11 accounts in total in this section, and only Google made it. Unbelievable. I guess this is a slow process of logging back into every other app.\nMail - This thankfully was all setup from the google account and worked fine, with both my email accounts.\nContacts - Yes, these seem to have come with the google account.\nPhotos - I use Google Photos, so those are visible, but nothing was copied locally by the back to back sync thing. i understand LG Backup will copy these, as well as CloneIt, and i'm sure lots of other apps do a similar thing. I might just start afresh.\nChrome - had forgotten all bookmarks and history, but once i'd closed and reopened they all came back.\nGames - Havent tried many so far, but it doesnt look promising. 2048 - My awesome highscore that took months and months of gameplay, gone. Wordbrain - Probably close to a year of progress, also gone. Skyforce - As soon as I logged into google and facebook account within the game, it remembered everything. phew. Fallout shelter - Gone. But sounds like I can copy a local file. \nGoogle - You need to sort your act out. This is leagues behind what Apple does. Your new phone basically looks exactly like your old one. Yes, I know that's easier for them because they own the hardware and software and there is no choice, but i'm sure we can do a lot better than this sorry tale of woe.\nAnyway, I hope that helps at least one person who stumbles across this thread.

My Verizon G5 shows a little 4G or 3G symbol next to the signal strength bars even when I'm on WiFi. I get poor reception in my basement, so even when I'm on WiFi, I will see the 4G change to 3G sometimes. Also, I notice that your WiFi icon is different than mine, as mine has the up/down arrows below the WiFi icon, not in it. So maybe your carrier doesn't display the 4G/3G/1x icons for the data signal.\nAnyhow, the reason I'm wondering about your data signal strength is that I get significantly less battery life at home where my signal strength is poor than I do at work, where I can see the cell tower from my office window. At work, I lose about 2-3% an hour and sometimes the battery graph flat-lines for a while. But at home, I loose about 5% an hour and in my basement, where the signal strength is really poor, it's closer to 7% an hour.

I did receive shipping info yesterday and will get my handset today... but my bundle shipped today. The one good bit of info I can hopefully give you is it will more than likely be to you the very next business day... that very sadly is going to be Monday. I'm so very sorry bro. \nI'll take time to type what I had to go through to be sure my phone came today. \nI literally tried to be the very first person to pre order the phone. I still have a g2 that has 1080p display and outstanding battery life. So when the g3 and g4 came out... I got them, but returned each one within the 14 days because of the huge drain of the qhd display vs 1080p and the performance difference IMHO wasn't there.\nI only mention this so you can have some idea of just how excited I am to get this phone!! I had picked up the g4 for $1 and had to make the tough choice of wiaitng for g5 or keeping g4 and being stuck with 808 for 2 more years... I bit the bullet and held out!! Wiiiishing for a 5.3 with removable battery, even wiiiishing for extra battery and cradle which all came to be!!! \nSo, like I was saying before I was super geeked out and I literally watched the button turn from coming soon in grey, to pre order in yellow!!!! I ordered at 1:30am on the 18th and was stoked I had the phone and only needed to wait until it arrived. \nI debated on in store pickup and shipping. But having read that so many get the device early when choosing to have it shipped... I couldn't resist!!! \nNeedless to say I received an email from BB Corporate on the 21st saying that they had realized the accessory bundle wasn't included with my pre order so they had added it. It went on to specifically say no further action was needed from me... even to enjoy my new phone. (I know this is long, but this is where it gets interesting)\nI then, always wanting to prevent any issues ahead of time... go to my best buy orsr status to be sure they did actually add the accessory bundle. Thing is, when I look at my order... they had added the bundle. But while doing this, they had canceled my pre order of the phone!!!!\nIf I hadn't checked, I would have literally received a bundle with no handset!!! Because I am on top of the situation... I'm one of the first people to call into best buy about it. I spend 6 hours that evening trying to figure out how they can add the phone back onto my pre order so I don't lose my \"place\" in pre order line.\nAfter 6 hours of stress I fiiiinally speak with a guy in the mobile back office that says corporate made the mistake, and once it was cancelled the only way to get it back was to cancel the entire ore order and re pre order the phone.\nSo I very reluctantly agree to let him do this and after he cancels the order and makes certain my upgrade with sprint is good to go. I hang up and try to re place the pre order of the phone. (Big buzzer sound)... \nNo matter what I try, phone lap top, different browser, deleting cookies and cache, I can not re pre order the phone. More calls... bb ends up closing... I write emails to customer service for help... even president of customer experience. (Still to this day have yet to get any response... inspite of an automatic response that confirms they had received my emails). Nothing.\nFiiinally around 1:30 am on the 22nd I could re ore order the handset. This time the accessory bundle was included... and with free shipping I'd have the phone for the first. \nTuesday comes, I start to get excited and am checking my order to see if I'll get lucky and receive shipping info early... I end up finding out that free shipping is going to get me the phone for the 5th and the only way I can guarantee I'll have it the 1st is to upgrade shipping to expedited shipping which is ups 2nd day. I don't like it but $12 isn't keeping me from getting my phone so I pay.\nWednesday evening rolls around and no shipping info!?!? They had promised if I paid more, I'd have it with the ups two day shipping upgrade. I go online and findnout that expedited only guarantees me for the 4th(Monday) and the only way I could get it the first was to pay for express shipping ups next day air... I paid.\nYesterday comes, my order still hasn't moved. I called to best buy asked for a superviser.... before I spoke... I asked him...\"Sir, can you tell me why a customer would want to place a pre order with best buy!? Could you tell me what are the advantages of placing a ore order? I mean what would you expect if you placed a ore order for an item!?\" \nHe answered me and told me everything any normal person would want to hear. So I aksed him.... then why is it with my ore order all Ive managed to do is order myself a whole nightmares owrth of headaches... and I went on to tell him everything you've read above. \nI finished with, if I can't have a tracking number by end if your business day today that promises the phone will be Herr on time tomorrow... I want the order cancelled. DO NOT send me a tracking number that says my ore order will be here on the 4th... as once its shipped, I'll be forced to wait until it arrives... I can't go to the store while you have me tied up with a ore order. \nBy 5pm yesterday I had a tracking number for the phone!!!!\nThe kicker is, this morning when I woke up to check status on the accessory bundle... it had moved to back ordered!?!?! So allllllll that mess and headaches to add an accessory bundle to my ore order that they wouldn't even have!?!?!?!! \nWhen I called this morning and told them that one.... the rep didn't even know what to say. I let him off easy, as I'm thankful for the phone and he did assure at the very earliest possibility... the would get me the bundle. This evening... I received shipping info for it as well!!!\nLet this epic drama... Typos and all serve as what may or may not happen to you... should you choose to ore order a handset with BB in the future!! \nI am not in any way shape or form a rude or grumpy or whatever kind of person....

This one just isn't - and the parts aren't that great to begin with.Bottom line: You get a phone with a decent screen, decent camera, bad battery life, bad physical and software design, poor record on security and updates, poor build quality and some \"optional\" features that should have been included standard. The volume buttons are on the wrong side, power button is duplicate function as FPS (fail), front bottom bezel isn't the same color/material as the top bezel and isn't flush, blah, blah, blah - long story short, #nope.\nI know I'm being harsh, but this is your flagship.

LG's Ken Hong (who I know pretty well, for who may question his legitimacy \u2014 YouTube cracks me up sometimes) replied in the YT comments. Short version is that's paint and primer coming off first, before you get to the metal. Here's Ken's comment:\nAll that said, I completely agree that the phone doesn't particularly feel like metal. And that makes sense, because you're feeling paint and primer on the outside. The metal's on the inside. I think the marketing lines are definitely a little vague (as they tend to be), and perhaps borderline misleading.\nFrom the current G5 product page: \"The LG G5 ... boasts a metal alloy body.\" And it does. Just, uh, not on the outside. And I think that's pretty apparent the second you pick it up. If if was metal through and through, it'd be about the cheapest metal I'd ever felt. \nKen points folks toward the press release, too. You get lines like \"sleek, metal uni-body\" and \"sleek metal aluminum body.\"\nA more damning line in the presser may be \"Third, the 3D Arc Glass featured in the smartphone\u2019s 5.3-inch display creates a gentle curve and a smooth colorful metal surface through an advanced microdizing process which takes anodized aluminum to a whole new level.\" That's definitely confusing at best.\nIn addition to vague marketing language, I think part of the problem might be that folks were poring over the press releases and marketing message (which \u2014 by the way, are designed to make everything sound great!) before actually holding the phone. For what it's worth, I (and others) did the opposite. We saw the G5 in Barcelona before the press release was sent out.\nI'm still working on our review. But I don't mind sharing that it absolutely is going to say that the G5 may be metal unibody, but it definitely feels not like anything you've used from Apple or HTC or Huawei, or even Honor (the Honor 5X has some cheap-feeling metal in the scheme of things).\ntl;dr It's metal, coated in primer and paint, as part of this \"advanced microdizing process,\" \u2014 which LG never really explained to us in our briefings (even when pushed).

We know that phones are not \"all-metal\". Metal phones incorporate some parts made out of plastic to help with antenna reception. The HTC One M7 had plastic sides and antenna bands to help with reception. The iPhone 6 and 6s also had antenna bands made out of plastic, alongside the Huawei phones. However, with those phones, you are feeling metal since they are dyed aluminum. \nIn the case of the G5, to go alongside with the \"microdizing\" process on the LM201b aluminum, they painted it in a similar way to how a car is painted, by applying primer for the paint to stick and then putting the final coat. The result is that the G5 doesn't exactly feel like the One series or the Mate 8, and to those who have used those before, it feels odd and some might be put off by it. Simply put, it's different and not everyone likes it. And to be frank, Android Authority posted that headline when everyone thought it was indeed plastic. They probably should change it after the matter is cleared up, but the original one is still there. \nAnd let's talk about the Android Police review. I'll be honest here. I actually agree with many points of the review, but I won't go into detail here because I'm not going to rant about stuff. AP's statement in the chin gap existing on every G5 is a bit of a stretch, but every unit I've seen has a gap between the chin module and the rest of the phone. The only thing is that they vary in size, so it's either more obvious or less obvious than the other. I know many here won't mind it, but as a person with OCD (seriously, I have a pretty bad case of OCD, it's not even funny), it really bugs me. But my biggest concern is the backlight bleed. More than a few units looks to have suffered from pretty bad bleed. The thin glass panel also causes the LCD to bloom in some cases. I know not everyone cares or has a unit that doesn't suffer from backlight bleed as bad, but to me, ehhhhh....it's not a good first impression.\nAll I can hope is that LG takes these concerns seriously and makes sure that future batches don't suffer from as much quality issues. To me, after having 2 G4s with serious quality control issues, seeing QC issues in the G5 just doesn't make me confident. *sigh*", "time": "04-04-2016 10:14 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5114348", "text": "Last Premium phone from LG was the V10.

That edge display has no practical applications whatsoever. They tried the same approach with the TVs, and sadly, very few liked it. The modular design is a functional paradigm shift, it's hard to see the full potential with only a few modules available. The paradigm gives hardware engineers a platform to come up with something special, and only time will tell the true potential of this venture. \nAs for battery life, with that small of a margin in amperage, bigger is not always better. Besides, the battery life discussion is a little too early to call considering the G5 is faster & much more energy effiecient than what most people would expect. An average user doesn't really need to have their phone to last for days at a time. Personally, battery life is not even a factor for me.

The current unit has started chalking up issues like overheating and failing to receive cellular network signals when other phones on the same network are able to. Given the quality issues with the G4, I hoped that LG would make sure that the G5 would have better quality control, but based on first-impressions, it seems that they haven't really done so, and I'm really disappointed in that.\nJust let me be clear. I'm actually not that big on the heavy coat of primer on the body of the phone (now that Ken from LG has clarified it and told us something that made much more sense than some of the marketing material, as usual for me). It's the other quality issues that bug me, especially the backlight bleeding and the rather thin LCD panel that causes the LCD itself to \"bloom\" when touched at times. I mean, sure. There's more good units out there than bad ones, but those look like a higher-than-normal rate for defective batches, and that doesn't give me confidence.\nAll I can hope now is that LG takes these quality concerns much more seriously in the future, because a $600+ phone needs top-notch quality. First-impressions are hard to erase and with these videos making rounds, they need to convince prospective buyers that the G5 is actually well-built by making sure future batches ARE indeed well-built.\nAs for me, I'm actually going to the Samsung camp with the Note 6.

At least enough time for you to make some comments about using the camera module.

I work in the Tech industry and know how these devices get built and it is almost like LG took a group of first year engineers and told them to build a modular phone. It is obvious it was rushed. This is not like LG at all. They draw from the same pool of engineers and workers that Samsung does. \nWTF LG, this isn't the same people who built the V10", "time": "04-04-2016 12:49 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5104099", "text": "According to a comment by an LG rep who goes by the name of Ken, what you're actually feeling is a layer of primer and paint. They used an aluminum alloy called LM201b, designed primarily for automobiles and aircraft, as it is both light and strong. \nUnlike other metal phones, which are anodized and dyed to a specific color, LG did something different and used a new technique called \"Microdizing\" and painted the aluminum body in a different way, more akin to how one would spray-paint a car.\nNet result is a metal phone that doesn't feel like a metal phone as you're really feeling the paint and primer, and it is apparently not as scratch-resistant as anodized + dyed aluminum.\nI don't understand why LG hasn't tried this on a lower-volume product before doing so on their higher-volume flagship device. It doesn't feel \"premium\" to me. Feeling the V10 and the G5 together makes the G5 feel somewhat \"cheapskate\" by comparison.\nAnd looking at the defective units, it's pretty obvious that it was rushed.

And they like the finish.Love the phone. The internet loves drama and about 75% of the hype around the quality usually can tossed right out the window. Lastly, I get irritated at the mob mentality. Meaning, some people like you post logical posts and concerns about the quality, where as many are just posting to beat down LG just for the fun it, so they can beat their chest about how great their Samsung phone is. They don't add anything to the discussion, nor have they ever considered buying an LG. \nThose are the people my post was mostly directed towards. I also think people need to stand back a little and decide if the flaws are as bad as some would have you believe and this might actually be a very good phone.

I have a few comments about it.\n(1) It's not the same price as the 5.1\" S7, at least not on my carrier (T-Mobile). It's closer to a $600 ($630) phone than it is a $700 (S7 is $700). That's a 10% difference and it should be noted that the 5.5\" S7 (Edge) is $779 and in a completely different price all together. So if you factor in screen size, they are definitely not the same price.\nSprint $576 v $649\nVerizon $624 v $672\nOnly on AT&T is it inexplicably the same price, and you all agreed that both should be sent back because of how they handle bloatware. I don't disagree with that.\n(2) I'm pretty sure the reason why the Camera module is not more ergonomic like DSL cameras is because with the wide angle lens flush to the body, your knuckles, if not the grip too, would show up in the photos. A wide angle lens on a DLS camera stands out from the body and can accommodate the grip.\n(3) I'm not having the same build quality issues, but after hearing all of them I did put a case on my phone, which I haven't done in years. Then again, I'm not planning on using any modules yet as none attract me (at the right price range), so I'm not anticipating the constant swapping that might me causing Phil's cracking frame problem. But since LG did market it as a \"friends\" device that could be a problem going forward.\nI guess my take away was that not everybody bought this phone for the modules - some people saw it as the best buy for a phone at the right size (5.3\") and the right price ($630) with the Snapdragon 820. I felt the S7 was too small at 5.1\" and couldn't justify the $780 for the Edge. I don't have to buy or use the modules, I don't need water resistance and the ability change a (free) battery is a nice plus (I averaged once or twice a month with the G4) in emergency situations.\nI am having a ton of fun with the wide angle lens, they threw in a free 360Cam and, honestly I really feel like I got an amazing bargain of a phone for $630.", "time": "04-08-2016 05:07 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5113431", "text": "Of course it got posted while I was typing this out:Android Central 282: All things LG G5 | Android Central", "time": "04-08-2016 05:10 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "What type of USB port does the LG G5 have?", "thread": [{"postID": "post5113111", "text": "Does the LG G5 come with the standard USB port for phones?

Here's what I think of the LG G5 from initial impressions. (No, I didn't buy the phone. I'm basing it based on what I've seen and used for a short period of time)\nAs you could guess from the headline, it's not very rosy, but that doesn't mean it's a terrible phone. In a nutshell, it's a pretty good phone plagued with early quality issues on a fair number of units.\nNow, the phone itself seems to be built quite well as it feels somewhat solid and doesn't bend, but if you're used to metal phones, this one is going to feel a bit like a plastic one. Not because it's not metal, but because it's painted differently from other metal phones. Other metal phones are usually dyed aluminum, while the G5 uses primer and a top layer of paint for its color. It's going to feel different but personally, I'm not big on how a phone feels, but I know that some people will be put a little off by it. But this is the part where I'm going to have pitchforks and torches thrown at me, but I don't think the G5 is a looker. Even though I slap a case on my phone (which is why those humps don't bother me), the camera module just looks weird to me. It kinda looks like 2 confused robot faces. After seeing a Photoshopped version of it, it's hard to not see the resemblance and I get mini-nightmares from it. Okay, maybe it doesn't look that bad, but it's just weird to me.\nSoftware is typical LG to me. It performs really well, with little to no lag, smooth transitions, butter-smooth performance and snappy response. BUT, I don't think it actually improved in terms of looks. Now, there are some improvements as I LOVE the new status bar icons and camera UI, but everything else is....uhhhhhhhh....pre-Marshmallow TouchWiz-like? I could live with the teal + white color, but I dislike the increased usage of the color white throughout the UI. Like, why LG? Why not add an optional dark theme for some of us who want an easier UI for the eyes? Looks aside, it's a snappy performer.......but I hope Dual Window returns in Android N, where Google has finally adopted that feature. THANK YOU!\nHere are a couple of smaller points. Camera is still awesome even thougn it's the same 16MP f/1.8 Sony Exmor RS IMX234 shooter from the G4, and the 8MP wide-angle lens camera is cool and is quite fun to use at times. The SD820 seems to be a spritely little performer from what I've seen AND that IPS Quantum display still looks great today.\nBUT, that's where the issues begin. While that display LOOKS great, backlight bleeding seems to be an issue on some units. I've seen a couple of phones exhibiting pretty bad bleed usually around the bottom. It varies between units, so I suspect this is a batch-related issue. Another issue is that the thin glass panel can cause the LCD to bloom at times if you touch the screen. I don't think this is a gigantic deal, but it might bug some guys with OCD (like me). I'm not going to talk about the gap between the module and the rest of the phone, or the seams at the back of the phone or other quality issues since I think it's been thrown around so many times already.\nSo, here's my initial thoughts summed up.It's a phone with a lot of potential to be one pretty good phone. It just needs more quality polish. That's it. Some people who have the phone here seem to have good units with little flaws, so I hope that future batches will be like that. And it needs to be, after the whole G4 bootloop fiasco.\nAnyway, that concludes my initial thoughts based on what I have seen and used (for a pretty short period). That might change when I actually get one for more than a few minutes a few months down the road when LG's quality control (hopefully) improves.\nSo please don't hate me.....yet.", "time": "04-06-2016 04:22 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5107635", "text": "Don't hate you but mini nightmares???\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "04-06-2016 04:38 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5107645", "text": "It was a bit of an exaggeration, but looking at the back of the phone keeps reminding me of that robotic face.

Both times, I woke up in the middle of the night and noticed that the red charging LED was still on even though it should have complete charging long before. Both times, the lock screen said it was charging. However, when I look at the battery graph, it shows that it charged up to about 85% and then started discharging again, while it was plugged in and while it claimed it was charging.\nOn both nights, I unplugged it and plugged it back in. The first night, it charged to 100% after that and was still at 100% when I woke up. Last night however, it again charged to around 85% and then started discharging. I've attached a picture showing the charging graph.\nThis was the 5th night I've had the phone, and I don't remember it happening on the first 3 nights. I'm still debugging it, but one thing that changed 2 nights ago was I started using a 6 foot cable from Amazon at night. Another thing that changed was that I turned on the always-on display on Sunday.\nThe charger I'm using on my nightstand is an old Droid Max charger that I've used for years. It has 2 port and I use one for my phone and one for my Pebble Round. Another odd thing I noticed last night was that my Pebble Round's backlight came on several times while I was getting ready for bed. I thought the cable was loose, but it did it a few more times after I re-positioned the cable. The charger says that it's output is 5.1V at 750mA. I'm guessing that a total of 750mA across both ports, since that seems to be how chargers are rated.\nMaybe my phone is overloading the charger, but I would have thought it should work fine with older chargers. The 6 foot cable I'm using is some off-brand from Taiwan that I got from Amazon, but I was careful to choose one that was reviewed by the Googler, Benson Leung, and he said that it met spec.\nHere's my battery graph.

I have a favorite metal purse which a taller phone won't fit in, and that's close to a deal breaker. So as much as my aging eyes like the larger phones, I leave that to my tablet.\nMy reasons for choosing the G5 over the oh-so-sexy S7 Edge (I'd want the larger Edge over the standard).\n- G5 looks to be a bit sturdier. I rarely drop my phone, but it does happen. Due to the above size constraint, I'd be rocking a slim case. I am skeptical that would save a glass front/glass back phone from a drop onto concrete. A crack, even not interfering with use, would drive me nuts. The G5 is certainly breakable, but just doesn't seem quite as delicate as the S7.\n- Replaceable battery. I most likely won't have to swap batteries between chargings. But, I do like to replace the battery when it holds significantly less charge than when it was new. My trusty Galaxy S4 has gotten three new batteries in it's life.\n- LCD screen. OLED is beautiful, but can suffer burn in. I have a bit on my S4, mostly from games. I'd rather not worry about it.\n- LG Friends. Cool, but just a plus. Will use the camera grip for vacation, as much for the extended battery as the camera buttons. And the LG rolling robot thing - will buy just to entertain the household pets. Just a plus.\nThe S7 Edge is a nice piece of tech, but for me the LG G5 is a better bet. Also, I'm on a Verizon UDP, so I buy the phone outright (I know there is a delayed payment thing, but I just buy it), so unless there is a compelling advancement in tech that I absolutely must have, I'll be keeping the phone three or more years.

Also, R.I.P. back volume buttons.\n- Why is the top bezel ginormous? \n- I'm actually really happy that LG kept the removable battery, even with a metal unibody design. That's thinking outside the box.\n- Still not really feeling about those modules. I think they're too limited and as of right now, look pretty gimmicky.\n- Snapdragon 820, 32GB UFS storage, 4GB of LPDDR4, microSD card slot, 5.3-inch QHD IPS display, blah blah blah. Typical high-end specs.\n- It has a Type-C charging port. THANK HEAVENS!\n- Somehow, LG managed to take several steps back with their software. DPI is still overly large and the lack of an app drawer is really weird. Kinda feel like this is one device where Nova is an instant install. The always-on displays looks promising, though.\n- Camera is still awesome\n- Another one of those phones where the battery got smaller.....\n- But it does do quite a few things very differently, and that gets high praise from me.\nSo those are my impressions.

Here's why, based on the G4:\n- The phone looks horrendous. The design looks like the result of drunk s*x between an iPhone and a generic Chinese device.\n- The UI is horrendous! Not only everything went white instead of darker, the lack of the app drawer is inadmissible on Android, making the G5 UI look just like another iPhone rip off. And yes, there are Launchers etc etc etc. But normal users don't use Launchers and they'll have a diminished experience. And no, I don't buy the \"market research\" excuse.\n- It loses Qi charging, which I'm not OK with at all.\n- It seems to lose the IR blaster too.\n- It still lacks a dedicated camera button built into the body of the phone.\n- USB-C. This would be a complete deal breaker to me if the UI hadn't done it already. USB-C offers zero REAL advantages over a microUSB. On the other hand it gives you an enormous headache because it renders all your home cables useless.\n- The battery was reduced but they kept a 2K display. I don't care how well the SD820 may be with energy management, the only way battery life should go is UP. Never stay the same or go down.\nNow the only (few) good things I think there are on the G5.\n- The modular idea is good. But it will need true investment in it. The modules they presented are nice but neither has a \"wow\" factor to it. Specially the camera grip which is just an inferior version of what Nokia had already done with the Nokia 1020 camera grip.\n- The end of the volume buttons on the back is definitely a good thing to me.\n- So is the end of back-facing speakers\nOverall, I have no intention of buying the G5. Specially when the likes of the S7 present a much better package this time around (even if the camera won't be as good).\nMy only concern going forward is if LG will try to shove their horrible new UI down G4 user's throats.

My guess is that LG will sell a few over-priced camera modules to vacationers, but almost no way-overpriced B&O modules (B&O is synonymous with overpriced style over function). I'd much rather see a better built-in 24bit DAC and more powerful amp in the phone itself. \nThe handicap of the missing app drawer can be party overcome by using a mega-folder to store misc apps that you don't use often, but I'm wondering how they'll handle widgets. Some of the apps that I use daily offer the choice of 3-5 widgets and I don't want them all dumped on the desktop.\nI'm pretty happy with my LG G4 so I'll wait for in-depth review and battery life reports before I make up my mind about upgrading to the G5.", "time": "02-21-2016 01:42 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5007142", "text": "You can't have a megafolder, folders are restricted to 16 icons", "time": "02-21-2016 01:48 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5007183", "text": "Look at the LG G5 software reviews", "time": "02-21-2016 02:02 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5007185", "text": "Smaller screen is a step up for me.", "time": "02-21-2016 02:02 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5007303", "text": "I love the modular approach, it is thinking outside of the box and way different then any other large smartphone manufacturer.. \nBut...2800Mah? ..Really?

I have not traded up partly due to those two things, and partly because it can still hold it's own speed wise (for the most part, although with the new snapdragon 820 and 4gb ram that is most likely not the case anymore). However, it is starting to show its age and the non removable battery is not lasting anywhere near as good as it used to. I switched to the G2 from a Galaxy S2, and I prefer LG software vs Touchwiz. \nI have really been looking forward to the G5 and really thought this would be my next phone, however, after watching both the G5 and S7 launches, I think I am leaning towards the S7. The waterproof ip68 sounds really nice (thinking about out in the rain, water slide park with the kids, etc) and from a design perspective, the S7 has a much more refined look. I must admit that the release version of the G5 is much better looking than some of the leaked pictures showed, however, it does not look anywhere near as nice as the S7 (in my opinion).\nThe biggest let down for me is the screen to body ratio and bezels. Even though the bottom bezel appears small at first glance, when you see the screen on, you realize that there is also a black portion of the bezel on top of the detachable part that really stands out and resembles an HTC (not knocking HTC, I have really liked everything other than their bezels on their phones) phone type bezel to go along with the large top bezel. Also, the side edges of the screen don't appear to get as close to the edge as the G2 or the S7 (non edge). I did not upgrade to the G3 or 4 due to the larger size (length and width, I think the width bothers me more) in comparison to the G2, the S7 wins here as well. Even though the S7 (non edge) is only 5.1 I think it will feel at least the same or maybe slightly larger than the G2's 5.2 because the navigation buttons are below and not actually taking up screen real estate. Although the S7 screen to body ratio is also not as good as the G2, it is slightly better. I wish they would upgrade the G2, keeping the dimensions, but upgrading the specs! The smaller battery, 2800 on the G5, is also not as good as the S7 and G2's 3000, sigh...\nI am going to reserve my final decision for when I see the full software review. From the initial look, it seems that touchwiz is much improved and LG may have taken one step forward and two steps back so to speak. When the full reviews come out I will know for sure. I appreciate LG's innovative thinking, but I really think they missed the mark on this one for me. Seems they spent too much time and energy on what I see as gimmicky attachments (I know some may disagree, this again is just my opinion) and not enough on upgrading the software experience and refining the design. \nThe G5 is a good start, but it looks like it needs another iteration to really shine.", "time": "02-21-2016 06:15 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5007714", "text": "Yes, the Snapdragon 800 was a beast.

I thought the G4 was close to perfect (battery life was so so).\nI was really pulling for LG with the G5. They could have learnt a thing or two from HTC. Okay that sounds crazy, but I am referring to the HTC One M7. It was a quality phone (the camera, not so much). No bells and whistles. Good build quality. Excellent overall phone. No stutter issues. Smooth UI. If LG had stuck to the basics, updated the build quality, improved their already excellent camera, increase the battery size, included none of the LG and friends, or the modular stuff or gimmicks, and toned down the UI, then they would have been fine. Give Samsung and Apple credit. Their upgrades are usually clearly upgrades (the S6 an exception maybe). Folks are looking for the basics. Is the battery life better? Build quality and appearance? Display? Some changes in the G5 will bother folks (getting rid of the app drawer would bug me, but the next release of Android may go in that direction, and the S7 has that feature as an option) but, again I credit them for trying something new. \nWhat also troubles me is the decrease in battery size. The G4 in my hands wasn't too bad. But if you use your phone, moderately, the battery drained pretty quickly. Same with the G3. So I find it troubling that the G5 has a smaller capacity battery. Add the always on display that \"only drains 0.3-0.8% per hour\" (LG's estimates) and that is pretty significant drain. On the low end that is 7.2% drain per day. On the high end that is almost 1/5 of the battery's charge. \nAnother area where LG fell short and where Samsung succeeded: release the phone very shortly after the announcement. LG loses out here.

There is nothing wrong with the G4/V10 camera, but it was not head and shoulders above the S6/Note 5 camera, let alone the S7 camera (presumably). It's possible that LG drastically improved the ISP algorithms, but it's hard to bet against a new sensor in the S7 that is designed from the ground up for faster focusing and better low light photography (one of which was already a strength in the G4/V10).", "time": "03-04-2016 03:47 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5035771", "text": "Yeah, same here.

I am starting to like this phone more and more. The S7 IP68 was really tempting, but after playing with the S7, I came to the conclusion that I am not a Samsung fan at this point. As much as people complain about the LG UI, I think Samsung's is still worse. I played with both the S7 and S7E several times and the little stutters/hesitations along with Samsung's implementation of RAM management are not to my liking. With LG, I have not noticed those strange stutters/hesitations and generally feel like the UI is more fluid. Also, Samsung is notoriously late with system updates, while at least LG seems to care in this department and supports their handsets more frequently. Finally, the replaceable battery means I can keep the phone longer if I prefer. \nLooking forward to trying out the LG G5 soon. Final thought, I hope LG is listening, please bring back the app drawer in a future update. It seems I am not alone in that thought. In the meantime if I decide to get the G5 I will use Nova Launcher.

Most people tend to believe the codec is only geared for 5.1/7.1 cinema audio. The idea behind the concept is to allow for virtual surround using the integrated technologies present in the stream (and yes that includes Stereo 2.0 Audio). Also, DD+ can be passed through a mobile stero device to an AV receiver for true 5.1 surround even if the mobile device itself cannot support multi-channel playback. This embedded technology is one way in which this surround format has the capability to enrich streaming media well beyond the typical restraints of stereo audio channels. In short, it simply enhances audio to high-fidelity audio without the high bandwidth requirements of some of the lossless formats such as FLAC.\nThere's a very good reason why we have XDA communites out there rooting their android devices just so to port over the codec from other android devices that come standard with the codec. I'm pretty sure those folks are not going through all that trouble just so to find out that the codec doesn't improve their stereo quality. \nThe AptX-HD codec does indeed require both the transmitter & receiver to have the codec installed, but that shouldn't be a reason for anyone to shy away. It's just a matter of time before a couple of high-end Bluetooth Headphones start carrying the codec. The update might be a little slower for car audio, but then again that's to be expected. Maybe if we get lucky, we might get the codec on a couple new cars like the Q60 that carries the all the new Bose Performance Series. The whole discussion about Sound Quality is entirely somewhat subjective, I have a buddy who swears behind the Burmester on his Macan, and I presonally don't agree with him. It's not a big deal, it's just a preference. We even have folks out there who would swear behind Viper 4 android, and again that's not for me, the sound doesn't seem natural, and there's a lot of tweaking involved. Before going through all that trouble, why not simply rely on a certifed industry standard for audio that's trusted by many such as DD+? \nAs for my lovely music collection, it's all an asortment of 128-320 kbps mp3s, and a few FLACs. Like most peple, I stopped carrying CDs a while ago, and it's too late to go back.

While Dolby Pro Logic or even DTS NEO can simulate surround sound from a 2 channel source, once again those are only geared up for a 5.1 or 7.1 speaker setup. They don't create the same effect for stereo headphones. For instance, 2 channel audio uploads to Youtube are up-converted to 5.1 surround using Dolby Pro Logic II, yes it's decent (if you try it with Youtube Red), but no where near the enhancement you would get from DD+ when you play the clip back on stereo headphones. Dolby Pro Logic II on stereo headphones sounds a little on the mushy clouded side, and the dynamics are a little off too.\nDD+ is more along the lines of Viper4 Android, but with a more natural immersive sound.

No more plastic phones. Get more premium. Do something, ANYTHING, with this IU. Fix this lag. Give us better battery life, but keep it removable along with additional storage.

Gone are those dull, toned down colors and sharp squared icons of the past and replaced with what I personally believe to be a super fresh look that surpasses Samsung's Touchwiz and fits right in with Google's design. The whites everywhere aren't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but it's what Google is doing. It's what Apple is doing, and this year it's a lot more of what Samsung is doing as well. And it's super lightweight compared to the G4. Regardless of where you stand on the aesthetics, this is LG again reacting to customer concerns. (Check)\nIt also comes with the usual spec bumps, primarily being the 820 that will also assist with battery management and improved overall performance. I'll give that a (Check) \nThe two biggest unknowns are battery life and camera quality. LG wants us to believe that Marshmallow, a smaller display and UI enhancements will overcome a slightly smaller battery to give us better battery life, and that the SD820's image processing will improve the quality of the camera on it's own. On paper, they should. However, plenty of on paper specs don't always work out in real world use, so we'll have to wait for the reviews. \nLG has then given us a secondary camera for wide angle shots, no attachments required. It'll have it's use cases sometimes, and other times it won't. But it's there and it's something that nobody else is giving us. And they're giving us USB-C, and speaking from personal experience (I also own a 6P), it's simply a better experience that you don't have to think about. \n(And for a bonus, and in this case I'll allow us to remember that Mod/Design for a moment... Imagine LG gave us a piece of hardware that you can connect to the bottom of the phone. It'll stick out, but not the entire frame of the device. What it does is it gives you an extra 1200m of battery, besting Samsung's top offering in the S7e. And, since there's some hardware room in there, LG added a shutter button and some other camera options you can take advantage of on the fly, cause why not.) Of course, LG's marketing this as the camera mod. I just prefer to look at it as a battery extension with some camera controls.\nSo that's the G5. In many ways, it improved it offering almost check for check with what Samsung did with the S7. Samsung has some extras LG doesn't (IP67/Wireless Charge) and LG has some extras that Samsung does't (Removable Battery/WA lens). As a phone, there's really not much the G5 does wrong. And if the story really ended there, focusing on the phone itself, I think LG would have been much better received after it's MWC showing.\nMost of the disappointing press the G5 is getting across the board is all about the \"Friends\", and gimmicky add-ons and so on. And for the most part they're right. If I trade in the G4 for the G5, it's not going to be for any of the extras that LG is banking on.

I feel the main difference between Samsung's and LG's offering this year is continuity vs. change. Samsung is clearly iterating on their previous design, making very incremental improvements and, in fact, simply adding back features that were already present in Galaxy phones of years past (removable storage, water-resistant design) but that had been removed last year. \nIf you are somewhat cynically inclined, you might argue that Samsung removed these features from the S6 last year precisely so that they would have a selling point for the S7 this year. Also note how they put a much bigger battery into the S7 edge and how they won't even offer 64GB models in prime markets in Europe and the US so as to increase their profit margins. But on the whole, their customer base will probably reward them for what they see as a 'winning formula', even if it is most certainly not a winning formula for everyone.\nLG on the other hand seems to have changed as much as they could while still checking all the design goals you listed. I believe I read somewhere that LG has two separate design teams working on their flagship phones in a 'tick-tock' fashion \u00e0 la Intel - one year team A designs the phones, and the next it's team B, with a potentially very different vision. And when you look at the G4 and the G5, you could certainly believe that that is the case. I also think that this willingness to experiment is what makes LG more interesting than other OEMs in a market filled with similar (and overpriced) offerings.\nLike others, I am very hesitant to rush to conclusions and looking forward to in-depth analysis and reviews of both Samsung's and LG's products over the next few weeks and months.", "time": "02-24-2016 04:31 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5014573", "text": "I think people are hard on the g5 because they were so genuinely excited for it.

So I am putting my own personal tastes aside here and looking at things with an open mind, trying to pick the phone that would best suit what SHE wants.\nAnd looking at these pictures and going off what I saw with the G4 and 6P... I am leaning towards getting her the S7. The G5 might have that trick wide angle camera, but when you pop over to the other 'narrow' sensor, the S7 will just do a better, more consistent job across all conditions.\nBoth do great in ideal conditions, but the smaller sensor on the G5 starts to get noisy when things start to get darker. Look at the shot with the three towers. The shadowed side of the rightmost tower, the G5 gets muddy and noisy where the S7 does a lot better in maintaining detail and much less noise. The wine corks sort of show the same behavior. The G5 has to process things a lot more to reduce the noise and you start to get that oil painting effect.\nGranted, this is exactly what is expected once I heard the G5 was going to use the same sensor that they slapped in the G4 and V10. The G5 might have more pixels, but they can't cheat physics. I just got back from vacation and took a TON of pictures with my wife's G4 and my Nexus 6P.

But as the environment got darker, so did the quality gap between the 6P's shots and the G4.\nDamn you LG!!

My first cell phone (a flip \"feature\" phone) was LG and my current phone is a G3.\nWhile I'm still immensely happy with my G3, all of the news coming out about the G5 has my intrigued. The modular nature of the phone, while seeming gimmicky, could really play into the way I use my phone.\nThat being said, I wonder how cases will work with this modular functionality. The Trident and other cases that were anounced before the phone anouncement look like typical cases that encapsulate the phone and wouldn't allow the bottom portion of the phone to be removed without taking the whole case off. This design obviously limits the utility of the phone and is the main reason why I don't switch out my current battery very often despite the phone's short battery life and having an extra on hand.\nHave there been any whispers of cases that will work with the modular functionality of the phone?", "time": "02-25-2016 12:56 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5029664", "text": "Since there's no guarantee that the modules will sell well at all, I can't imagine anyone making a case that's designed to work with the modules.

My own perspective on the modular design is that it facilitates both EXPANDABILITY and REDUCIBILTY.\nAll the people who have made their PCs could relate to it, there are components necessary for build to work and some are additions as per the need of the builder.\nExample, my pc has a geforce gpu and not a quadro cause my requirements doesnt include any professional graphic designing and chores.*\nSimilarly i can buy a barebone phone , then add buy a modular dac/amp to quench my Audiophilia. Another one of friend doesnt need that dac/amp(seriously how many can percieve difference between a FLAC or 320kbps mp3) and he wont have to pay a damn penny for what he doesnt actually need , allowing a lower retail price for the phone and allowing the maufacturer to get some extra bucks by capitalizing on the niches. It's a win win situation for both the sides.\n(Given that Lg undercuts its competetiors prices by around 100 bucks, it cant make more sense.)\nThe same goes for having physical camera buttons(perk of battery increment included) or keyboard or kitchen sink whatever modules come in the future. \nWhat about DEM BEZELS? , I beleive that symmetry is kind of under-rated and \"youraverageconsumer\" prefers a symmetrical phone over LGs established thin forehead large chin design.\nThe phone is HIDEOUS , well thats just plain subjective , i felt the same for nexus 6p but with time it starting giving them techy vibes which are irreproducible by other designs, same holds for LG G5.\nBefore it goes completely unnoticed i would like to give creds to LG for inconspicuous antenna bands giving that clean aesthetic to the phone. \nTL;DR - put down your pitchforks and torches and enjoy the time when amazing pieces of hardware like G5 and S7 were released\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "02-26-2016 01:41 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5017596", "text": "I don't think the modules are, or will be, a significant factor for this phone.

It's not a bad phone at all. I think some of the negative reaction comes from current LG device owners who see things that appear to be a step backwards: No wireless charging, smaller screen in a larger (at least taller) chassis, less battery capacity at a time competitors are giving us bigger ones, missing software features, loss of the rear buttons, and perhaps no real improvement in the camera performance.\nI'm not worried about the camera. The G4's is already very good. But I do bemoan the loss of wireless charging, the bigger bezels and smaller screen and battery compared to my G3, and the loss of the rear buttons (even though I understand why LG did it).

But before that list, it's also important to note that the vast majority of consumers will have no idea if their battery is removable or not and won't do hot swaps in their day to day lives. First, I believe devices with poor battery life shouldn't be released. If the battery life is terrible and letting you swap it out is the fix to that, that's a bad device. Second, making a battery removable means putting limitations on the size, shape and location of the battery that aren't necessary in any other circumstance. Third, making a battery removable, until this design, meant a devastating compromise to the build quality (and usually a compromise on build materials) and adds in a host of tiny, breakable plastic parts. Finally, the presence of a removable battery, for those who know it is there, promotes an unhealthy (for the device) set of battery habits that include letting batteries drain to 5% or 0% and then swapping, doing battery pulls to reset and purchasing knock-off third party batteries. \nIn the first issue, having a phone designed with better battery life is better than having to worry about battery life to the point that you feel you need two batteries. On that note I'd add that battery innovation should take place in the form of getting us batteries that last for \"weeks\" and aren't measured in 1-2 days or even hours. On the second point, it should be obvious that having a huge 3000 mAh non removable battery that is placed in a more intelligent position for heat management would be better than having a good sized 2500 mAh battery that is removable. (LG usually still goes for thicker, higher capacity devices but the point is that the size and efficiency could both be better if pulling it out of the device wasn't a consideration). This carries in to the third point, that taking that 2500 mAh battery out repeatedly is putting unneeded wear and tear on an already compromised design. And the final point - people are slowly starting to learn about battery temperature regulation and charge cycle optimization, but this is a long battle. The vast majority of people still have no idea what those things are and so real solutions to those issues need to take place on the OEM's side, not on ours. \nAll of that said, if there is going to be a removable battery, so far I like the idea presented here much more than a removable back. This appears to have less in the way of build compromises and could lead to a device that is designed much better than what the typical device with a removable back can be.", "time": "01-18-2016 07:43 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4954792", "text": "Assassin, good points but those aspects still don't outweigh a replaceable battery when needed for me.

I want to know, more importantly, approximately when will I actually be able to go to a carrier and buy one in the U.S. and around how much will it cost?\nIt's been a couple years since I bought a new phone and so I can't remember what the typical 'lag time' is between when they unveil the device as a big show to when places like AT&T, Verizon, etc actually have the device for sale. Within days? A month?\nI've seen some pretty crazy estimates on the U.S. Retail Price, like \n$900. Yes the specs are impressive, but I think that would not make the device competetive as people aren't going to spend that much on a phone even on a 30-month payment plan. Technology is suppose to get CHEAPER over time (example: cost of memory chips, SSDs, Flat-panel TVs, etc. etc.)\nMy own guesstimate is that the phone won't actually be on sale at the carrier until around a month after the unveiling -- although I would think in order to capitalize on the \"buzz\" from the initial announcement it would be in their best interest to have the phone in carrier stores within a week? Or is it more important to get the announcement out period?\nAs far as price my guts says all manufacturers are going to not price above an iPhone 6 or 6s. A full price 64GB iPhone 6s at AT&T is $750 right now so I would say the G5 will not be more than that. The G4 is currently $463 at AT&T or basically $263 if you get it at Best Buy with the $200 gift card you get when you buy it. Obviously AT&T/Best Buy are trying to reduce G4 inventory in prep for the G5 release. The G5 has better specs (of course) then the G4, but from a practicaly standpoint, is it worth three times the price? I think not. \nMy guess is the new G5 from a carrier will be $699 - or $$23.30/month + taxes for a 32GB version.

[{"title": "LG G5 Expectations", "thread": [{"postID": "post4990878", "text": "So we've got a bit more info about the upcoming LG G5, which will be unveiled on February 21st alongside the GS7 at MWC. Let me list down my expectations as the owner of a G4.\nIn terms of design, I would really like them to step it up. The G4 didn't feel terrible per se, but it definitely felt cheaper compared to its rivals. I personally didn't mind it (partly because mine has a leather back), but when rivals are going towards more 'premium' materials, LG has to jump on the bandwagon to stay relevant in the minds of the average consumer. \nFor hardware, I expect nothing but top-end hardware for the G5. So a Snapdragon 820 processor with no-less than 3GB of LPDDR4 memory, though 4GB would be nice. 32GB should be base though 64GB would be splendid and also retain the option for expandable storage. Removable battery is not likely due to the redesign, but if LG can pull it off with that modular slot, I'll be impressed. Said battery should also be reasonably large, as-in, over 3000mAh in size. Expect a fingerprint sensor and other goodies as well.\nIn terms of display, given LG's recent teaser of an always-on display, I'm expecting a QHD OLED display. It's unlikely that LG will use an IPS panel because for an always-on display, IPS panels aren't efficient in terms of power-consumption because the entire backlight needs to be on while for an OLED display, only the necessary pixels are lit up. \nFor the camera, I don't expect many changes, though a smaller aperture, fine-tuning of the software and even a dual-lens setup are on my list. Should still be a 16MP sensor with 3-axis OIS and manual controls.\nLast but not least is software. I want LG to rethink their UI design. I mean, LG UX isn't a bad performer. It just doesn't look very good. Main thing I want them to address is the DPI of the UI. It's just too damn high, which makes everything look too damn big. Lower it down to a more manageable DPI so that more things can fit on-screen.\nAnd here's a bonus. Better quality control. I owned a G4 that fell victim to the bootloop issue that's affecting quite a lot of G4s out there. I want them to sort their quality-control out with the G5 because their current QC is making me weary already.\nAnd those are pretty much my expectations.

That all said, the deal breaker for me would be a 5.9\" screen. I nearly got a G4 because it is about the maximum size to use a phone comfortably. Don't get me wrong, the trend of 5.7\" has its place, but you'll see on the Nexus 6p forums that many people would take the 6p phone specs and put it in the 5x if they could, myself included.
