For each piece, there's a link left in internal storage, so if the pieces aren't a lot smaller than the links, you aren't saving anything.\nBut if the card is formatted as internal storage, you have no choice where apps go - all of storage, the eMMC in the phone and the SD on the card, are one big block of storage, and Android decides which goes where.\nDid you do wrong? I think so. If the phone doesn't have enough internal storage for all your apps, you need a phone with more internal storage, or fewer apps. SD cards have a limited number of write cycles, and an app moved to the SD card may write to where it's stored.
