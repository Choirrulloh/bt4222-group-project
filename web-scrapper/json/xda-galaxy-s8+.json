After a few hours of uptime it will start to stutter when typing fast or switching between apps.\r\n2. The over the top animations get annoying, but if you turn them off it feels weed and even slower.\r\n3. Battery life seems good when watching videos that are supported by the hardware decoder but most hdr stuff is not no I could not even watch The Revenant on one charge and during that the device got very warm and I encountered a few dropped frames.\r\n4.

Obviously, your experiences may vary but based on my user habits, and I run the hell outta my daily driver, it's been performing brilliantly with no issues.  BixBye let's me remap that idiotic button without root so I'm good on that end which was the only real reason I was even contemplated rooting when it  became available for this version.\n\r\nI truly believe at this stage in Android and Samsung's combined software and hardware development on the S8+ things have finally matured enough where I'm not feeling that burning desire to root.

This can vary depending on the app, and if it's still in memory and whatnot, but it's pretty consistent and pronounced.\n\nI've also experienced the lag and input delay with the keyboard randomly and seemingly without any obvious reason. Sometimes it's after heavy use, sometimes it's after just a few minutes of use.\n\nIn some cases and at certain times, I've actually found budget phones like the Moto G5 Plus to run faster and more reliably than the S8+, which is pretty ridiculous when you think about the difference in price points.\n\nWith Samsungs, it just seems like absolutely everything is great on the hardware side, but the software is just an utter mess - it's like nothing is optimized, no thought is giving to long-term sustainability, and the minute the phone is out of the box, the software experience starts to deteriorate rapidly.
