I was really just too curious. I haven't installed anything or signed into any accounts...so it's really just the basic interface set up right now. I'm only able to compare it to my LG G3, which is a 2.5 year old device. Based on that, though, I'm already impressed. I don't know what an S7 or a OnePlus 3 or a V20 (or even a V10) is like...so my perspective may be a little out of whack in comparison to someone who handles a lot of flagship devices regularly. \nMy comparison between the Le Pro 3 and the G3:\nFingerprint: well, this is my first time experiencing a fingerprint reader on a phone, but it seems quick and responsive. Easy to set up.\nHaptic feedback: much stronger on the Pro 3\nSound: FAR better on the Pro 3. The G3 sound was always very disappointing, so the bar was set pretty low. I must say I hate all the ringtone options...but that's all subjective.\nInterface: the lack of usable features on the notification shade is annoying and frankly confusing. I'm hoping they change this part of the eui interface...or at least allow as an option (much like EMUI has done with the app drawer with their recent v5 update).\nScreen: One advantage - on paper - my G3 has is the quad HD resolution vs. the Pro 3 HD resolution. Once I had them side by side, the difference was almost inconsequential. I didn't run a bunch of comparisons, but my initial impression was they are about equal. \nCamera: My G3 camera has always driven me a bit nutty. I do love the G3 camera app that allows you to take a photo by touching anywhere on the display, but the shutter speed was always...very...very...slow. On my half dozen test shots on the Pro3, the shutter was nice and quick and the shots appeared to be of decent quality. \nI'll have to run a couple actual tests on this device over the next week or two...just to see if I'm really okay with using this device for the next year or so.

We'd been planning to move over from Sprint for the longest time, we were just waiting for an opportunity when one or both of us really needed to upgrade. Well, the LG G3 I'd been using started giving me real trouble. This was the second replacement for that phone - the first one bricked after just a few weeks, the second one after a little over a year. This time, the screen just started doing weird stuff - freezing up, fading out, flickering. Made it unusable...so we went over to T-Mobile last night and signed up.\nThe Pro 3 is a nice, solid device. Easy to set up, fast and responsive. The interface takes some getting used to, but it's not quite as annoying as I thought it would be. Slowly having to get rid of my LG muscle memory (I miss knock-on!), but I'm already getting the hang of it. The one thing I've noticed is the fingerprint reader is not as dependable as I'd hoped. I've figured out how to touch it to get it to wake faster, but I'd say it's probably somewhere between 50 and 75% success at first touch. \nAnother thing that took me a while to figure out was why my screen seemed so much bigger. The G3 was also 5.5\" (although it was a quad-HD display, this one seems just as crisp as that one did). No...I finally realized the difference: capacitive buttons. I'd gotten so used to the on-screen buttons, I never really thought about how much real estate they took up on the screen. It feels like I have much more room on this one, amazingly enough. \nI'm not a big 'music on my phone' kind of guy, so I haven't messed with the earphones or the audio, but what I've heard just messing with the notifications and ringtones, the audio on this is decent. Surely not among the top performers, but clearly better than my G3.\nWhile I tend to keep my phones in the 2 to 3 year range, I suspect this one will not be a long-term device for my 'daily driver'. It's good, not outstanding. I'm hoping to see some software and UI upgrades this year, hopefully closer to stock android as rumored. I have heard the camera is disappointing...but I haven't taken many photos yet, so we'll see. I think it's enough to keep me happy at least through this year...long enough until I can have a choice for a higher-end device with better camera and fingerprint sensor...maybe water-proof/resistant.

I'm sure I'll be back if anything comes up that I want to complain about (or praise, of course).", "time": "02-03-2017 02:30 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5689384", "text": "Okay...so after a few weeks of having this as my regular phone, I have the same concerns.\nThe camera just generally is not great. It's not awful, really...it just doesn't stand out. It's quicker than my G3 was, but the image quality is lacking and the audio quality on videos is not great.\nThe fingerprint sensor is still inconsistent.\nThe vibration is very weak. I'm constantly missing notifications and even calls because I don't feel the vibration in my pocket. My G3 also was pretty weak in this regard, but the Pro 3 is much worse.\nStill gotta complain about the lack of good quality protective cases. I ended up with a Nillkin textured thin case, but it's not anything close to a Spigen or Otterbox level of protection. This one is primarily for grip and to cover the gold color which I've never been wild about.\nOverall, I'd say this phone is good enough to keep me happy through the year. It's nice to have a low cost device that handles well and does most everything I need well enough.

Weird thing happened the other day. I don't usually do music on my phones, but the other day I fired up Pandora and plugged in the headphones that came with the phone. About 20 minutes in, the phone totally flipped out. The screen went blank and the sound no longer came through the headphones, instead blaring out the main speakers.

It was shipped quick and packaged like a premium handset. Having no experience with the brand, I\u2019m downright impressed with the quality and performance of this budget handset. I have no doubt that this device will set the bar to which all sub $200 phones are judged. It performs as well as phones that were twice the price.The Good:\nAll day battery + Quick Charge\nButtery smooth performance\nMore than good camera\nDeceivingly light The Bad:\nLeEco take on Android is a challenge\nThe screen should be brighter\nIt\u2019s pretty chunkyMy Usage:\nI\u2019ve been using the LeEco Le S3 for three days as my daily driver on AT&T in the Twin Cities. It shipped with the up-to-date software version (As of 11/7/16).Hardware:\nIt\u2019s another metal phone. It\u2019s a pretty close ringer to the HTC M9 and OnePlus 3 designs. It has the square camera with the fingerprint sensor right below it. What you notice right away when you take this phone out of the box is that it is stout. I went from the OnePlus 3 to the Le S3 and it was a dramatic change. Though the overall footprint isn\u2019t changed too much, the phone doesn\u2019t taper nearly as thin. The edges are a noticeable. It\u2019s a bigger phone, but it is a lighter phone as well. If you like a phone that you notice in your hand and if you feel safe having some sort of edge to hold on to, I think you\u2019ll like the feel of this device.\nI can also tell the speakers on the bottom of this phone are made for media. They\u2019re about as loud as any speakers I\u2019ve heard on a phone (including the HTC One line). They seem to be well balanced and offer as much bass as you could ask for from speakers on a device this small. I have caught myself a couple of times turning the volume down when I\u2019m watching snap stories alone, and hardly having to turn it up in a room full of people. If you could complain about phone speakers being too loud, this would be your best case.\nHow they finished the metal casing has played a little trick on my senses. It\u2019s definitely a metal phone, but my sense of touch would have me guess that it\u2019s plastic. I don\u2019t know if that speaks more to the finish of the phone or how far plastic phones have come, but it doesn\u2019t scream metal phone when you\u2019re touching it.\nFeel aside, the phone looks to be assembled well.

The nice thing is that the display brightness is one setting that\u2019s easily adjusted (more on that to come), but in my use, this screen is just bright enough to use and won\u2019t be blowing anyone away.\nThat being said, the colors are fine. It\u2019s an okay screen, and it isn\u2019t too damaging to the battery to have the brightness at levels that allow you to see what\u2019s on the screen. There are some preset calibrations that allow you to cater the display to how you feel best. That helps offset an otherwise dull display\n.\nMy complaints could just be what I\u2019m used to, but I would have liked to see a little brighter display on a phone touting a great entertainment ecosystem.Courage:\nLeEcho dropped the headphone jack from these phones. I was hardly bummed. The writing has been on the walls and in other devices already. They are kind enough to supply USB C headphones in the box. And a dongle. The headphones are white and decent enough to remind me of another company\u2019s included, white headphones. The headphones are surprisingly balanced and round for something you get free. You\u2019ll also find the much loathed dongle for adapting stereo mini plugs to USB-C.\nWhat you will find when you search your phone over for a headphone jack is an IR blaster. I looked all over the Specs and didn\u2019t once see that mentioned. There is a remote app included in the software as well. It seems to work like any of the other remote apps I\u2019ve used. It was an appreciated surprise for such a cheap phone. (I am not a fan of calling this phone cheap. It\u2019s inexpensive, but well done. You get what I\u2019m saying, though.)\nOther things that are included in the box are the charger, which happens to be a quick charger, a screen protector that\u2019s pre-applied, and a good enough clear, soft plastic case. It\u2019s nice to have, especially considering there doesn\u2019t seem to be many accessories available in the states yet.Specs:\nDISPLAY\n5.5\u201d Full HD (1080p)\n403ppi Resolution\nCorning\u00ae Gorilla\u00ae Glass 3\nPERFORMANCE\nQualcomm\u00ae Snapdragon\u2122 652 CPU\n32GB Storage\n3GB RAM\n3000mAh Battery\nUnlocked Dual-SIM\nCAMERA\n16MP Rear Camera\n8MP Front Camera\n4K Video Recording\nDual-LED Rear Flash\nSlow-Motion Recording\nPanorama Mode", "time": "11-08-2016 05:02 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5553629", "text": "Software:\nIt\u2019s safe to say that the software is my least favorite part of this phone. Let\u2019s dive in.\nFirst, the launcher. They\u2019ve done away with the app drawer. To some, that\u2019s a huge no-no. I didn\u2019t mind the implementation on the Nextbit Robin. There\u2019s something about the lack of an app drawer on this device that really grinds my gears. To the left of the default is the LeEco landing page. It\u2019s a nice way to consume what LeEco has to offer. I haven\u2019t been able to use it enough to have a decided opinion on it, but it seems decent.\nAnother software quirk is the notification drawer and quick settings. In most (if not all) the android phones I\u2019ve used in the last two or three years, if you need a setting you can quickly get to it from the notification drawer, either in the quick settings or in the full settings that\u2019s available when you pull open the notifications. This is gone with LeEco\u2019s EUI. That space is reserved for 100% notifications 100% of the time.\nInstead, if you want quick settings, you have to go into the multitasking pane. Multitasking mode is half totally useful and half a total mess. When you go into multitasking pane, you will immediately be hit with a quick launcher for tools, media controller, quick settings bar, screen brightness slider, open apps, and a RAM cleaner button. It\u2019d all be useful stuff if it didn\u2019t slam across your screen all at once when you press the recent apps button.\nAnd the quickest way to get into settings is in the multitasking pane on a top slider. It's fine. It actually didn't work for me right away and instead brought up the slider settings. Now it's working and much less annoying than it was before.\nI also think they got the back and multitasking buttons switched around. I know that\u2019s been an issue on phones in the past. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s supposed to be, but it feels backwards. I\u2019ll adjust soon enough.\nThe launcher is something you can replace, but that shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility as the consumer, and when you do replace it, you still don\u2019t get an easy way to settings unless you have the app on your home screen.Camera:\nThe camera app isn\u2019t as full featured as I\u2019ve been used to. There aren\u2019t manual controls, there is an HDR mode, and there is a setting for a LeEco watermark. The camera takes good pictures. In HDR it improves the blowouts a little, but it does take a relative eternity to save the shot. This won\u2019t be a Google Pixel or iPhone 7 camera, but it gets the job done, and it does well considering it\u2019s not (as far as I can tell) doing any sort of HDR magic. \nPictures in the daylight are darn good. Even in average lighting, there\u2019s enough information to at least Snapseed my way into a great picture. Night shots are a little harder. It gives you a reminder that you need to keep your phone still when it\u2019s taking a night photo, but it still ends up with some noise. I\u2019ve had some surprisingly good photos and some surprisingly bad pictures at night. There\u2019s potential there, but no consistency. It will be interesting to see if that gets fixed by an update eventually. I\u2019ve taken some surprisingly nice night shots.", "time": "11-08-2016 05:04 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5554725", "text": "Also, there is an HDR mode, but it's very slow.

On paper, I\u2019m halving my RAM, halving my storage, and I\u2019m using a slower processor to power the same number of pixels. I was expecting lag, bottlenecks, and heat, as well as a decreased battery life due to the screen decisions each company made.\nInstead, I have a phone that is, by all practical measures, just as enjoyable to use. I have yet to find myself in a situation where I feel the processor and RAM get choked up. The UI is smooth, even with the (in my mind, necessary) 3rd party launchers installed. I get insane battery life. Between the battery life and the quick charge, today is the first day I\u2019ve felt like I needed to plug it in outside of my daily commute and errands (I had a phone interview and had to make sure it was prepared). The phone is efficient enough and charges fast enough that I don\u2019t worry about finding an outlet overnight. \nThe camera is fine passable. I\u2019ve rarely found myself upset with any of the shots, but I haven\u2019t found myself overly impressed either, except for that random night shot that TOTALLY turns out.\nThe screen is the only hardware piece of this phone that I have a complaint about. In direct sunlight it\u2019s a challenge to see. The colors are okay, and nothing really pops like it did on the OnePlus 3, or other screens on phones 2-4 times its cost. I think it\u2019s an okay compromise, though I\u2019m puzzled by it when LeEco is trying desperately to sell its media platform to the US.\nAnd the software. Oh, this software. I installed a launcher after I decided the software wasn\u2019t worth dealing with. I was able to make settings a bit more accessible with Microsoft\u2019s Arrow launcher. I\u2019ll gripe about the functionality of it all day, but it\u2019s fast and responsive, and for a budget cell phone, that\u2019s more than I can ask for.Should you buy it?\nYeah, I would give this phone two thumbs way up. The performance to cost simply can\u2019t be beat. The build is great, and at $150, it\u2019s perfectly suited to be the best backup, or a cheap daily driver. I\u2019m selling my OnePlus (because it\u2019s worth what I put into it) right now and I\u2019m going to rock the LeEco for a while and my daily driver. The value offered here is second to none and from a practical standpoint, I don\u2019t understand why you would pay double for a phone that\u2019s equally as nice. Just make sure you buy it with the credits at LeMall.com. It\u2019s a fine phone at $250 as well, but if you can get it for $150, why wouldn\u2019t you?", "time": "11-08-2016 05:05 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5554649", "text": "Can I ask how much screen on time are you getting?

Really?\nOr a budget phone, for $130, that would blast ANY phone at that price point out of the water. I mean I've picked up LG20s, S7s, and even a Pixel, to me this phone would compare in the visual and premium feel department. This phone FEELS like 600 bucks and costs $130.
