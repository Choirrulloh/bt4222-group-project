My carrier is **AT&amp;T**, and I suppose my price range is anywhere really, but I prefer as inexpensive as possible (I'm just looking for the **best bang for my buck**).\n\nFor screen size, 5-5.5 inches is the sweet spot for me, but I'm open to trying other phone form-factors. My backup phone was pretty tall with a 5 inch screen which I liked as well (BLU R1 HD).\n\nI'll be using my phone primarily for long video streaming and some light gaming here and there (mostly for my weeb gatcha games), but it'd be nice to have a **good** **processor**, as the most intensive thing I'll probably be using is Snapchat funnily enough. I'm used to the processing power of the LG G4, so something above that level would be nice. \n\nBy far however, the most important thing to me would be a **good camera** paired with a **good battery**. Again, the LG G4 was my benchmark as the camera on that phone was amazing, but the battery for my use was abysmal (heck, I'd be glad to have another G4 if LG as a company didn't spite me with the bootloop, battery, and overheating issues).\n\nIf anything's extra really, I'd like to have **NFC** on mine for Android Pay and relatively decent storage space (anything higher than 16 GB, that's killed my current backup phone), if not, then **MicroSD** compatibility. A fingerprint reader would be AWESOME (but probably unrealistic for my price point). If the phone were to get pricey if anything, I'd really like for it to be IP68 waterproof because I tend to be around pools a lot when on vacation. Other than that, USB Type C would be awesome.\n\nThanks everyone!\n\ntl;dr version is in bold.

The Pixel 2 seems like a decent device, though the headphone jack is a deal breaker along with no support with video out through usb-c (to my knowledge). This is also why I still use a iPhone 6s and am not too pleased to go towards newer Apple handsets. Had iPhone since 2015 and finding an Android that is supported for 3-4 years, even just security, seems to limit the scope... especially when many companies aren\u2019t automatically fully supporting treble. \n\nI\u2019ve tried the g6  and V30 and actually liked both, but after research seems LG is notorious for bad software support... also had two LG handsets previously that just plain malfunctioned without reason (Nexus 4 and G3). Is Samsung the only other major flagship to include preferable features with decent support? If so is it easy enough to do things such as remap the bixby button, remove their stock Samsung apps, and do a full appearance mod? \n\nIf there are any other companies worth taking a look at I\u2019d love to know. Price is a concern but LTS and quality is more important. \n\n", "created": 1520790405.0, "replies": [{"text": "Get a used pixel device, first generation.

Qi / wireless charging\n2. Stock(ish) android\n3. Regular updates\n4. Good custom rom support\n5. Headphone jack\n6. USB-C\n7. New (as in \"with warrenty\")\n\nI would prefer an Android one device for (2), (3) and maybe (4).\nProject Treble will hopefully be helpful too for (3) and (4).\nBut both aren't mandatory if the devices satisfies (2), (3) and (4) either way.\n(4) is not important now but once (3) runs out I would go custom rom (as with my Nexus 5).\n\nCriteria (1) seems to be most problematic.\nThere are not many phones out there support Qi / wireless charging.\nMany vendors don't even have devices supporting it (like HTC, Huawei / Honor, OnePlus, ZTE).
