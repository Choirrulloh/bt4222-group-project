It's definitely time for an upgrade as the camera, battery and all those things are nearing its end. For a new phone, I'm happy to spend some money but don't thing a new S9 is a smart decision ($$$) - perhaps there is a better option for me. Out of the S6, S7, S8, was there one that was rated higher, or ones I should avoid? A good camera is important. I don't watch movies or play games. I don't like larger phones (like XL models, etc)\n\nI have been eyeing off the Pixel 2 but am really on the edge when it comes to the absence of headphone jack (I am listening to music/podcasts daily). I am happy to look at another Android phone outside of the Galaxy range, but am unsure where else to start.\n\nSo since I've been looking at the Pixel 2, my budget is about $800AUD\n\n\nFurther details:\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nCarrier: Unlocked\n\nPrice: ~$800AUD\n\nSize Preference: I don't like larger phones, so just normal size is what I'm after.\n\nWhat will it be used for: Podcasts, video/camera is important.\n\nPreferred brands: At this point I'm looking at Samsung and Google Pixel, but open to something else\n\nOther: 64gb is sufficient (if I can expand via micro SD then that's great).", "created": 1521418172.0, "replies": [{"text": "The S8 sounds like a great fit for you.

This would be worth doing if I can get something that will be an upgrade from my current phone, and last me 2 or 3 years until I need to upgrade again.\n\n**Country**: UK\n\n**Carrier**: Ideally I would like to stay on a rolling contract with Giffgaff as it is reasonably priced, and I like the option of being able to change the contract at any time, or to cancel it if I will be abroad for an extended amount of time e.g. travelling for a number of months.\n\n**Price**: Off contract. Ideally I would like to pay around \u00a3300. But it looks like a lot of phones are more expensive than that so I could stretch to up to \u00a3450.\n\nSize Preference: My current OP3 has a 5.5 inch screen and I would not want a screen smaller than this. Open to any screen size bigger or equal to 5.5 inch.\n\n**What will it be used for**:\n\n* Occasionally watching films.\n* No gaming.\n* I would like the option to be able to torrent but unlikely it will be used for this very often if at all.\n* Streaming Google Play Music.\n\n**Preferred brands**: The hassle of getting my OP3 screen fixed is pretty annoying. It would be great if I could pop down to a local shop and get it fixed. Local shops I have asked about fixing this want \u00a3200 to fix it, which is more than the phone is worth second hand. OP3 will fix for \u00a3100 but I would have to send to Poland and I'm guessing it could take weeks to get back to me.\nI'm guessing a more common or 'main stream' phone would be easier/cheaper to fix? If so, this would be a bonus\n\n**Other**: \n\n* Physical navigation buttons preferred (menu and back buttons). I don't want to have to take up part of my screen to have back button and menu button.\n* Headphone jack essential.\n* Fingerprint unlocking essential.\n* Notification light light essential.\n* 64gb storage bare minimum. More would be preferred.\n* Waterproofing would be great to have so that it can be used on a motorcycle.\n* Fast charging would be great. OP3 dash charge is fantastic.\n* Not hugely bothered about android version but I would like to avoid bloatware wherever possible. Definitely no facebook app.\n* I might root it, my current OP is rooted but I don't really use many rooted features.\n\n**Summary:\nMid range phone with 5.5 + inch screen. Fingerprint unlocking essential. Waterproofing preferred. Headphone jack essential. \u00a3250-450 price range.**", "created": 1521394073.0, "replies": [{"text": "Well, the S8 has been slashed a bit.

I'd personally pick that one, because the size is good (5,7\"), it has fast charging, a good display and a huge battery. \n\nNokia 7 Plus is too expansive (\u20ac399) when you can get a Xiaomi for much less money (\u20ac225). I think if you need one now which comes closest to the OnePlus, I'd get the Xiaomi Mi One.

My backup phone was pretty tall with a 5 inch screen which I liked as well (BLU R1 HD).\n\nI'll be using my phone primarily for long video streaming and some light gaming here and there (mostly for my weeb gatcha games), but it'd be nice to have a **good** **processor**, as the most intensive thing I'll probably be using is Snapchat funnily enough. I'm used to the processing power of the LG G4, so something above that level would be nice. \n\nBy far however, the most important thing to me would be a **good camera** paired with a **good battery**. Again, the LG G4 was my benchmark as the camera on that phone was amazing, but the battery for my use was abysmal (heck, I'd be glad to have another G4 if LG as a company didn't spite me with the bootloop, battery, and overheating issues).\n\nIf anything's extra really, I'd like to have **NFC** on mine for Android Pay and relatively decent storage space (anything higher than 16 GB, that's killed my current backup phone), if not, then **MicroSD** compatibility. A fingerprint reader would be AWESOME (but probably unrealistic for my price point). If the phone were to get pricey if anything, I'd really like for it to be IP68 waterproof because I tend to be around pools a lot when on vacation.

Don't want a super huge phone because my hands are small enough as is, the 5x was just about perfect pretty much.\n\nWhat Will It Be Used For: Texting and taking pictures/video. Preferably I want it to just be quick. I don't want to play games or watch tv on it. Large storage, good-great cam, quick processor with decent ram. Currently own a 5X that's been going strong for 3+ years so I'm hoping to find something that can beat it. Only reason I am looking for a new phone is due to the 5x really being pretty slow at this point and consistently being out of storage.\n\nPreferred Brands: HTC/Nexus. No samsung, no apple. Open to less known brands as long as the reviews prove it to be reliable. Only reason I would like a brand phone like the Nexus again is because it's pretty easy to find cases for it and most apps don't have odd errors. It was at purchase just a pretty damn solid phone.

NFC kinda needs to be there, it's just too convenient to pass up. I don't know if old versions of android, or just different phones, will have an issue with my smart watch but in that case it should be compatible with an asus android watch. I lesser important feature is fingerprint unlocking, but I am a sucker for it so plus points for that I suppose but I can live without it.\n\nAdditionally, if anyone thinks I should just hold off and let the 5X truly reach the point where it dies because nothing in the 200-300 range will REALLY blow it out the water atm then I'm welcome to that opinion as well.

It is along the same lines of the LG K20 Plus however the screen is a little bit smaller at 5 in instead of 5.3 in, it only has 16 GB of internal storage versus the 32GB in the K20 Plus. But it has some sort of Splash Resistance where the K20 plus isn't certified for any type of water resistance. But being that it has not been sold through T-Mobile you would probably have to find an unlocked MetroPCS model which would work just fine on T-Mobile as long as it is unlocked.\n\nI've heard good things about the zMAX Pro which is also a higher-end entry level phone with a 6-inch screen. I think it has a Snapdragon 617 processor in it so it won't be as fast or as battery-saving as the Snapdragon 625 but it should be pretty good in performance versus anything with a Snapdragon 417/425 /435 processor. There aren't any Mint Condition ones available on swappa right now but a good condition one is under $100.\nhttps://swappa.com/buy/zte-zmax-pro-tmobile\n\nYou also have the option of going with something that is 1 year older like the LG G5 that you can find for right around $100 on swappa. The performance will be significantly better on those however I've heard of a couple small bugs here and there, I've heard there are Bluetooth bugs and GPS bugs.

My Mom's Huawei is 6.1 inches and while huge, I love it.\n\n- 32 GB storage. Or 16 GB if it can take an SD card for expansion.*\n\n- $125-$199. I know, we are cheapos. I am hoping to find something decent at this price range. I'm OK with refurbished.\n\n- Android. I think this is obvious, but I'll say it.\n\nMy mom uses a [Huawei MT2L03](https://www.walmart.com/ip/HUAWEI-Ascend-Mate-2-MT2-L03-16GB-Unlocked-GSM-4G-LTE-Android-Phone-Black/42287058). I am tempted just to get that, but am wondering if anyone knows of something a little more recent/powerful/better that would be in our price range.\n\nThank you and if you don't mind, get off my lawn!

Here are the global criterias I'm looking for in order of importance:\n\n* Vanilla Android system on latest version, with Android updates coming ASAP (this was the thing I loved the most on the Nexus line). I just discovered that Google is ending the major OS support for Nexus phones so a Nexus 5X isn't a good option.\n* Great components, able to last several years without any problem. In the big lines, I'd like good cameras, both back and front; a good battery and 32GB of storage at least (MicroSD card slot is a plus but totally optional). Bonus points if it has at least 3GB of RAM and a nice CPU, but if the price isn't too high.\n* A 3.5mm jack. This sounds dumb but it's really important.\n* SIM-unlocked and works with Europe data carriers.\n* I'm not really aware of how did the prices evolve since I've stopped following the Android smartphones evolution a few years ago, but is \u20ac300-\u20ac400 a reasonable price range? Don't hesitate to link phones outside this price range though, I'm definitely not against the idea of putting more money to get what would really fit me.\n* NFC.\n* Everything else is optional. I don't care about fingerprint, USB-C or not, Bluetooth version, screen size (I prefer 5\" but I don't really care), weight, etc. Hell even weird button placements wouldn't be a problem, it's just a matter of getting used to it.\n\nThe main usages will be (in order) music, photography, application development and gaming.\n\nAfter doing some research I found the Pixel to be quite what I was looking for, but it's expensive as hell.

When I bought the phone, I unlocked the bootloader and flashed Lineage 15.  The first two months I've had the device I was with AT&amp;T and got full LTE.  In early February, I switched to Verizon, and now I can't get LTE data or advanced calling (simultaneous voice and data).  Apparently this is a known issue when flashing an Oreo ROM with this device, and there's no fix at present - even going so far as to relock the bootloader and flash back to stock doesn't fix this issue.\n\nSo it looks like I'm going to have to get another phone, because 3G only is driving me nuts.  I'd stick with the G5+, but the slow pace of official updates and Motorola's poor device support track record make me think twice about getting one and sticking to stock.  So I'm in need of some advice on what to get next.\n\nAs far as needs/wants:\n\n * I mostly do web browsing, email, Facebook, and Twitter on this thing, as well as occasionally watching videos on YouTube or Netflix/Amazon/Hulu.\n * My price point tops out around $550.\n * An unlockable bootloader is a must.\n * Stock Android is HIGHLY preferred (or if the device has a 98% functional custom ROM, that's fine too).\n * I also want to stick with a vendor that's on top(ish) of security updates and version upgrades.\n * An all day battery is also a must.  My SOT averages 4-6 hours a day.\n * 4GB of RAM and 32GB storage (or more) preferred.  An SD card is preferred, but by no means necessary.\n * Headphone jack is preferred, but also not a must.\n * Same size screen as the G5+ would be nice, so 5ish inches.\n * A fingerprint reader that supports gestures would also be a plus.\n\nIn terms of my shortlist as it is, here's what I've got:\n\n *  HTC U11: I've always had a soft spot in my heart for these guys since my first phone was theirs (an Aria).  That being said, this is above my price point, and the phone doesn't terribly excite me, but maybe there's someone here who can confirm my bias towards this phone.\n * OG Pixel: Got a buddy who loves his, and it checks most of my boxes.  I'm thinking this is my best option, but I can't shake the feeling that this phone isn't for me.\n * Essential PH-1: I love the look of the device and the company ethos, but I've heard that this thing has had SO many issues.  I hesitate to pull the trigger since I know it's had so many problems.  If there are any current users lingering about, I'd like to hear how the phone is doing today.\n\nOf course, I'm also open to any other suggestions.\n\nTIA!\n\nEdit: formatting", "created": 1522178647.0, "replies": [{"text": "one plus five or moto z2 force (only $375 at t-mobile and you can get the free Alexa moto mod too).

The thing is without a big resale value on the OP3 (I'll repair it and sell it but not much gain there probably), it is even more the case.\n\nFrom the OP3, I loved the snappy performance (including the crazy fast fingerprint reader compared to my previous iPhone 6), great screen (even if only 1080p but seriously don't think I need more), quick charge (that is so good but I guess it's not required if the phone has a good battery for the entire day). I mainly do a lot of web/Reddit browsing, texting and Youtube viewing on my phone. Also use it as a main camera but I don't take that many photos and don't need the absolute best there (which is on phones which are much too expensive for what I'm willing to make).\n\nAn ideal candidate would be the OP5T but it remains quite expensive overall : 560\u20ac for the 128 GB version which seems to be the only one still in stock.

I detailed my habits above and while it is pretty \"intensive browsing\" (I open a lot of apps/tabs and co and like keeping them open and ready to switch often), it is still browsing. How would a 200\u20ac phone (like the Xiaomi Mi A1 that is on my short list or something like the Moto G) would handle that on the day to day (I hate lag and often loading apps really) ? Would it be able to last for 2 years like I usually do ?

If the phone is already unlocked you should be all set to go, but if it's locked you can usually take it to the original carrier and as long as the phone has been paid in full they'll almost always unlock it.\n\n* **If meeting in person, meet in a safe place**.

Below is additional information:\n\n    Carrier: AT&amp;T\n\n    Price: $300, off contract\n\n    Size Preference: No preference\n\n    What will it be used for: Productivity, streaming (primarily music), multitasking, drawing if screen is sizeable enough to warrant a stylus\n\n    Preferred brands: No preference, although I do enjoy ASUS/HTC/Samsung products\n\n    Other: Battery is THE biggest factor for me. Drawing (pressure-sensitivity) a huge plus, snappiness/multitasking stress capabilities.\n\nThanks!\n", "created": 1521953490.0, "replies": [{"text": "used Note 5?, get the unlocked version, it oscillates around 300 in swappa", "created": 1521980020.0, "replies": [{"text": "My wife had one and the battery life wasn't that great with how old it was.

Because of that, my first recommendation is the Essential Phone. Some T-Mobile customers reported cell reception issues, and that's something I personally encountered in my time with it, so keep that in mind.\n\nMy second suggestion is the Moto X4.

I know it's received plenty of flak, but the $375 price from T-Mobile makes it a very solid buy. You can buy it outright and unlock it at some point, so you should be okay on that front.\n\nI will warn that Lenovo/Motorola have a spotty track record on updates, but they still arrive. Eventually.

If your looking for a phone to use for a long time, I would choose the Moto X4, over the Huawei phones. If updates don't matter to you as much, the Huawei's will do just fine. Also IMO, the X4 has a bit nicer build quality than the Huawei.\n\nIn order to get the Moto X4 Android One edition, you have to buy it from Google's Project Fi, which is a no contract carrier. In order to receive the discount, you will have to activate it on the Project Fi Network. If you dont, Google will charge you the the extra amount to make up for the discount.

My experience comes from switching to Android from an iPhone SE.\n\nTHE GOOD: Lots. I bought it used from B&amp;H Photo (grade 9 condition) for $159, no tax. The battery life is quite frankly amazing for a phone with a 1080p 5.5\" IPS screen. I can get a full day out of it easily with around 15-20% left at the end of the day. It also has a fingerprint reader AND NFC - usually you can find only one of those features but not both on a phone under $200. Build quality is near-flagship level. Software is pure Android with zero bloatware, and I just got the Android 8.0 Oreo upgrade (and HMD Global has committed to bringing Android P to it as well). \n\nThe screen isn't 18:9, but I don't even care.\n\nFinally, it has the necessary bands for T-Mobile (2, 4, and 12) and fully supports Wi-Fi calling. I'm using MintSim on it right now, but I will probably switch to MetroPCS at the end of this month because MintSim doesn't support Wi-Fi calling or Visual Voicemail on the Nokia 6. Numerous people have confirmed that those features do work on MetroPCS though.\n\nTHE BAD: Camera isn't great but gets the job done. Images are just average, and shutter speed is slow. If you're only a casual photo taker like me then it should suffice. \n\nThe Snapdragon 430 keeps things running smoothly for the most part, but lag is present every so often. To negate this, I turned on Developer Options and changed the setting for \"Background process limit\" to \"At most 4 processes.\" This will yield noticeable performance gains without you having to do anything else, but I also installed the Datally app to kill apps from sipping data in the background and SD Maid to regularly clear up any junk files. Now it's like butter.\n\nFingerprint reader is on the front of the device and doubles as a home button. It doesn't bother me at all, and it's fast and responsive, but some people dislike the fingerprint reader on the front. I downloaded Nova Launcher and set up gesture controls so that it opens up Google Now when I tap it from the Home screen. I use swipe up and down gestures, so I don't like the \"Swipe left for Google Now\" on stock Android.\n\nThe speakers are LOUD. Most people would see this as a positive, but in my case it's almost too loud. It supports Dolby Atmos and has two speakers - one in the earpiece and one on the bottom. Even with the volume turned down to the lowest setting it's still loud enough to fill a room. I've tried adjusting the settings and turning off Dolby Atmos, but it doesn't seem to affect anything. I would try a factory reset but for now I've just settled on keeping it silent. I silence it most of the time anyway. \n\nOverall, this is probably my favorite phone that I've owned in spite of the aforementioned issues. It's excellent for listening to podcasts, and in fact I did just that during a 6-hour drive to Jackson, MS this week. It does everything I need it to, and since it's getting Android 9.0 I can see myself keeping it through the end of next year.

I'm willing to spend around 400 euros for that new device but the more time I spend researching, the more I think I should spend twice as much ( which I would actually never do and couldn't even do).\n\nThe stupid thing about it all is that I don't even have the money to buy a new phone right now, but just can't stop looking on the internet.\n\nBut whatever phone I find, there is some point that bothers me so much (even though they aren't necessarily THAT bad things) that I scrap my idea.\n\nWhen I saw the G6, I liked it a lot. I still like it and LG has always been my homie company. I always felt some kind of sympathy for that company. But whatever article I'm reading about it, there are downsides. \"Only an older snapdragon, problems with ratio, blabla this blabla that\". And it drives me insane.\n\nOnePlus 5T. It seemed like the perfect choice. Then again, I'm always about insecure about companies that haven't been around for such a long time. Ok, personal problem. Oh , no IP68. Oh, 500 euros. Oh, late updates. Shit.\n\nHonor 9 has a high SAR Value, S7 a shitty UI, Huawei looks exactly like Apple and has bad battery life.\n\nWhy? Is it me? Am I just too perfectionist and expecting too much bang for my money?\n\nI don' even know why I have that much trust issues, if we take the G6 for example, I wouldn't probably even notice the weaker processor.\n\nBut still it's bothering me. I also noticed that a lot of judgement comes from my relation towards the brand itself. I know it's not necessarily the case, but whenever I think about buying a chinese phone I think of people that work for 14 hours straight just to finish my phone.\n\nI know this may sound extremely stupid to you but I'm not that type of person that could accept that easily.\n\nWhat should I do? Save so much money and then buy the absolute top smartphone of that time? Or just accept that there will always be some kind of flaw, some better phone and stop being so perfectionist about it?\n\nPlease take this serious, this is a big problem for me. When my mom bought a phone, she didn't even think an hour about it, went to that shop bought it and that's it.\n\nBut I always spend so much time and get so obsessed over that decision.\n", "created": 1521569474.0, "replies": [{"text": "Kinda hard to get an ip68 phone for 400 eur unless you go for the Moto X4.\n\nTo be honest there is no perfect phone.

Ok, personal problem. Oh , no IP68. Oh, 500 euros. Oh, late updates.

If it is on sale it is safe to use. \n\nS7's UI is in no way shitty. It is actually a pretty good phone.  The UI might not be aosp android but it works well enough. The only problem I had with it was that it deteriorated really fast.\n\nHuawei's phone all come with or are getting project treble so you can replace their interface with an aosp rom. But yeah, their software is kinda bad.\n\n&gt; What should I do? Save so much money and then buy the absolute top smartphone of that time? Or just accept that there will always be some kind of flaw, some better phone and stop being so perfectionist about it?\n\nProbably just accept it. I never wanted a 5\" inch phone, I wanted a 4.7\" phone.. that was the perfect size. Now I have a 5.5\" OP5 because that's the best I thought money could buy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWell, after all that... here are my recommendations:\n\n* Nokia 7 Plus. Looks like one of the best mid-range phones. Comes with oreo out of the box(which means project treble). Great Design. Great UI. OEM with fast android updates. Snapdragon 660 (good). 399 eur price. No water resistance. Out in april 12 in germany, april 1 in spain.\n* Zenfone 5. Also looking to be a great value mid-range phone. Comes with oreo. Slower Snapdragon 636. Unknown price but should be below 400. Should come out in april but specific date is unknown AFAIK. It has a notch. :S\n* Galaxy A8. Water resistance, good camera, nice looking hardware, below 400 EUR. Won't get Oreo until later this year (I think), updates are slow.\n* Honor 9. Forget about the SAR value. Update to Oreo and install and AOSP rom.\n* Moto X4. Not the best phone but has water resistance.\n* Oneplus 5t. Spend a little more and get this awesome phone. Fastest phone in the list. Good UI. Oreo update, but no treble. \n\nI think I just convinced myself to buy a Nokia 7 Plus. It looks like a totally amazing phone.\n\nAll phones in the list come with headphone jacks in case that's something you care about.\n\nBTW, there is also the Zenfone 5z coming out sometime this year. It is the same as the Zenfone 5 but with a snapdragon 845 and 500 USD price (hopefully similar in europe).", "created": 1521586971.0, "replies": [{"text": "Thanks for your extensive reply, I really appreciate this!

In which case, just attack the aux adapter to your headphones and use them as normal. Other wise, use some $20 bluetooth buds.\n\nThere's the One Plus 5T. It's like the S8 and Pixel in that, it's a spec monster, has stock android, ROM support (if you're into that), and lots of features added onto stock android. And it's a few hundred bucks cheaper, but that doesn't change the fact it's a flagship level phone like the S9 and Pixel 2.\n\n\nThen there's the Huawei Mate 10 Pro, if you want to try a brand that's great but not yet mainstream. It's like Samsung. Spec monster, lots of features added onto android, and their own skin. It's a great choice if you can deal with EMUI, but for me that usually means a different looking Settings app and a different looking notification panel.\n\n\nSome key highlights is that the S8 has audio port, best OLED display. The pixel 2 has the best software support and camera. The 1+5T has the best ROM support, so you can continue to mod it long after manufacturer doesn't update it, and the Huawei has the best bang-for-buck, while still maintaining flagship quality stuff (if EMUI doesn't phase you. Though, if Touchwiz didn't, then neither will EMUI).\n\n\nYou really can't go wrong with any, but only these I could recommend.\n\nLG has has bad quality control issues for the last 3-4 generations of their phones, and Motorola got bought out by Lenovo so while their phones can be good, the camera isn't good and the software support leaves a lot to be desired.

I'm looking for good or outstanding battery life, **lots** of storage, medium-small form factor, and a great camera. \n\nThis portion is background, so I've put the TLDR at the top. I have been using a company-paid iPhone 5S with 16GB on AT&amp;T. At one point I had the iPhone 6 (new at the time), and eventually I became accustomed to its larger size. Due to my own clumsiness, I had to get it replaced and was given the 5S. I like the size of the 5S in my hand, though I do admit my screen is pretty small for looking at pictures and video. Normally I'm not a photographer, but when I want to take videos or pictures I want them to look crisp and clean. Perhaps AMOLED is the way to go rather than IPS? I've gotten annoyed having to recharge my phone twice or more a day so I want my battery to last at least until night or possibly overnight. As noted earlier I got stuck with 16GB storage, and now I am forced to constantly unload apps and must have less than 15 photos or several videos. It's driving my crazy! With that in mind I think 64GB or 128GB would be ideal. I'm also leaning towards continuing with AT&amp;T as they have the closest 4G coverage behind Verizon (at least after a &lt;15 minute Google search) and cost less than Verizon. Whether I go contract or upfront is still TBD. I've also heard the Google Pixel is the best for photos and (I believe all Androids have this) has built-in Google Assistant integration which is hands down the best AI to date.\n\nI look forward to the world of Reddit lending its expertise and advice!\n\n", "created": 1521486213.0, "replies": [{"text": "Pixel 2. \n\n", "created": 1521496615.0, "replies": [{"text": "If I wanted to get that, I would have to buy it unlocked right?

I had a Droid Turbo 1st Generation back in February 2017 when it suddenly stopped receiving text messages. The phone was over two years old and I had a \"free\" upgrade from Verizon, so I figured it wasn't a big deal--I would just get a new phone and it would be fine. I got my Pixel (1st gen) and I still couldn't receive texts, so I talked to Verizon and they told me I should be using their Message+ app instead of the standard SMS app that started on the phone. I switched to that, and even though it's an ugly and slow app, I did receive texts most of the time. About 5 months ago my phone stopped being able to send texts about once a day, and I would have to power cycle my phone for it to be able to send texts again. It didn't matter if I was connected to WiFi or 4G LTE, or how much signal strength I had, it would just not let me send texts sometimes. So I went to a Verizon store and they just said that that's not actually a problem, and that I should be power cycle my phone at least once a day anyway. They didn't do anything to help. I'm on a plan with four others and they have never had any problems with texting, but now I've been having problems for well over a year, and just this week my phone can't connect to WiFi or LTE, which I don't think is Verizon's fault, but my phone is barely a year old and it's in great condition and I just don't understand how it has so many problems. I'm sick of dealing with it and just want a reliable phone and carrier. I want to stick with an Android, but was wondering if I could get some advice about what carrier and phone to choose. \n\nDiscrete info:\n\nCountry: United States\n\nCarrier: Currently Verizon but want to change\n\nPrice: Any\n\nContract: Not too picky, but off contract would be nice\n\nSize Preference: Not important - I just want a phone that can text reliably and use GPS\n\nWhat will it be used for?: texting, GPS, occasionally as a wireless hotspot\n\nPreferred brands: I have an irrational distaste for Samsung, so I would prefer anything but Samsung unless you want to make a strong argument for them.

For some reason the chinese version got some upgrades.\n  * Huge 4000 maH battery.\n  * Headphone jack.\n  * In design it's not my favorite, but it isn't bad looking either.\n  * 5.99\" 18:9 screen.\n  * Snapdragon 636, which is a little better than the 630. (afaik)\n  * Micro-usb (Depending on your situation this can be a bad or good thing. My laptop and switch use usb-c,it is convenient to use only one charger when traveling)\n  * Oreo + Treble\n  * You can buy it from [gearbest](https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_1660531.html?wid=4).\n* **Sony Xperia XA2**. A little above your budget at 319eur for the silver color in amazon.\n  * 3300 mAH battery. It also has a smaller screen than the other devices so battery life should be really good. GSMArena gave it a really good battery life rating.\n  * Headphone jack.\n  * I like the design, but understand that it is not for everyone. (it is bulky)\n  * 5.2\" 16:9 screen.\n  * Snapdragon 630\n  * USB-C\n  * Oreo + Treble\n  * You can buy it from [amazon germany](https://www.amazon.de/Sony-Smartphone-Display-Speicher-Android-Silber/dp/B078KJLY9T/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522721123&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=xa2&amp;th=1)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*One more thing, in case you care about project treble and/or being able to flash custom roms. The Nokia 6 and 7 Plus have some obscure ways of unlocking the bootloader right now(which is needed to install a custom rom, a customized version of android). In the long term it could become easier or impossible to do it.\n\n*AFAIK all of these phone have support for all germany 4g bands.\n\n*All of these phone have at least 32gb of storage and microSD card slot.", "created": 1522721838.0, "replies": [{"text": "Holy shit, thanks a lot for all the information!", "created": 1522741745.0, "replies": [{"text": "\ud83e\udd13", "created": 1522741770.0, "replies": []}]}, {"text": "I'm hesitating between the Redmi Note 5 and the Nokia 7 Plus.

Besides this, you could always go for any Android One phone and replace all of the apps (replacing means you'll install privacy focused alternatives on your device for the Google apps).\n\nI use the following apps:\n\n* Firefox Focus for incognito browsing\n* Firefox with uBlock and DuckDuckGo for privacy\n* OmniNotes for my notetaking (instead of Google Keep)\n* ProtonMail for secured emailing\n* Signal as my SMS client\n* You could go with VPN clients or adblockers\n* OpenStreetMaps and OpenWeather (not ideal..)\n* I use a fake Google account for everything besides app store\n* My true Google account is being used on Firefox browser.\n\nSo Android really depends on how you set it up. I'm not sure if Nokia's are available in your location, but the most recent ones (Nokia 6 v2 / Nokia 7 Plus) both run Android One and provide security updates really fast! They fall more in the mid-range category, while the V30 falls in the high end.\n\nAlso I believe major tech bloggers are overreacting with Android not being private enough. Mostly you can turn off apps, opt-out of sharing user analytics and just don't give unnecessary permissions. It will help a lot. By the way; every app can be turned off and you'll never see it again, even though you can't uninstall it.\n\nIt's also useful to check out F-Droid for free and open source apps. The developers usually don't benefit from (personal) user data, so in general apps from there are considered more private. \n\nHope this was useful! \n\nPS. If you get more experienced you could also install a custom rom (alternative modified software) that's built by a developers community. That way you can have most things in own hands. There is even something called MicroG if you unlock/root your phone. With MicroG you can fake a Google service so you can use phone without barely any Google interference.", "created": 1522611582.0, "replies": [{"text": "This is the answer that I was looking for.

I would just get the newest oneplus or pixel, except I refuse to because of one caveat: I don't purchase amoled phones.

As my Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is showing that 8 GB is nowhere near enough in 2018, I need a new phone. I'm not an advanced user, but I do want something that will last for years to come. I plan on getting it from a carrier since I have the opportunity. I don't really have a budget, but I don't want to spend too much while I want something that will last at least next 3 years. I also wouldn't like to have a thief magnet, I wouldn't feel comfortable with something really desirable.\n\nCountry: Croatia\n\nCarrier: Hrvatski Telekom\n\nPrice: On contract, so it will be cheaper than off contract, but let's say something up to equivalent \u20ac550 off contract\n\nSize Preference: Compact size. 5,2\" max if we're talking about 16:9 screens, but I'd prefer to have an 18:9 screen. I use the swipe keyboard so I'd like to have an option to use it with one hand.\n\nWhat will it be used for: Calls, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook. Probably a few other apps, but nothing really advanced. Definitely not for gaming.\n\nPreferred brands: Huawei and Samsung. Nokia, LG and HTC could do it as well, but they aren't preferred. Since I'm buying it on contract, no OnePlus, Xiaomi or other \"alternative\" brands.\n\nOther: Fingerprint scanner preferred, same with quick charging. 32 GB of internal memory minimum. Preferably something that isn't desirable for thieves.\n\nSo far, my preference list looks like this, from top to bottom:\n\n-Huawei P10: so far the best option of them all, but the 16:9 display bothers me.\n\n-Huawei Mate 10 lite: the only phablet I'd consider, since it has a one-hand keyboard mode. Lacks fast charging for its battery size.\n\n-Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017): good, but I'm not sure it will last for 3 or more years to come. 16:9 display bothers me a bit.\n\n-Huawei P smart: also good, also not sure it will last for 3 or more years. 18:9 display is a big plus.\n\n-Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018): heard it's a bit slow. It's quite pricey for what it is.\n\nAs you can see, I'd like to have something that will last as long as it can, but I'm slightly worried that apps will one day be optimised for 18:9 displays, rendering 16:9 display phones useless. That'd be especially annoying in Instagram. If it weren't for that, I'd go with the P10, as I trust that flagships will last longer than mid-range phones.

(Xpost r/andriodquestions)", "text": "Hello, I'm looking to get a new phone, specifically a current flagship in the USA (verizon).  I think I've narrowed it down to the Pixel 2XL, but I wanted to run it by this sub and see if there are better options for what I want to do.  Basically I'm unsure if the Pixel 2 XL is the right phone based on my criteria, and I'm less sure if what I want to do with the phone can be accomplished other ways.  I'd greatly appreciate help picking a phone and the best apps/ways to go about doing the following:\n\n**1.)** Block all ads (or as many as possible) on the phone *without using VPN*.  For youtube there is vanced or newpipe and for browser there is firefox with Ublock.  But for the rest of the phone I think you need to root and get adaway or something similar to eliminate all ads without using a VPN.  Is this true?  The Pixel 2 XL decision follows along from here, because if I need to root I don't want to void the warranty and as far as I know only Google has a current gen flagship where you can root and not void it.  Not to mention very easy bootloader unlock.  But if there is a way to block all ads without root or VPN on another flagship I'd be keen to know.  I know SABS/Adhell was a thing for the S9+, but it seems samsung will continue to make that difficult.\n\n**2.)** Not break safetynet and retain certified playstore while priority #1 is in effect.  In other words I use netflix and need it to work properly.  I'm assuming this means magisk would need to be flashed *prior* to the factory image now?  If I have to root to do #1 that is.  Again this seemed to lead me to Pixel 2 XL as it is probably the easiest to get stock images, and hardest to bootloop if I fuck up (which as a relative n00b I might do), and if I do I believe I can still send it in.\n\n**3.)** Minimize 2nd and 3rd party data mining/spying.  I'm not quite ready to go with a google-less phone running only FOSS and LineagOS or something.  Maybe someday.  But for now I'd just like to minimize the amount of data that leaves the phone, and the companies that get to access it.  My understanding is that the Pixel as setup above will probably only have google+carrier receiving data, which again seems a notch better than say sony or samsung also getting access to said data.\n\n**4.)** As much reliability and stability as possible.  It sounds bad, but the easier things are and *the less I need to think about/fiddle with them the better*.  I have too many other projects to tinker on, this just needs to be a daily driver.  I'm willing to sacrifice a bit here to satisfy #1-3, but I just want to make it clear on this phone I'm not going to be flashing new ROMs each week.  My understanding is that if I do need to root, OTA updates will be a no-go and every time I want to update, I'll have to re-flash everything basically.  Not very desirable, and if there was a better alternative I'd take it, but not the end of the world.  This is where I really don't know if Pixel 2 XL would be best, as I understand it the updates come faster than most.  \n\nOther than that, long battery life is a plus.  Please let me know what you all would recommend I do to meet these criteria as best I can, both in terms of which phone to get and then how to set it up to meet them.  Also please correct anything I may have wrong above, I am by no means an expert.

It's a great upgrade offer for me to upgrade from the 5x and I'm going for it. The whole deal comes it at the retail price of the phone, spread over two years, without having to fork out upfront.

It's not that th panel isn't bright, it is. It's more that the colours are a little washed.

I was in the exact same place as you before so I have done quite a thorough research about this. So it has a full windows 10 (which I dunno how they did it cause Windows key is like \u00a390 on its own) and it has android lollipop. It is stock/near-stock android and there is no skin. I use android most of the time just to read a few pdfs but when I need to type a document or something, I switch over to windows 10. Xiaomi is, like you stated, a more premium brand so I think their products are overall better in terms of build quality. Chuwi hi 8 has a glass screen but other than that, it's plastic everywhere. In regards to your question about the usability of windows 10 in Chuwi Hi 8 pro, it's definitely usable. A little slow at times but overall defo usable. I chose not to download chrome though because it only has 2gb ram and chrome will eat it like it's nothing. Xiaomi might also be better in terms of customer service since they are a bigger and kind of an international company.
