It's definitely time for an upgrade as the camera, battery and all those things are nearing its end. For a new phone, I'm happy to spend some money but don't thing a new S9 is a smart decision ($$$) - perhaps there is a better option for me. Out of the S6, S7, S8, was there one that was rated higher, or ones I should avoid? A good camera is important. I don't watch movies or play games. I don't like larger phones (like XL models, etc)\n\nI have been eyeing off the Pixel 2 but am really on the edge when it comes to the absence of headphone jack (I am listening to music/podcasts daily). I am happy to look at another Android phone outside of the Galaxy range, but am unsure where else to start.\n\nSo since I've been looking at the Pixel 2, my budget is about $800AUD\n\n\nFurther details:\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nCarrier: Unlocked\n\nPrice: ~$800AUD\n\nSize Preference: I don't like larger phones, so just normal size is what I'm after.\n\nWhat will it be used for: Podcasts, video/camera is important.\n\nPreferred brands: At this point I'm looking at Samsung and Google Pixel, but open to something else\n\nOther: 64gb is sufficient (if I can expand via micro SD then that's great).", "created": 1521418172.0, "replies": [{"text": "The S8 sounds like a great fit for you.

This would be worth doing if I can get something that will be an upgrade from my current phone, and last me 2 or 3 years until I need to upgrade again.\n\n**Country**: UK\n\n**Carrier**: Ideally I would like to stay on a rolling contract with Giffgaff as it is reasonably priced, and I like the option of being able to change the contract at any time, or to cancel it if I will be abroad for an extended amount of time e.g. travelling for a number of months.\n\n**Price**: Off contract. Ideally I would like to pay around \u00a3300. But it looks like a lot of phones are more expensive than that so I could stretch to up to \u00a3450.\n\nSize Preference: My current OP3 has a 5.5 inch screen and I would not want a screen smaller than this. Open to any screen size bigger or equal to 5.5 inch.\n\n**What will it be used for**:\n\n* Occasionally watching films.\n* No gaming.\n* I would like the option to be able to torrent but unlikely it will be used for this very often if at all.\n* Streaming Google Play Music.\n\n**Preferred brands**: The hassle of getting my OP3 screen fixed is pretty annoying. It would be great if I could pop down to a local shop and get it fixed. Local shops I have asked about fixing this want \u00a3200 to fix it, which is more than the phone is worth second hand. OP3 will fix for \u00a3100 but I would have to send to Poland and I'm guessing it could take weeks to get back to me.\nI'm guessing a more common or 'main stream' phone would be easier/cheaper to fix? If so, this would be a bonus\n\n**Other**: \n\n* Physical navigation buttons preferred (menu and back buttons). I don't want to have to take up part of my screen to have back button and menu button.\n* Headphone jack essential.\n* Fingerprint unlocking essential.\n* Notification light light essential.\n* 64gb storage bare minimum. More would be preferred.\n* Waterproofing would be great to have so that it can be used on a motorcycle.\n* Fast charging would be great. OP3 dash charge is fantastic.\n* Not hugely bothered about android version but I would like to avoid bloatware wherever possible. Definitely no facebook app.\n* I might root it, my current OP is rooted but I don't really use many rooted features.\n\n**Summary:\nMid range phone with 5.5 + inch screen. Fingerprint unlocking essential. Waterproofing preferred. Headphone jack essential. \u00a3250-450 price range.**", "created": 1521394073.0, "replies": [{"text": "Well, the S8 has been slashed a bit.

I'd personally pick that one, because the size is good (5,7\"), it has fast charging, a good display and a huge battery. \n\nNokia 7 Plus is too expansive (\u20ac399) when you can get a Xiaomi for much less money (\u20ac225). I think if you need one now which comes closest to the OnePlus, I'd get the Xiaomi Mi One.

My backup phone was pretty tall with a 5 inch screen which I liked as well (BLU R1 HD).\n\nI'll be using my phone primarily for long video streaming and some light gaming here and there (mostly for my weeb gatcha games), but it'd be nice to have a **good** **processor**, as the most intensive thing I'll probably be using is Snapchat funnily enough. I'm used to the processing power of the LG G4, so something above that level would be nice. \n\nBy far however, the most important thing to me would be a **good camera** paired with a **good battery**. Again, the LG G4 was my benchmark as the camera on that phone was amazing, but the battery for my use was abysmal (heck, I'd be glad to have another G4 if LG as a company didn't spite me with the bootloop, battery, and overheating issues).\n\nIf anything's extra really, I'd like to have **NFC** on mine for Android Pay and relatively decent storage space (anything higher than 16 GB, that's killed my current backup phone), if not, then **MicroSD** compatibility. A fingerprint reader would be AWESOME (but probably unrealistic for my price point). If the phone were to get pricey if anything, I'd really like for it to be IP68 waterproof because I tend to be around pools a lot when on vacation.

Don't want a super huge phone because my hands are small enough as is, the 5x was just about perfect pretty much.\n\nWhat Will It Be Used For: Texting and taking pictures/video. Preferably I want it to just be quick. I don't want to play games or watch tv on it. Large storage, good-great cam, quick processor with decent ram. Currently own a 5X that's been going strong for 3+ years so I'm hoping to find something that can beat it. Only reason I am looking for a new phone is due to the 5x really being pretty slow at this point and consistently being out of storage.\n\nPreferred Brands: HTC/Nexus. No samsung, no apple. Open to less known brands as long as the reviews prove it to be reliable. Only reason I would like a brand phone like the Nexus again is because it's pretty easy to find cases for it and most apps don't have odd errors. It was at purchase just a pretty damn solid phone.

NFC kinda needs to be there, it's just too convenient to pass up. I don't know if old versions of android, or just different phones, will have an issue with my smart watch but in that case it should be compatible with an asus android watch. I lesser important feature is fingerprint unlocking, but I am a sucker for it so plus points for that I suppose but I can live without it.\n\nAdditionally, if anyone thinks I should just hold off and let the 5X truly reach the point where it dies because nothing in the 200-300 range will REALLY blow it out the water atm then I'm welcome to that opinion as well.

It is along the same lines of the LG K20 Plus however the screen is a little bit smaller at 5 in instead of 5.3 in, it only has 16 GB of internal storage versus the 32GB in the K20 Plus. But it has some sort of Splash Resistance where the K20 plus isn't certified for any type of water resistance. But being that it has not been sold through T-Mobile you would probably have to find an unlocked MetroPCS model which would work just fine on T-Mobile as long as it is unlocked.\n\nI've heard good things about the zMAX Pro which is also a higher-end entry level phone with a 6-inch screen. I think it has a Snapdragon 617 processor in it so it won't be as fast or as battery-saving as the Snapdragon 625 but it should be pretty good in performance versus anything with a Snapdragon 417/425 /435 processor. There aren't any Mint Condition ones available on swappa right now but a good condition one is under $100.\nhttps://swappa.com/buy/zte-zmax-pro-tmobile\n\nYou also have the option of going with something that is 1 year older like the LG G5 that you can find for right around $100 on swappa. The performance will be significantly better on those however I've heard of a couple small bugs here and there, I've heard there are Bluetooth bugs and GPS bugs.

My Mom's Huawei is 6.1 inches and while huge, I love it.\n\n- 32 GB storage. Or 16 GB if it can take an SD card for expansion.*\n\n- $125-$199. I know, we are cheapos. I am hoping to find something decent at this price range. I'm OK with refurbished.\n\n- Android. I think this is obvious, but I'll say it.\n\nMy mom uses a [Huawei MT2L03](https://www.walmart.com/ip/HUAWEI-Ascend-Mate-2-MT2-L03-16GB-Unlocked-GSM-4G-LTE-Android-Phone-Black/42287058). I am tempted just to get that, but am wondering if anyone knows of something a little more recent/powerful/better that would be in our price range.\n\nThank you and if you don't mind, get off my lawn!

Here are the global criterias I'm looking for in order of importance:\n\n* Vanilla Android system on latest version, with Android updates coming ASAP (this was the thing I loved the most on the Nexus line). I just discovered that Google is ending the major OS support for Nexus phones so a Nexus 5X isn't a good option.\n* Great components, able to last several years without any problem. In the big lines, I'd like good cameras, both back and front; a good battery and 32GB of storage at least (MicroSD card slot is a plus but totally optional). Bonus points if it has at least 3GB of RAM and a nice CPU, but if the price isn't too high.\n* A 3.5mm jack. This sounds dumb but it's really important.\n* SIM-unlocked and works with Europe data carriers.\n* I'm not really aware of how did the prices evolve since I've stopped following the Android smartphones evolution a few years ago, but is \u20ac300-\u20ac400 a reasonable price range? Don't hesitate to link phones outside this price range though, I'm definitely not against the idea of putting more money to get what would really fit me.\n* NFC.\n* Everything else is optional. I don't care about fingerprint, USB-C or not, Bluetooth version, screen size (I prefer 5\" but I don't really care), weight, etc. Hell even weird button placements wouldn't be a problem, it's just a matter of getting used to it.\n\nThe main usages will be (in order) music, photography, application development and gaming.\n\nAfter doing some research I found the Pixel to be quite what I was looking for, but it's expensive as hell.

It is also very unstable, and reboots randomly at least once a day. Yes, I've tried a fresh install of everything.\n\nI need a new phone that I can rely on. At work, a larger screen (~Galaxy S6) would be nice for navigation while driving, and I occasionally perform inspections so I need to be able to take photos with relative ease. While working from home, I set my phone on the wireless charger (but could do without) and usually have some headphones plugged in listening to music, then just set the phone in a front pocket when I need to take a phone call. My phone is used for listening to music and running apps while exercising (e.g. Zombies, Run! or Spotify). I also do a lot of home automation work, so being able to utilize tasker would be nice.

When I bought the phone, I unlocked the bootloader and flashed Lineage 15.  The first two months I've had the device I was with AT&amp;T and got full LTE.  In early February, I switched to Verizon, and now I can't get LTE data or advanced calling (simultaneous voice and data).  Apparently this is a known issue when flashing an Oreo ROM with this device, and there's no fix at present - even going so far as to relock the bootloader and flash back to stock doesn't fix this issue.\n\nSo it looks like I'm going to have to get another phone, because 3G only is driving me nuts.  I'd stick with the G5+, but the slow pace of official updates and Motorola's poor device support track record make me think twice about getting one and sticking to stock.  So I'm in need of some advice on what to get next.\n\nAs far as needs/wants:\n\n * I mostly do web browsing, email, Facebook, and Twitter on this thing, as well as occasionally watching videos on YouTube or Netflix/Amazon/Hulu.\n * My price point tops out around $550.\n * An unlockable bootloader is a must.\n * Stock Android is HIGHLY preferred (or if the device has a 98% functional custom ROM, that's fine too).\n * I also want to stick with a vendor that's on top(ish) of security updates and version upgrades.\n * An all day battery is also a must.  My SOT averages 4-6 hours a day.\n * 4GB of RAM and 32GB storage (or more) preferred.  An SD card is preferred, but by no means necessary.\n * Headphone jack is preferred, but also not a must.\n * Same size screen as the G5+ would be nice, so 5ish inches.\n * A fingerprint reader that supports gestures would also be a plus.\n\nIn terms of my shortlist as it is, here's what I've got:\n\n *  HTC U11: I've always had a soft spot in my heart for these guys since my first phone was theirs (an Aria).  That being said, this is above my price point, and the phone doesn't terribly excite me, but maybe there's someone here who can confirm my bias towards this phone.\n * OG Pixel: Got a buddy who loves his, and it checks most of my boxes.  I'm thinking this is my best option, but I can't shake the feeling that this phone isn't for me.\n * Essential PH-1: I love the look of the device and the company ethos, but I've heard that this thing has had SO many issues.  I hesitate to pull the trigger since I know it's had so many problems.  If there are any current users lingering about, I'd like to hear how the phone is doing today.\n\nOf course, I'm also open to any other suggestions.\n\nTIA!\n\nEdit: formatting", "created": 1522178647.0, "replies": [{"text": "one plus five or moto z2 force (only $375 at t-mobile and you can get the free Alexa moto mod too).

The thing is without a big resale value on the OP3 (I'll repair it and sell it but not much gain there probably), it is even more the case.\n\nFrom the OP3, I loved the snappy performance (including the crazy fast fingerprint reader compared to my previous iPhone 6), great screen (even if only 1080p but seriously don't think I need more), quick charge (that is so good but I guess it's not required if the phone has a good battery for the entire day).

If the phone is already unlocked you should be all set to go, but if it's locked you can usually take it to the original carrier and as long as the phone has been paid in full they'll almost always unlock it.\n\n* **If meeting in person, meet in a safe place**.

If your looking for a phone to use for a long time, I would choose the Moto X4, over the Huawei phones. If updates don't matter to you as much, the Huawei's will do just fine. Also IMO, the X4 has a bit nicer build quality than the Huawei.\n\nIn order to get the Moto X4 Android One edition, you have to buy it from Google's Project Fi, which is a no contract carrier. In order to receive the discount, you will have to activate it on the Project Fi Network. If you dont, Google will charge you the the extra amount to make up for the discount.

It's got even more pretty colors to pick from, it's waterproof, and it's renowned for its camera. The fingerprint button is still on the front, though it definitely looks less \"clicky.\" Probably compatible with more networks as well. It's pricier at $650, but that might be worth it.

So they are effectively being pushed out of the us at the current moment. This won't matter to you if you're not in the us though. I do believe Amazon will still be selling the phone regardless.

My experience comes from switching to Android from an iPhone SE.\n\nTHE GOOD: Lots. I bought it used from B&amp;H Photo (grade 9 condition) for $159, no tax. The battery life is quite frankly amazing for a phone with a 1080p 5.5\" IPS screen. I can get a full day out of it easily with around 15-20% left at the end of the day. It also has a fingerprint reader AND NFC - usually you can find only one of those features but not both on a phone under $200. Build quality is near-flagship level. Software is pure Android with zero bloatware, and I just got the Android 8.0 Oreo upgrade (and HMD Global has committed to bringing Android P to it as well). \n\nThe screen isn't 18:9, but I don't even care.\n\nFinally, it has the necessary bands for T-Mobile (2, 4, and 12) and fully supports Wi-Fi calling. I'm using MintSim on it right now, but I will probably switch to MetroPCS at the end of this month because MintSim doesn't support Wi-Fi calling or Visual Voicemail on the Nokia 6. Numerous people have confirmed that those features do work on MetroPCS though.\n\nTHE BAD: Camera isn't great but gets the job done. Images are just average, and shutter speed is slow. If you're only a casual photo taker like me then it should suffice. \n\nThe Snapdragon 430 keeps things running smoothly for the most part, but lag is present every so often. To negate this, I turned on Developer Options and changed the setting for \"Background process limit\" to \"At most 4 processes.\" This will yield noticeable performance gains without you having to do anything else, but I also installed the Datally app to kill apps from sipping data in the background and SD Maid to regularly clear up any junk files. Now it's like butter.\n\nFingerprint reader is on the front of the device and doubles as a home button. It doesn't bother me at all, and it's fast and responsive, but some people dislike the fingerprint reader on the front. I downloaded Nova Launcher and set up gesture controls so that it opens up Google Now when I tap it from the Home screen. I use swipe up and down gestures, so I don't like the \"Swipe left for Google Now\" on stock Android.\n\nThe speakers are LOUD. Most people would see this as a positive, but in my case it's almost too loud. It supports Dolby Atmos and has two speakers - one in the earpiece and one on the bottom. Even with the volume turned down to the lowest setting it's still loud enough to fill a room. I've tried adjusting the settings and turning off Dolby Atmos, but it doesn't seem to affect anything. I would try a factory reset but for now I've just settled on keeping it silent. I silence it most of the time anyway. \n\nOverall, this is probably my favorite phone that I've owned in spite of the aforementioned issues. It's excellent for listening to podcasts, and in fact I did just that during a 6-hour drive to Jackson, MS this week. It does everything I need it to, and since it's getting Android 9.0 I can see myself keeping it through the end of next year.

I really love this phone and it served me very well over the years.\n\nUnfortunately, it's performance gets worse and my patience lower. Every lag, every stutter annoys me more and more and now I'm at that point where I finally want to buy a new phone.\n\nI usually research like a maniac before I buy a new phone. I know that this decision isn't forever, but I am so afraid of making a bad choice.\n\nMy first smartphone was a Samsung Galaxy S3. I was so obsessed about finding the right phone that I spent several months. I bought the S3 and it got stolen on a festival. What irony.\n\nThere are several phones right now that I somewhat like, even though I often feel like the last few years weren't that great years for smartphones. Somehow I feel like there is no real progress anymore and cases like the change from S8 to S9 prove that.\n\nHowever I can't really wait another year to finally buy a new device. I'm willing to spend around 400 euros for that new device but the more time I spend researching, the more I think I should spend twice as much ( which I would actually never do and couldn't even do).\n\nThe stupid thing about it all is that I don't even have the money to buy a new phone right now, but just can't stop looking on the internet.\n\nBut whatever phone I find, there is some point that bothers me so much (even though they aren't necessarily THAT bad things) that I scrap my idea.\n\nWhen I saw the G6, I liked it a lot. I still like it and LG has always been my homie company. I always felt some kind of sympathy for that company.

I also noticed that a lot of judgement comes from my relation towards the brand itself. I know it's not necessarily the case, but whenever I think about buying a chinese phone I think of people that work for 14 hours straight just to finish my phone.\n\nI know this may sound extremely stupid to you but I'm not that type of person that could accept that easily.\n\nWhat should I do?

No water resistance. Out in april 12 in germany, april 1 in spain.\n* Zenfone 5. Also looking to be a great value mid-range phone. Comes with oreo. Slower Snapdragon 636. Unknown price but should be below 400. Should come out in april but specific date is unknown AFAIK. It has a notch. :S\n* Galaxy A8. Water resistance, good camera, nice looking hardware, below 400 EUR. Won't get Oreo until later this year (I think), updates are slow.\n* Honor 9. Forget about the SAR value. Update to Oreo and install and AOSP rom.\n* Moto X4. Not the best phone but has water resistance.\n* Oneplus 5t. Spend a little more and get this awesome phone. Fastest phone in the list. Good UI. Oreo update, but no treble. \n\nI think I just convinced myself to buy a Nokia 7 Plus. It looks like a totally amazing phone.\n\nAll phones in the list come with headphone jacks in case that's something you care about.\n\nBTW, there is also the Zenfone 5z coming out sometime this year.

I have been using a company-paid iPhone 5S with 16GB on AT&amp;T. At one point I had the iPhone 6 (new at the time), and eventually I became accustomed to its larger size. Due to my own clumsiness, I had to get it replaced and was given the 5S. I like the size of the 5S in my hand, though I do admit my screen is pretty small for looking at pictures and video. Normally I'm not a photographer, but when I want to take videos or pictures I want them to look crisp and clean. Perhaps AMOLED is the way to go rather than IPS? I've gotten annoyed having to recharge my phone twice or more a day so I want my battery to last at least until night or possibly overnight. As noted earlier I got stuck with 16GB storage, and now I am forced to constantly unload apps and must have less than 15 photos or several videos. It's driving my crazy! With that in mind I think 64GB or 128GB would be ideal. I'm also leaning towards continuing with AT&amp;T as they have the closest 4G coverage behind Verizon (at least after a &lt;15 minute Google search) and cost less than Verizon. Whether I go contract or upfront is still TBD.

But the very first time it slipped out of my hand (indoors and on carpet, no less), the screen shattered beyond repair and it was unusable. Yikes.\n\nI also bought my fiance a matching Nexus 5x, which he also loved... until it randomly bricked itself maybe a week after mine went down.\n\nI learned how to completely take apart and diagnose the 5x over the course of a week, and after confirming the issue (his motherboard straight up failed) and getting the right tools, I went ahead and transplanted my phone's motherboard and internal whatnots into his phone's uncracked screen and created 1 working phone (for me) from the wreckage.\n\nThen, I bought one more Nexus 5x to replace his, so we were back at 2.\n\nMy frankensteined one worked great... for about 4 months. I woke up one morning and got an autoupdate from Google, and it instantly crashed my phone and sent it into an unfixable boot loop error, which it seems the 5x is notorious for. :(\n\nSucks because I LOVE the phone - big memory, good screen, unskinned android, good processor, not too expensive.\n\nI'm leaning away from another 5x since I keep getting screwed, but what's the next best thing? Or the one that's similar but more reliable?\n\nMy budget is ideally $250 or less.
