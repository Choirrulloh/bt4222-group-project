I thought that android phones could not have the scrolling smoothness, speed and slowing down effects as the iphone and that it was a coding limitation.

For me its -> \n1. Price/Performance;\n2. Screen to body ratio;\n3. Camera.  \n\nMy previous phone (iphone 7) sucked at 1st and 2nd, but was awesome at 3rd. No stress at all -> just click and you got a great picture. Not the case wth 1+3T. You have to work for good picture while indoors or outside in low light situations, and especially with moving objects. \nActually before 1+3T galaxy S7 (looks awesome, premium HW, great screen to body ratio, capacitive buttons, top of the line camera) was one of my choices after I decided to replace my iphone 7 (4,7\" screen is just too small..claustrophobic feeling.otherwise it was a great device and IOS has grown a lot, especially how well apps are improved with swipe left/right function (kind of copying back button), but I just could not go for since I never liked lagwiz (touchwiz). No matter the hardware, lagwiz (touchwiz) lags and you can't do anything about it. \n\nOn the other hand 1+3T in all other areas is one of the best phones ever owned. Few reasons which IMO make it one of the best phones ever: \n1.\tBattery life is the best I've ever had and even with stock ROM and kernel and no sacrifices like auto-sync off and so on..its simply great out of the box;\n2.\tGreat screen to body ratio;\n3.\tCapacitive buttons which are fully customizable;  \n4.\tVery light and comfortable for 5.5\" inch phone;\n5.\tGood looking design and impressive build quality;\n6.\tPremium feel *\n\n*something that is missing in other Chinese brands like Xiaomi for example \ufffd mi5 looks great but once you take it in your hand you understand why the price is as it is -  cheap plastic with no wooow to it.", "time": "9th December 2016, 01:34 PM", "postID": "post70005805", "replies": [{"text": "Also, Touchwiz's ram management just sucks.. hardware is awesome but software not so much.
