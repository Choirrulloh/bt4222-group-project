But I'm having some buyer's remorse. I still give it an 8 out of 10. A 10 would have been better than my previous in most categories, even if marginally. \n\nThe Pixel is more expensive than my 6P. It's subjectively uglier than my gold finish all metal 6P. It has no front firing dual speakers. It's speakers aren't as good as the 6P's. It has no 64gb option as my 6P did. And I know people may slate me for this, the 6P had a better camera. By a big margin. \n\nSo why the high rating? Well, the Pixel feels better in the hand. This is primarily due to the size. The build seems more solid and more dense. The software feels more natural, although this is hard to quantify. The Pixel doesn't exhibit any throttling that my 6P did, which is a huge improvement. It just seems a more polished finish.\n\nIt has excellent EIS and I think the 6P should have been given this as it's just software magic, AFAIK. But it is what it is. \n\nNo nightmares in the battery department. Quite stable in fact. My 6P was starting to drain quicker than I liked. \n\nDid I say it's the only viable smaller handset with top end hardware?

It is the best android phone I ever had (had the Nexus 6P, S7 Edge, G5, P9, HTC10, V10, Sony XZ, Oneplus 3), but i still think it is overpriced...\r\n          The build quality and design are not best in class, huawei, samsung, oneplus and sony make better built phones. It's not that Google Pixel is not well built, but the design is ugly as f__k, bezels are too big by any standards, screen is very good but poorly calibrated even in RGB mode, speaker is bearly above average, the aluminium used is not as high quality as the one in Iphone or Huawei, it has a white cloth covering the earpiece that gets dirty easy, has no IP67/68 rating, the back glass scrathes easily. I don't care about wireless charging. There are few pro's still, i love the buttons click and fingerprint sensor placement.\r\n          The display is very good, not the brightest or the most accurate (samsung is still king here), very good sunlight legibility and low power consumption.\r\nIt charges very fast, on point with s7 edge adaptive fast charge, but slower than OP3 with dash charge. Battery life is perfect, better than anything i ever had, even my Iphone 7 plus that wast the best before Pixel. \r\n          Perfect stand by times, very low power consumption for screen (i keep my screen very bright), doze is magic, as i get all notifications quick but with low power consumptions for apps.\r\n          The software is great, a little boring, but hey, better than iOS. No customisations comparing to a samsung or lg, but it's ok. Speed on the other hand... magic! Everything is instant, veeeeeeery fluid animations, no hangs, no force close, no nothing. It's iOS level of optimisation, years ahead any samsung or lg... \r\n          The camera is best i ever had. The most important aspect of a mobile phone for me is it's camera (back and selfie), and google pixel absolutly destroys every phone out there in dynamic range and is better than most in low light. Detail is superb, colours are very good, sometimes a bit saturated, had no trouble with lens flare (i think they fixed it). Focus speed and acuracy is just perfect. Video quality is there with the big boys (s7 and iphone 7). Selfie camera the best also, slightly ahead of sony xperia xz. Overall, best camera package on any smartphone to date (always keep HDR+ on), i think it will be better than s8 and g6, i allready know is better than Huawei P10.\r\n          What this phone has done better than all others, at least for me, is call quality and signal reception, my mother lives in an area where there are big signal issues with any carrier, and when i go visit her, Pixel XL is the only phone i had so far with almost full signal. (best until pixel were iphone and samsung).\r\n          So, long story short, i love my pixel xl, it is the best phone i ever had, on par with 2017 flagships so far (LG G6 ans Galaxy S8). It has it's cons: design, bezels and speaker, but those left aside, i think i will keep it until Pixel 2 or Iphone 8. The only phone that could mess up my plans is Galaxy S8 with that display...

Do you have a favorite yet? I'm torn between the Pixel and S7, too (plan to buy one of them). \n\r\nMy biggest problem with the S7 images I've seen is the same problem that I hate on my current Sony -- oversharpening artifacts on most high-contrast edges and aggressive, detail-destroying noise reduction in lower-light images. Sure, low noise and sharp edges make a photo look nice and punchy on a 5\" phone screen, but zoom in even a little or view on a monitor and they can look horrendous IMO. Yes the S7 can capture RAW, but not in auto mode.\n\r\nThe Pixel seems to avoid both those problems to some degree and to my (photographer's) eye they just look more natural and more like something approaching the output from a dedicated camera (although obviously there's no way phone-camera output can really compare to a DSLR). My opinion is that you can always sharpen and punch up the vibrancy of an image, but you cannot un-sharpen or punch-down an image.

What the reviews don't tell you is that the f 1.7 aperture means a very very narrow 'field of focus'.  i.e., large parts of the same photo will be blurry / out of focus. I am not talking about depth of field, I am well aware of what that is and the implication of the f 1.7. Depth of field applies to macro shots. What I am talking about is different parts of photos being out of focus even for landscape shots or general everyday shots where the entire photo is expected to be in focus. \n\r\nI got around this with my S7 era cameras by using pro mode and multi-AF with matrix metering. But pro mode cannot be set as default, so you had to launch the app and manually switch to pro mode each time. \n\r\nAnyway, I like the Pixel camera a lot. I think an f 2.0 is a good spec for a camera phone. Anything higher than that comes with too many compromises. There has been a lot of advancement in 2016 in smartphone camers, but they are all around the 12 mp resolution.

It's very *good*.  But after a week using it alongside my S7 and iPhone 7, I'd still rather have either of those in my pocket as my day to day shooter.

This can make for some really great shots, but it can also really underexpose if there's a focal point (like, I don't know, a person?) in the shot you're taking.  The Pixel also struggles with auto-focus, or its auto-focus simply isn't very intelligent.  \n\nExample, kids within a couple of feet of me... 5 shots with the Pixel, each one of them came out underexposed and with their faces blurry, even when I tried to get it to re-focus.  My iPhone 7 got them in one shot and properly exposed their faces.  In those shots, the Pixel's shots looked great in the background of the photo, but the focus of the pictures were not well-handled.  The iPhone 7's shot overexposed the background a bit, but it nailed the focus of the pictures the first time.  \n\nIt's a very good camera, but I think it's still a step below the top flagships from Samsung and Apple right now, when taking into account all aspects of the cameras.", "time": "29th October 2016, 05:45 AM", "postID": "post69357311", "replies": []}, {"text": "Examples?", "time": "29th October 2016, 07:09 AM", "postID": "post69357966", "replies": []}, {"text": "Okay so I'm gonna put it out there.

After getting a new device and still having issues I have an answer and partial solution to my terrible standby drain. The culprit in my case is LTE. I am on FIDO in Canada which does use Band 4 though I am not certain if that is being used in my area. Anyways if I set my preferred network type to 3g my standby drain improves dramatically as the device idles around 10-15ma in my pocket and overnight is more like 6ma which is phenomenal. As soon as I set my network back to LTE my standby drain is 70-90ma and at best 40ma overnight if I'm lucky. My cell service for 3g and LTE are both good (green in battery stats). I know LTE requires more power however I would expect that power requirement to drop significantly when connected to WIFI networks which in my case doesnt seem to matter at all. At least now my battery life is awesome as others have reported. However connecting to 3g when away from home is a bummer and it's not really practical to manually change my preferred network every time I leave or enter a WIFI area. Looking at a way to automate this switch but on Android 5+ it seems that changing these settings via app are very locked down. I would also like to point out that my previous phones never seemed to suffer from this issue which only further makes me suspect that there is an unresolved underlying issue here (maybe related to the Band 4 issues being reported?).

And then of course starting with the 6 you had four different colors I believe, three of them having the white touch screen.

But then my brother bought an iPhone and he gave me his old Treo 650, which was a great phone until my cat pawed it, and somehow broke the H key on the keyboard. That was when my brother had finally bought an iPhone 4 and gave me his original, that's when I got hooked on not just iPhones but all smart phones.

My first ever cell phone was a little piece of **** Siemens phone, I didn't even use it that much except that I had a phone when I was out. Eventually Cingular gave me a better fliptop Motorola phone, and then they gave me one with the camera and it even. Actually I dug those phones because they had a little music box built-in and you could create all these weird drumbeats and you could slide sounds around and make a little songs it was great. All I remember is between 2002 and 2008 or so, there wasn't really that much change with the cell phone market except with a few of the high-end phones like the Treo, and not very many people but those because they were really expensive at the time. But then when the iPhone came out and then the androids, there has been a an explosion of smart phones the likes of which will probably never end.

I did an EDM/Dubstep, standard voice, rock, and opera music test on the Pixel and Pixel XL compared to my Droid Turbo 2 and the iPhone 7 and 7+. This is what I came to:\r\n-Pixel and Pixel XL are quite loud for a single/mono speaker setup, about equal in loudness to my Droid Turbo 2. All were quieter than the iPhone 7 and 7+, which is expected given their stereo/dual speaker setup.\r\n-The iPhones possess a thin, metallic, tinny sound from both speakers, with a miniscule amount of bass or depth to the sound. The mids and highs were somewhat ear-piercing and overly sharp, and were overall not managed well. However, this is better than the S7 Edge from what I can tell, which sounded muffled, quiet, and tinny to me, when I watched a video on a Verizon display unit. However, I will have to do another test to truly give comparative results.\r\n-The Pixels were quieter than the iPhones off the bat, which is to be expected, since they have mono speaker setups. But, the sound out of both of them was exactly as loud as my Turbo 2, and the Pixel's speakers have an impressive amount of depth. Bass was definitely present here, moreso than the Turbo 2, and the sound was not thin by any means. The mids and highs were present and did not sound tinny or not properly recognized by the speaker. However, the treble lacked the \"wow\" factor in comparison of the Turbo 2, whose treble was more crystalline and more alive, as well. Not that the Pixels sounded dead by any means, because their treble was also well represented and sound, at that high of frequencies, was not distorted, like it was a little bit with the iPhones, playing high-frequency sound (treble) in the soundtracks I used, but the highs and treble were more enhanced. So, it seems like the Pixel is better suited for bass and lower frequency sounds, whereas my Turbo 2 is better suited for treble and higher frequency sounds.\r\n-In conclusion, the iPhones are OK in loudness for a dual-speaker setup, though their sound is thin, metallic and tinny, offering little to no depth of sound, especially compared to the Pixels, and not representing higher frequency sounds or voices properly, often falling apart in the treble compared to my Turbo 2. The Pixels are quieter than the iPhones, but offer the most depth of sound and bass of the three, and tie with the Turbo 2 for the least distortion of sound.
