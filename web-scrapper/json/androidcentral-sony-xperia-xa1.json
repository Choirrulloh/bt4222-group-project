This patch addresses security issues in Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. Please backup your phone beforehand and enjoy also as a side note which I have noticed everytime Xperia Transfer Mobile gets an update that means a system update is on its way. Usually within a week of the app update but today literally it was 10 minutes later after Xperia Transfer Mobile got updated.\nEnjoy all love as always \u00c9ire \ud83d\udc96", "time": "01-26-2018 02:23 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6175618", "text": "Hey!

Yes I would recommend this phone its a beautiful and quick device.\nThe camera is brilliant in low light conditions. It comes with 32gb on board storage with an expandable micro SD card slot. I have a class 10 SD card with 32GB as I don't really need much storage as I have integrated OneDrive online storage for pics, videos and music. It has a SwiftKey keyboard with very good autocorrection and you can customise the colour, layout and style. Now I have to say the media volume through headphones is really low in comparison with my Microsoft Lumia 640XL but I don't use my Xperia XA1 as a media player I use it for Apps and games. Speaking of games the 3GB ram makes games run seamlessly and produced beautifully with the large wide-screen look of the phones screen. Videos look stunning on here also you can record in HDR which bumps up the resolution to 4K viewing. I could go on but bottom line she will love this phone and I wouldn't be surprised if you decide to buy this too.\nHope this helps if you have any more questions I'm here for you.\n\u00c9ire \ud83d\udc96", "time": "03-06-2018 02:32 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post6183108", "text": "Thank you for the wonderfully helpful review.

Your better off not using third party apps to judge the health of your battery as the app may not be working with the latest info on your phone.
