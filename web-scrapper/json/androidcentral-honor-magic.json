Without beating around the bush, here\u2019s what you need to know about Honor Magic:Operating System- Magic runs on Android 6.0 with Honor Magic Live software out of the box and is completely different than EMUI but feels much lighter and smoother for sure. Huawei developers must have re-structured everything in the backend for a fresh look, design, smoothness and performance.Hardware- It is powered by Kirin 950 CPU processor, coupled with 4GB RAM for better performance and multitasking with 64 GB of internal memory. I opened all the apps but did not feel any lag or delay while doing so (Thanks to one of the support staff over there who helped me changing the language to English so that I could use and navigate across the settings).Display- The 5.09-inch device has a screen resolution of 2K (yes, you read it right, not 720P or 1080P. But way better!) and a 3D glass structure to give more strength and look to the device. Screen pixels look extremely real, vivid, sharp and crystal clear.Look and feel- It looks extremely premium in hand with completely re-structured design and a glossy finish. It looks awesome from any given angle and perfectly nestles into your palm for its decent size and the friendly bezel design. I felt comfy holding the glossy phone without any trouble or fear of the phone slipping off my hand.Battery- It is powered by a 2900 mAH battery with Huawei\u2019s Magic Power Fast-charging technology which could charge the phone up to 70% in just 20 minutes.Camera- It has 12 MP dual cameras with RGB+Monochrome support which is capable of taking good pictures even in low light. I took a couple of shots and selfies too.Connectivity - It supports the latest Wi-Fi bands and Bluetooth 4.2 and micro USB 2.0. Type C charging port helps in quick charging.\nPricing- It is available on Vmall.com, tmall.com, JD.com and suning.com at 3699 RMB, roughly around 36,200 INR.\nPlease share your thoughts on the same.", "time": "12-24-2016 11:32 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Honor Magic- Quick specifications.", "thread": [{"postID": "post5617039", "text": "Hey Guys,\nThis post is to quickly summarise the necessary specification of Honor Magic phone.Operating System- Android 6.0 with Honor Magic Live software Display- 5.09 InchScreen resolution- 2K screenAdditional screen info- Double 3D glassesCamera - Dual lens 12MP cameraProcessor- Kirin 950 CPURAM- 4GBInternal Storage- 64GB Battery - 2900mAh battery capacity Additional battery info- Huawei Magic Power (Fast-charging technology) Connectivity- 02.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, micro USB 2.0Camera rear- 12MP dual-lens rear cameraCamera front- 8MP front camera\nA magic photo taken from Magic, through magic and that's the Magic for you", "time": "12-22-2016 02:32 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Honor Celebrates Third Anniversary with Honor Magic", "thread": [{"postID": "post5617035", "text": "Continues to bring bold innovation to Digital Natives Shenzhen, China, December 16, 2016 \u2013 Honor, the world\u2019s leading smartphone e-brand for digital natives, celebrated its third-year anniversary with the launch of Honor Magic, a device packed with disruptive technology set to redefine expectations of smartphones.\nHonor owes its continuous success to its legions of fans all over the world.
