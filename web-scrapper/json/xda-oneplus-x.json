The SOT has nothing to do with it. Yeah i didnt know that soft reboot kept the wifi showing as on in the battery stats, but he also said it was a sleep of death due to undervolting so it was no soft reboot (or multiple ones). Either that or it was multiple soft reboots. Anyway, it doesn\u00b4t matter because those stats are not real usage, he didnt even reply anymore when he was questioned. Probably just left the screen on or something.\n\r\nI hate these BS posts because it makes other users feel impressed by those stats, which probably will end up with the user trying that rom hoping to get similar stats and go through the hassle of setting up a new rom and getting disappointed because it does not achieve anywhere near those stats, just because of a BS post with absolutely no info. I mean...8 hours sot with softreboots in between (taking away 10% of battery) and still have 10% battery left?
