I've been testing lately with different providers. The phone, in battery menu, mostly shows yellow or orange signal strenght under the battery bar. See the attached screenshots. My S3 shows mostly green bar, sometimes yellow or orange, in the same conditions. I would like to ask you: do you have something similar?", "time": "16th May 2016, 01:05 PM", "postID": "post66876137", "replies": [{"text": "my cell coverage looks the same\r\nnever had a problem with my nexus 4\r\nsadly i dont remember if this issue popped up with 2.2.0 or was there from the beginning", "time": "18th May 2016, 06:58 AM", "postID": "post66904298", "replies": []}, {"text": "UPDATE: I flashed the 2.2.1-X modems and the signal strength became normal\n\nORIGINAL TEXT:\nExact same situation with mine.
