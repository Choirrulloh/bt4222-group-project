Never any problems. Infact, I took it off charge this morning at 100% as normal. Obviously throughout the day the battery ran low so this evening I tried to charge it again but it would not charge. The only thing out of the ordinary that I did today was try to connect it to my car charger, I had tried this before and it didn't work, and indeed again today it did not work.\nI took it to the shop and they just assumed it was the port and said I would have to take it to the Sony shop to repair it. While I was there the battery went to 0% and switched off. I plugged it to the wall at home and the charging symbol showed on the screen and a red light, it also went in a loop of showing the Sony screen, like the phone was attempting to turn on, and then back to the battery screen. It didn't show a % but it showed the battery with a small bit of red at the bottom.\nI tried entering recovery mode where the phone vibrated 3 times and the red light turned blue. I got 25% charge in an hour this way and I turned on the phone which loaded normally but still will not charge.\nSo, basically the phone will only charge in recovery mode. Is there any fix for this or any explanation as to what has happened? I don't think it can be the port because it does charge, just not when it is turned on. Very inconvenient.

Ugh.\nFew days back I've had an accident where my stupid suitcase tripped me over with phone in hand. Smashed my screen badly, but music I listened to still kept playing xD And more importantly, the display is still working, and so are the side keys - camera can still be activated.\nI reached out for support in the official Sony Chat, but we sort of ran out of options. I mean fella #1 suggested USB OTG cable, which I've ordered, but no cursor showed up when I connected it today. And then fella #2 tells me on Android 5 it will only work if you enable it in Options... And of course how the hell to do this when the touchscreen is unusable and whole thing is locked -_- Bloody vicious circle.\nNow as a last resort, I am reaching out to you guys, but won't be at all surprised if I indeed have to send it for repair to someone non-Sony. Is there really no secret tricks with side keys or something? I am prepared to do lots of fancy stuff just to get to my data.\nThe reason why I badly don't want my data to be wiped is because it's months' worth of work of photos, with many important ones out there. A large portion of those were on my SD card, which I've already secured - but because of the amount of stuff I've racked up, many were no longer fitting on the external memory card and so had to be on the internal storage.

But let's see if some will work. \nFirst, the OTG cable they suggested is the best way to go, BUT you'll need a mouse to go with that. Make sure it's a standard USB mouse that won't require any drivers or extra power or it won't work. \nSecond, when you connect your phone to a computer, can you see the files? My guess is 'no' unless the phone has been unlocked, but if you weren't using a lockscreen, then that's one way to do it. If your phone is locked, you can try unlocking it remotely from the Android Device Manager (from the Play Store, go to the gear icon, you should see it there; for this to work Android Device Manager should not have been disabled as a device administrator on your phone). \nOther than that, not a lot you can do I'm afraid.

The speaker audio lacks the bass and fullness of the M9, but to me the Z5s sound sweeter and more musical than the M9s, but I reckon the Z5 issue maybe the weterproofing membrane they put on the Z5 speakers.. but theyre still good and a joy to listen too.\nBut where true quality lies is in the Headphones.. and man.. Is the sound amazing in headphones... and this is where you know you have a Walkman.. Wow.. blew my mind and blows away any phone or Ive ever used including the 24-bit G4 and M9. Ive tried both a set of LG Quadbeat 3s and Sennheiser 400s.\nAnd now for the major question.. and thankfully.. Yes the Camera is good, in fact it can be truely awesome... coming from a G4,. I can see how the G4 over-sharpened and over-processed its images, but the Z5 has a fantastic colour reproduction and accurate white balance. Lack of OIS isnt a big issue Ive found.. the images arent over sharpened and do have a \"realness\" to them.. they arent as \"sharp and crispy\"\" as the G4 or S6 but this is a good thing and the camera can turn out some beautiful shots. \nOne thing I will say about \"Auto Mode\", part of the reason for the softness, especially when zooming in is that the camera tends to set the ISO very low... even as low as 40, probably in order to combat noise... but this has an opposite effect as well.. in that it softens the image right down, this is something to be aware of as some people like crispy images and can give the impression of the camera under performing. In order to combat this.. Use Manual mode and set your ISO manually.\nFor everyday use 8Mpx is great and strangely enough... theres not that big a jump between 8 and 20mpx,, but the difference is there. One thing i did find with the camera is it can over-expose alot of the time.. but using Manual Mode and dropping the EV down half a stop (0 - 0.5) or even a full stop (0 - -1) fixes this.\nAlso, unlike the standard Z5, the Prem model, at least mine anyway, doesnt suffer from the poor camera quality alot of forum threads have mentioned.\nIm still on my first battery charge after 24 hrs (Im a light to mod user), but as with all new phones.. the battery needs 1-2 full cycles to fully \"wake up\", but so far Im quite pleased with it.\nSo im very happy with my new Z5 premium, and its hard to pick out an exact fault, other than the extremely low ISO settings, but Its fast, its fluid.. no lag, but coming from a G4 or S6, the camera imaging is \"different\".. but in a good way, but not worse.. it doesnt have the harsh over-processing, Great Music player.. and contrary to some forum posts.. Ringtones and Notifications are plenty loud enough, even with Volume set at 80 - 90% and with \"Increased Ringtone\" toggle \"OFF\"\nWouldve also been nice to see SONY include a set of Noise Cancelling headphones in the Box as a Premium.. or Wireless QI charging as standard on the Premium model, but in truth I guess Ide rather have the bigger screen and unlike trhe vanilla Z5, the camera that works.\nHope this helps you make a desicion....\nHave Fun", "time": "04-04-2016 04:56 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Mobile Data Issue", "thread": [{"postID": "post5081007", "text": "I'm not sure if this is a common Android issue, or specific to my device/carrier.\nSince I've had this phone, mobile data is so spotty.

The \"power users\", depending on all the typical conditions, should probably expect 5 to 9 hours of SOT in a typical high usage day. Here is their statement on battery: ****Battery life has been measured against Sony Mobile Communications AB\u2019s smartphone usage profile, defined in September 2014 to represent the typical smartphone user\u2019s active condition, including but not limited to a range of usage scenarios (calling, texting, web browsing, social networking, game playing, music listening, picture taking, picture browsing, online video watching, video recording and playback).Now, the September 2014 AVERAGE user... here's what they say about that: Typical Smartphone User usage profile. This involved using the device for approximately 5 hours in a 24-hour period, for a range of typical usage scenarios (calling, texting, web, social networking, games, camera, music and video).For context, the Moto X 2013 with a 4.7\" 720p AMOLED screen and SD600/2 lasted the average user between 20 and 24 hours and average SOT was between 3 and 4 hours. OF COURSE I am speculating, I don't have this device and haven't seen any serious reviews - this is based on analyzing their statements, what we know of the specs and what we know about how batteries actually function under load. The biggest two drivers of batteries suffering are typically poor idle (Apple has this fairly well under control) and the screen's power draw. If Sony has these two things under control (I assume they're most of the way there if they're making these claims) - then we can expect VERY solid battery life. But let's also be reasonable about what to expect. I'd hate to see people expect to get 10+ hours of SOT over a 24-48 hour period and then rage against the device because it's not there yet.", "time": "10-29-2015 06:36 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4787352", "text": "I just have a really hard time believing a 4K screen will have good on screen time.

I liked a few things from the G4 such as the smart settings and its nice to see that Sony have the same sort of thing.

Sure, I wouldn't mind a different design language, as Samsung have done, but then Samsung was notorious for being rubbish for that, so the only way was up.

After purchasing it I went off to read several reviews of the website as I had never been not heard of it before. It was actually pretty bad. Many consumers had very negative experiences and it had an overall rating of 2.6 out of 5 stars. I was completely stunned after reading people's reviews and comments but nevertheless, I gave it a try. I was sitting in class (I'm a college student) while surfing their website and I was ready to click the place order button. But at the same time I was utterly confused if I should use my money somewhere else. I looked to my left and the kid next to me was where in a Nike shirt with the logo \"Just Do It\". I looked back at my phone and without thinking I did it. I placed the order and shortly after I received an automated email from value basket stating that my order was being processed and would take up to 5 days. After 3 days I received another email stating that phone had been shipped. I was under the influence that this company was shipping It from the US since their website had a US domain. Apparently not. It was coming from Hong Kong. I was furious as I thought shipping would take weeks more. Fortunate for me, my phone arrived in 2 days. I was astonished as I quickly opened the package to make sure it was really the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium that I had long awaited. What a zest full moment it was. I began playing around with it and couldn't get over the 4k screen. I had a quite different experience then everybody else at value Basket as I had really received the phone and in just 5 days of placing the order. Also after writing on this forum, I updated the apn settings and I go finally got lte. I had the Htc one m9 before and I would get somewhere around 25-32 mbps tops on my home. With this phone however, I'm hitting 70 and above! The only tiny let down is that it doesn't show me the lte signal but instead the regular 4g one. I honestly don't mind though. But yes this is the story of how I purchased the Sony Xperia z5 premium. I'm quite happy I did and would recommend it to all of you. And as for the question someone posted about over heating, I can assure you it does not. I had the m9 and sometimes it would get so hot I couldn't hold it anymore. However this phone is a totally different experience. Sony did an amazing job placing dual copper pipes minimizing heat and I'm telling you it works great. I'm a heavy user and for me this phone hardly even gets warm. The camera is astonishing and mind blowing. I'd say in some conditions it beats the note 5 as well as my brothers s6 edge plus. It's a beast of a phone. Honest opinion. I am actually doing a short review on it.
