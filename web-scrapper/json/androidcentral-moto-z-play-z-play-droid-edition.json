Sometimes, all it take is flipping the usb C connector over and plugging it in and it takes off. Other times it simply won't charge without a reboot.

I've tried scanning different fingers, rescanned my fingers god knows how many times, made sure the sensor is clean, but it still regularly takes three or four attempts to unlock the phone now.

I came across a brand new Nexus 6p never even opened sealed in box and it's a 64g. The only drawback was the color. He happened to have the frost white model where I wanted the silver model but at the price he offered me there was no way I could pass it up. A brand new in box 64g Nexus 6p for only $150!!!

Anyone have any advice or tips on the device that is techy or handy to know? It reminds me a lot of my old Z Force. Actually I can't really tell them apart to be honest. This is a great device and it may overtake my beloved Honor 8 and my love for EMUI software away. I already had the speaker mod. I don't think I'm going to worry about a Tumi battery mod as this battery is massive by itself. So I'll save that $65 dollars. The speaker mod is my favorite anyway as it's awesome for music and movies. You guys have any complaints on this device. Let me know overall your thoughts and feedback if you don't mind.

It's loud enough that you can be on the other side of the room doing something else and still hear the person perfectly. Also it's great if your vehicle doesn't play your calls through it's speakers. Regular speaker phone can be hard to hear in your vehicle but with the speaker mod is plenty loud enough not even turned all the way up. It has other benefits too but those are just my favorite three. Grab it first. You will thoroughly enjoy that mod. I recently saw them going brand new on eBay for $49 dollars. That is a great deal compared to what you'd normally pay which is around $80. I hope you grab a couple of mods. At least a shell back.

Can't wait. Been wanting this color ever since I owned the Z Force. BTW, since then I have a while back ago went with cricket bc I test and go through a lot of devices. I briefly bought the regular Z the thinnest model in the line up and I will say it was terrible! That battery was one of the worse I've ever had. I was forced to keep my battery mod on it at all times so I couldn't enjoy my favorite which was the JBL Mod. Plus it was so thin it even felt cheap. So I've owned the Z Force which I loved but I didn't love verizon, the regular Z which was awful and I returned it and now the Z play which to me is every bit as good as the Z Force I've found but with even a better battery. The Z plays performance is plenty zippy and I've not found it to lag at all. I love the Z play and especially at the $399 price I paid it's a hard device to beat for the money. I'm going to order the JBL at the end of the week as I found them new on eBay for $49 dollars which isn't bad at all. I'll rotate my Red shell and JBL Mod out back and forth and then I already have the battery Tumi mod. I've also already got a couple of shells too left over from the Z I had. I did see a mod coming that I think is a bumper but it comes in colors. I wonder if it allows to have a shell on to use it. If so I'll pick one of those up in red too.

Spoiler Love", "thread": [{"postID": "post5667815", "text": "So after much research and debate on my next phone to replace my S7, I decided on the Z Play. I was initially going to buy one from Best Buy, but was able tofind a used Condition 9 from B&H for $320 and I got a black nylon style mod as well.\nI chose the Z Play over a 6P, G5, Honor 8 and keeping the S7 for the simple fact I enjoy \"Motorola\" and they're take on Android. It has a couple more features than straight Nexus and much more lightweight than LG or Samsung. I've owned a ton of phones but I always end up back with Motorola phones. I even still have my OG Droid, Bionic, Nexus 6, X 2014, and X Pure laying around in a drawer.\nThe first impressions of the phone were it felt solid in the hand but slippery. But overall it was excellent. After getting it setup and my information updated in it, I got to mess around with it. Coming from the S7 I enjoyed the lack of Samsung's and AT&T's bloat. It just does what I need and without a fuss. \nEverything this phone is advertised for has actually held true and impressed me so far. The first half day I didn't put much into the battery life since it came only charged with 75% juice. The next day is where I paid attention so taking it off the charger around 0630 am to start my day, I checked my notifications, some ESPN and took in some other media before I actually decided to get ready for work. I arrived at work around 0830 with about 90% left. During the day I play music, browse Imgur, watch some downloaded shows and normal messaging, email and phone calls in a building with terrible cell service I was still able to pull a bit over 3 and a half hours with 53% left on a slow day. Yesterday, same routine but when I went to bed I didn't charge the battery and just kept it going, YouTube, music, browsing, casting to my TV, messaging, email and calls. I was able to pull down 9 hrs and 16 mins with about 12% of juice left, before I charged it at about 1430. That to me is just crazy, none of the phones I used before this would have made it past 3 without needing to be placed on a charger.\nNow on to the Mods. I don't have any yet but plan on getting the JBL speaker and projector soon, but I do have the original Ash back cover and ordered the Black Herringbone Nylon cover as well. I just like the ability to swap out when I feel and with the bumper, I can still feel the textures and protect the device at the same time.\nThe only negative I have about the experience is the fact when it's on the Turbo Charger it causes the Nylon cover to warp off the top. But I easily bend it back into shape. But can get annoying.\nOverall, I see this phone staying around until the next iteration of the Z line is released.\nThanks for reading.", "time": "02-04-2017 05:53 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5669701", "text": "I just picked up the Z play for work and am impressed with the quality, my personal phone is the S7.

Chromecast is a much better protocol than Miracast. All that Miracast does is mirror your phone to your television. My experience is that it doesn't do this very well with the audio often out of sync with the video and buffering is a common problem. Chromecast works like Apple Air-Play where the video transfers from your phone and plays directly on your television. Because you are not using mirroring the quality is excellent and you can do other things on your phone while watching the video. This process also uses very little battery life. You can actually put your phone in sleep mode while you are watching the video as long as your not streaming a video that is on your phone. You also have the option to use mirroring like with Miracast for programs that don't support Chromecast directly.\nFor people that don't own a Chromecast device I understand their frustration and anger about the non-support of Miracast. There is no reason the MOTO Z can't support both protocols. Even if the MOTO Z supported Miracast, I still think it is worth the $25-$35 investment to buy a Chromecast because of its superior picture quality.", "time": "01-29-2017 11:36 AM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"postID": "post5466803", "text": "Miracast is the the facto standard for full screensharing with audio and baked into the android OS since early Android ICS days.\nit's definatly not working https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Moto-Z-...g/td-p/3385031https://m.reddit.com/r/Moto_Z/commen...g_not_working/", "time": "10-05-2016 12:22 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5466811", "text": "I don't use it so no uproar from me.

Smart TVs are another fragmented area of tech. Some early ones (from Sony IIRC) are having their YouTube apps disabled, because their hardware can't run the latest versions, so the functionality is breaking. This is part of why it's unwise to spend much (if any) extra on \"smart\" features in a TV. Better to invest in & use a good system that plugs in, like Chromecast, or XBox One / PS4, or Android TV, or Roku, etc. They too will become outdated, but they're easier & cheaper to replace than a whole smart tv.\nSo, you may be able to do both 1 and 2 with your tv, depending on what model it is and features it has. If not, it's not hard or terribly expensive to add a Chromecast or other device that will allow both with the Z Play.\nMiracast was a screen mirroring protocol. So whatever you did on your device, it showed on the screen. It's handy for some things, and I can understand where some people might use it a lot and really be frustrated not to have it. Largely the same function can be had via Chromecast, but I believe it gives Google & developers more control over blocking the casting certain apps, which have licensing issues with being projected on a large screen.

Battery life is phenomenal. I don't think I'd ever kill a battery in a day unless possibly I used it all day on max screen brightness. At home on Sunday I started using it at 5am for an hour or so, caught some more ZZs, used it another hour or so, got up, then used it a lot during the day getting things set up, apps loaded, things tuned, read a bunch online, etc etc and at after 10pm it was still at 48% battery life. The phone doesn't benchmark as fast as something like the Pixel XL but is nice and responsive. Light-years better than the S4. Screen is excellent as well. 1080P is still pretty sharp at 5.5\". 3D games would prefer more pixels and a faster phone though. Oh well, this phone isn't for FPS games.\nAs far as reception goes, I used it on the way to work today and didn't have a single hiccup in net reception through the areas that ALWAYS gave me trouble with the S4. Was today just an amazingly good reception day? Doubt it. I don't think I've ever had a day this good with the S4. I'll be able to tell a bit better if voice calls tell the same tale over the next week or so. Not a lot of those so far, but I had a 20 minute call sitting in one spot that was usually bad on my S4 with no trouble at all.\nFirst impressions? Stunningly good as a PHONE. I just wish I could've got a Moto Z Force on a plan and under warranty in Canada. Same big battery, higher specs, and bulletproof to boot. I didn't really want to pop full price for the phone up front buying it from the States and unlocking it though. Koodo had a great deal on the Z Play and data plan over the holidays. Doubled my data and am paying less than $15/month more than I usually paid/month for the S4's data plan (it's paid for) with the $15/mo Koodo Tab over 2 yrs to pay for the phone.\nIf Moto keeps this quality reception up I don't think I'd ever recommend a Samsung as a phone again. This Z Play is an actual CORDLESS PHONE, not some city-only battery sucker that is chained to a charger a few times a day.\nOne caveat in the bulletproof area- it isn't a hardened phone and there are cheap cases to fit it but I can't find an Otterbox or Life Proof case. Just about all of them are open around the Moto Mod connection area when they shouldn't be (can't use a Mod with the case on, right?), or if they block that area then the USB C connector and headphone jack are still left exposed with no rubber doors to close them like an Otterbox would have. I stick my phone in my pocket bottom-up so any dirt or rain has a straight shot to the openings. Yay...

I purchased the phone two weeks ago and never believed I was getting the same battery life that I read reviewers were getting. I would lose 30% overnight with Android System using by far the highest percentage of battery. Research led me to wipe the cache in in the bootloader, disabled the settings backup, went into safe mode, even factory reset the phone three different times. None of these solutions fixed the problem. I read about the Android 6.01 wakelock bug and I believe I had that from the get go. The phone never sleeps at night nor do I believe it went into Doze mode. There is a problem with wakelocks, and I am not even 100% sure what they are. There isn't a fix to the wakelock bug.\nBecause I had the phone less than 2 weeks, I was able to exchange it for a new one with Verizon under their return policy. Of course, since they said they could find nothing wrong with the phone and it was not truly defective, then I was to pay $35 restock fee. This is after them trying to convince me to not exchange it at all. I went round and round with them and finally was able to get them to waive the restock fee and they sent a new phone overnight. When I mentioned wakelocks was the problem, one VZ person asked me what that app was. They were completely unaware. Frustrating when I know more about Android than the repair tech.\nSo, after one night with the new phone, I lost just 2% battery overnight. I am so happy I persisted with VZ and exchanged the phone for a new one and I seem to be getting the battery life that reviewers and other users rave about. \nTo the people with the same problem that cannot exchange their phone, I could not find any fixes for this problem and I feel bad for those that are a bit stuck. Perhaps Nougat will come soon and fix things.\nVZ did say that nobody else reported this problem on this phone, so if anyone is experiencing what I did, then please report it to Verizon!

It gets a lot brighter, doesn't wash out dark areas of the picture like the T2's screen, and unless you do a lot of VR or use the phone 2 inches from your face the downgraded resolution isn't noticeable at all. As for the camera, people say it's midpack, but that's by 2016 standards. I think it's better than the T2's camera. Although photos don't come out as sharp on the Z Play (due to 16mp vs 21mp) dynamic range is way better and color reproduction is just as good. However, it pulls away in low light. While the Z Play doesn't match the S7 in terms of low light photos as they can have a fair bit of grain, they are way sharper and more bright than the T2's miserable low light photos. Additionally, you now have a manual mode, so if you're willing to do a bit of work and tweak those and the exposure settings you can tease some really nice low light shots out of the Z Play's camera.\nThe epic battery life needs no introduction, it handily destroys the T2 even with a smaller battery (thanks Snapdragon 810). 8-10 hours SOT over 1.5-2 days is the norm for me. Even under my heaviest use, I was only able to run the battery down to 60% in one day.\nI'm so glad I ditched my T2 for this phone.

I'm very familiar with Android phones-my last one used was a Note 5.\nAnyhow, my iPhone is suffering from this latest update and I am charging over 2 times a day. Blah. So I'm upgrading early.\nI am attracted to this phone due to the sick battery life, the fact it's zero dollars on my plan, and that it comes with a free JBL mod from my carrier. (I'm in Canada)\nI played around with it yesterday and it seemed a wee bit large for my hands, but nothing I can't deal with or get used to.\nI'm a power user and hate waiting for apps to load. I like a snappy interface. It's hard to tell from their demo what's real, though. Is it very responsive?\nOne thing that seems petty but drove me nuts was the font on some apps like YouTube and a few others. It seemed thick and like it had a yellow highlight around it? It was a bit hard to read. Is this an option that's configurable? I'm hoping it was just their stupid demo...\nI take a lot of photos, but if this camera is on par or better than what I used on my old iPhone 4S, I would be fine with that. \nI am trying to choose between this and the S7 Edge. I think the edges might drive me a little bonkers on the S7. Has anyone had any experience comparing both? I don't need all the fancy S7 options, but the battery and look is nice.\nLast and most important question: How is the heat on this phone? I hate phones that get really warm, and that's one reason I'm hesitant to pull the trigger on an S7-every Sammy phone I've had seems like it warms up pretty quick.\nI was hoping the Motorola runs very cool.

Battery life is awesome (two days between charging is not unreasonable - I have been using just over 50% in a full day (6am to 11pm) of constant use). The phone stays cool, and the only time I have noticed it getting a little warm is while it is plugged in and charging from a depleted battery state.

Considering fast charge is part of Qualcom's SOC, I have found that using the moto fast charge charger and an Aukey fast charge car charger that my phone charges quicker, more fully and stays cooler when charging. The staying cooler part is probably because of the stepped nature of fast charging. \nPreviously, i used a usb wireless charging card that could make the phone very hot, especially when using the phone on the wireless cradle inside the car with the screen on. Eventually the usb charging card broke. \nSince then i have been using the Auckey quick charge car charger, the phone is remarkably cooler with the screen on when used in the car. Also, the phone still charges to full with the screen on, Google maps, Google play music running. I never saw this with a \"slow\" charger or the usb wireless charging card. \nUsing the moto fast charge charger at work, the phone gets charged when it hits 30% or so. No excessive heat either. \nThis phone has a first/second gen of quick charge? I find it works much better than a \"slow\" charger. The battery seems to get a \"fuller\" charge because the charging process is stepped and the phone stays cooler. Also i have the phone in TPU case when charging. \nI'm looking forward to the MZP and hoping that what i see with my current phone only improves with the MZP.\nRegarding battery life, i haven't seen the battery life deteriorate since using fast charge.

What these companies have shown us is that, we can get decent cameras, adequate batteries, attractive screens and designs and a current OS for around $300-$400.\nThe iPhone is what it is.

Manufacturers offer their take on what works best for consumers and toss in a variety of specs, cameras, apps and services to make theirs seem better. When comparing most of the phones today, there's always a trade off and not 1 android has it all. IMO, they've reached a point where gimmicks are a selling point, (ie iris scanners).

Both stores have the phone listed for $449.99 with a release/shipping date of October 20, 2016.\nThe Motorola Moto Z Play features the new Snapdragon 625 processor and Adreno 506 GPU, with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage with a microSD card slot for storage expansion. The front features a 5MP f/2.2 wide-angle camera with flash and the rear camera is a familiar 16MP f/2.0 (see Nexus 6, third gen Moto G) with phase-detect and laser autofocus. The 5.5\" 1920x1080 screen coupled with a 3510 mAh battery brings phenomenal battery life - Motorola claims \"50 hours\". And when you need to charge, Motorola's TurboPower charging over USB-C can get you up to 9 hours of use in 15 minutes of charging.\nWith this being a Moto Z, Moto Mods are also supported. The same Style Shells, PowerPacks, projector, speaker, and camera mods that are available now for the other Moto Zs also work here with the Moto Z Play.\nWith a $450 price point, extreme battery life, decent camera, and Moto Mod expansion, the Moto Z Play makes a compelling base for \"modularity\".
