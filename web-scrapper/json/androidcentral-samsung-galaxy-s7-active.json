For some reason, once I turn off the screen by pressing the power button and then wait a little bit, if I press the Active button to bring up any chosen app, it doesn't do anything. This morning, for no reason, it worked for a few hours, but then the same problem. Other times, the screen comes up but it asks me for my fingerprint. Has anybody had these issues?\nI asked this question in the XDA forums but only one person answered and it worked for him. But seems it's so random, that I would like to get more input from you guys to see if there is something wrong with my phone.\nThis is my configuration and how to test it:\n1. Be sure that when you click the Active button it brings up an app.\n2. Go to \"Lock screen and security\" and click on \"Screen lock type\". Select a fingerprint and a secondary locking mode (Pattern, PIN or password)\n3. Go to \"Secure lock settings\" and click on \"Secured lock time\". Select the first option \"Instantly with the power key or...\"\n4. Press the Home button and then the Power key to turn it off.\n5. Wait a little bit. Sometimes it could be seconds or up to 10 minutes.\n6. Press the Active button.

I recently purchased the GS7 Active specifically to avoid worrying about damaging the device/water issues. As we all know, the water tests have recently been showing some very concerning results. More concerning than the water-proofing issues is what happened to my device last week. \nI took my phone out of my pocket and noticed what I originally though was a scratch... perhaps a hair? My brain wasn't even processing the possiblity that the middle of the screen randomly cracked for no reason. After trying to blow away the hair/wipe off the scratch/smudge I quickly realized that the impossible situation is very possible. \nI have a crack right through the top center of the screen in my brand new GS7 Active! Are you kidding me?! It's a very strange crack too, curved in the center with small perendicular cracks along the larger crack. \nI've owned a GS2, 3, 4, and 5... skipped the 6 and went for a GS7 Active. In every previous Galaxy I've owned I have never once damaged the device. I've dropped a few in my day. But never would I assume the GS7 Active would simply crack in my pocket!!! \nWorst than this, there are other reports of this happening the same exact way on the Samsung forums. \nAT&T is not being helpful at all. Trying to force me to file an insurance claim. Or send the device back to Samsung for them to repair it and send me a replacement. Ok? Great! I call Samsung, they laughed at me and said \"We don't send out replacements... you can send us the phone and we may decide to repair it in 14 business days\".\nUmmmmmm.... no! I need my phone for work. 14 business days?! It is clearly a defect with the device itself. \nWhat are my options? Now that the GS7 isn't even waterproof, and I'm now seeing evidence that the screens are cracking/fogging/smudging beyond reason... I'm hoping that Samsung steps up to the plate and fixes the device/sends us new ones or* allows for a refund/replacement.\nOtherwise, it's off to the BBB and to make sure that everyone knows not to purchase the Active product line until Samsung makes good on their advertised features.", "time": "07-11-2016 11:42 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5260219", "text": "How recently did you purchase it?

My S7 Active cracked under the glass out from the back button after it took a single tumble from 29 inches onto a wood floor that my old S4, wife's S5 Active, my former S6 Active would have taken in stride. I'm convinced that there is some manufacturing/assembly issue with the digitizer layer. The LCD panel and the outer glass are flawless. This happened 4 days after I bought it from AT&T, and neither AT&T nor Samsung was helpful in resolving the issue. AT&T would do nothing, as I didn't have insurance. (and even had I, it would have been $200 to make a claim) Samsung wouldn't provide a replacement, but would only allow me to ship the phone in to determine the problem. My phone sits in Texas with Samsung as we speak. I am awaiting their diagnosis, and I'm hoping they find their product at fault. If not I don't know what I will do, as the repairs themselves will be $100's of dollars I'm sure. I know this, though, I will not be a Samsung or AT&T customer if the issue isn't resolved, and I will do everything in my power to dissuade others from being one as well.\nIn fact, how about this.

Literally, a cracked screen when he pulled it out of his pocket. And he still didn't empathize or even attempt to escalate it. I told him that the statistical chances that him and I had the only 2 GS7 Actives that had pocket-based no-impact screen fractures was not possible. He argued me and said that \"all kinds of crazy things like this happen to him\". SMH.\nSo, yeah, I'd bet a lot of money that there is an inherent flaw with the GS7 Active.

I was sitting at a restaurant this morning and pulled the phone out of my pocket to make a quick call (it was NOT cracked), and slipped it back into my pocket a couple of minutes later (I was only talking on the phone for under two minutes). 30 minutes later, I pulled the phone out of my pocket just to Google a sports score update, and noticed that the screen had cracked at the very bottom. The crack appears to originate from what I believe is an antenna notch (there are two white notches directly underneath the S7 Edge that I'm pretty sure are related to the antenna).\nI left the restaurant and immediately called the store where I purchased it from and explained the situation. They said that the only thing they could do is have me pay $200 to have the phone replaced through insurance. I PAID $780 FOR THE DARN THING!!!!! When I said \"that's insane, I haven't even owned the phone a full two days\", they suggested that I call Samsung.\nI then called Samsung. Long story short, the rep told me that Samsung has \"temporarily placed a suspension\" on \"this type\" of repair (whatever that means), and that I needed to call Samsung back at a later date and \"try again.\" They did give me a call reference number, but I got absolutely NOWHERE with T-Mobile or Samsung.\nI have no idea what to do. I have a brand-spanking new S7 Edge that I've barely touched, and the screen just spontaneously cracked for absolutely NO reason at all.\nI did notice that the phone was getting very hot when charging via the original, OEM rapid charger that came with the phone. As someone who has worked in the technical support industry for more than 20 years (supporting mobile devices like this), I think it's a heat-related issue. Keep in mind that when the phone is charging, it's simply sitting on a table in a very cool, dry office. It was never dropped, bumped, or under ANY kind of physical pressure whatsoever during the 1 1/2 days that I've owned it so far.\nHighly upset and frustrated. I paid full carrier price ($800+ including tax) for this phone, and they're asking an addition $200 to replace it.

I do NOT recommend testing these devices at this time, even to their specified ratings, but if you must, feel free to contact me for tips or suggestions on how to do so that you have the burden of proof CLEARLY on your side.

Though i express no guarantees or warranty of compliance, i will go out of my way to ensure any testing you do will meet IP68 guidelines and stay within IP68 ratings to the best of my abilities within reason and means of consumer to consumer 'over the web' means, and that your results would be recorded accurately and reliably, to the best of my abilities and with respect to your compliance of my guidelines.\nTo be perfectly clear, we are NOT seeking compensation in any manner, simply full rectification and correction of this issue with Samsung.

I'd been using the 6 Plus for nearly 2 years so of course there was a little \"learning curve\" coming back to Android as well as retraining my muscle memory when it came to moving around on the screen and in menus, but I really like the phone & especially so since we recently got the update to Android Nougat.\nOne of the things I miss from my iPhone is that when I received a notification whether it was a phone call, text, whatever, I could just reach down and hit the volume up or down to silence it while it was in the holster on my belt. On my S7 Active it seems that isn't a luxury it has so it's a little frustrating. Even my Note 3 I had before the 6+ could do that. Where it comes in handy is when I'm on duty (public safety) and the phone goes off I could just reach down and silence it without pulling it out.\nI have tried and tried with the Active to make that happen and I'm not getting anywhere. I've even gone page by page through the menus and settings and no luck. So I'm reaching out to the collective brain trust here to see if I'm missing something or if there's another way to make this work.\nPlease accept my thanks in advance for any help you guys can provide!!", "time": "04-07-2017 10:12 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5749170", "text": "It's late...

The killer 4000mAH battery is really what sells the phone. \nThe display that AT&T is using for the S7 Active at the ATT store is pretty cool - hit a button and a clear cube, with a S7 Active inside, fills up with water. Pretty slick way of advertising the S7 Active.\nJust getting rid of the bloatware now. So far the S7 Active seems to be working with my old ATT Microcell, so that is nice (I know the S6s had issues). Whether or not it will work 100% of the time, we will see.\nAlso, for those of you that are a fan of the LED notification that all Galaxy's have had...this one at least has a blue one, not sure if its multi-color, kind of a moot point with the Always On screen notifications but still nice to have a second option.\nChris", "time": "06-10-2016 02:42 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5219283", "text": "Can you post some pics?", "time": "06-10-2016 10:00 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5219709", "text": "I went to look at them and they only had the grey in a case with water in it so I could not see the back.

Here are some of my observations after spending time in this forum:Limited Support \nDeciding to purchase a carrier exclusive device, one should realize that Samsung and AT&T allocate a minimal amount of resources to address issues with the device. I'm not saying that they ignore the device, but its not likely they have people developing, testing, updating and repairing as much as the S6 or S7 versions. I experienced this last year with addressing the \"water damage not covered under warranty.\" \nThe Marshmallow update came in late June if I recall correctly. Even with the Samsung repair center in Plano, TX it was almost certain that a repair was delayed on the S6 Active due to unavailable parts.Samsung Protection Plus \nNow this is purely speculation, but after learning a bit more about Samsung's process in terms of replacement devices, I feel a bit more educated. Carrier exclusives seem to be absent from Protection Plus. Even though the S7 Active is a big deal (and a big hit), its not there. There probably isn't a huge supply of these devices readily available. It wouldn't make sense for Samsung to make more than what AT&T wants, and I expect AT&T would return with another order if the demand was high. But certainly there is enough to support and repair based on some formula. Can Samsung not guarantee replacement Active devices can be sent out within 1-2 business days? ( The insurance is managed by an independent entity)Smaller User Base\nFor people who often dismiss screen cracking issue or water resistance issue, their argument suggest that we are only a few out of millions who own the device. Perhaps they are thinking there are the same amount of S6s or S7s exist and the problem isn't as large as we're making it out to be. On the contrary, we're a smaller group and unless someone knows the exact number of devices out there they can't make a valid point as to what is a defect or error on part of the manufacturer.", "time": "09-06-2016 08:59 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5561695", "text": "Great time for me to read this... a week AFTER a buy my S7 Active!

Then, it said verify with your Samsung Pay fingerprint - it just sat there like it had no idea what my finger was.

I usually let it sit or shut it down to cool off and then use it like normal. I have turned off fast charging capabilities especially when I am charging overnight and only occasionally use it during those random times I run out of battery at the end of the day.\nAll and all I am very happy with this phone and would recommend it to friends and family as a phone that can take a good beating. It won't win any beauty contests but if you want a more rugged phone that can withstand water, a fall and have the powerhouse of a flagship phone then this, in my opinion, is the only option.My Phone:\nBlack/Grey\nNot Rooted\nUnicorn Supcase (Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...cUvbUpU5593692 )\n120gb Mini SD from SanDisk\nAndroid 6.0.1\nRunning material design free theme from Theme Store with Google Now Launcher.", "time": "12-05-2016 10:26 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5593832", "text": "Great review TJ - Thank you! I have only had mine for a month. I come from the high end Samsung Note phones to the Active. I've had a Note 4 (Verizon), two Note 5's (one with Verizon and one with AT&T) and a Note 7 followed by a Replacement Note 7. I think the Note 7 was the most technologically enjoyable smartphone I have ever owned and I am still extremely angry at Samsung for the exploding battery issue. It seriously hurt to have to give back that (those) phone(s) as I never has a problem with either of them getting even the slightest bit warm. Anyway, on to the Active - I looked at the S7 Edge and just could not get used to holding the Edge, constantly triggering things with my fingers on the edges. My AT&T Rep said \"Hey, have you looked at the S7 Active? You always put your phones in a really rugged case that looks like a construction site phone - check this out! Once I saw the phone, the display, held it in my hand and then saw the size of the battery, I was sold... the hell with the Techno-Geek crap. Just give me a nice phone that works - and this fit the bill perfectly. I love it so far...\nI always Fast Charge and haven't had any heat issues though TJ? I also run a SuperShieldz Tempered Glass screen protector on every phone I have ever owned. They don't even usually leave the AT&T Store without one unless they're out of stock. That might have solved your smudge issue. Looks like we're also running the same case - Unicorn Beetle Supcase... that's also what I had the Note 7 in! Ugly Beast but I wanted protection not beauty!

I've never used a screen protector on any of my phones and never really had an issue. The smudge basically has gone, but now the whole screen gets oily unlike when I first purchased it, but that doesn't bother me much now since it is uniform across the whole screen now. It scared me when I read about the random cracks from just sitting in someones pocket. Luckily I have never had that issue...maybe it is the case that helps it.\nMy first Samsung device was the s6 Active and that was hands down my favorite phone. I only gave it up because a family member needed a phone and I wanted the s7 Active with the fingerprint sensor and...well it was newer.

With the EXACT same app settings, VERY similar usage, about same SOT, we see about a 30% reduction in battery life, due to the phone radio needing more power to maintain signal contact, as well as wifi signal as we have 2 repeaters to cover our house and yard (cinderblock and steel building, middle of nowhere, LTE is iffy its mostly HSUPA/HSDPA mostly, about 20% is real LTE speed/coverage).\nAverage, with no facebook/messenger, wifi on maybe 10% of the time, 8 hours SOT, GPS on 50% of the time, everything i use daily enabled, i get about 34 hours reliably to about 10%, again in the 'middle of nowhere', mostly cellular network.

I tweaked both identically utilizing app power saving, tasker, greenify, no 'always on display' unless charging, App disabler Pro, etc. Both are within an hour of eachother; probably due to differences in app utilization.\nSignal strength affects battery life considerably; where we live, 1 bar is average, 2 is in specific places, so the radio has to chew WAY more battery and work WAY harder.

You can have the new phone expedited to you in 1-2 business days for $14.95. \nAlso, they have At&t corporate warranty locations thoughout the US and these centers will hand you a repaired phone on the spot if they have them in stock.

Obviously people don't get a new car because an air bag is faulty, but the point is the manufacturer is being PRO active. In the case of a water-resistant device that is flawed, water gets inside and damages/corrodes a component.

Why even tempt the consumer or entertain the notion of taking an underwater shot if the device is water resistant and not waterproof? If one is taking under water pictures, they're most likely snorkeling or swimming in a pool. Maybe someone would take pictures of their fish, but whatever. I'll stop ranting.

Previous Galaxy devices required a cap to cover the USB slot, battery cover and other openings, to shield them from water and dust. But that additional cover caused some complaints from consumers about the added bulk and the inconvenience of attaching and detaching the cover when charging and transfering data.\nAn exclusive type of water protective tape has been applied to the front and rear glass and other parts of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, while the use of anticorrosive materials and a corrosion-preventing coating for exposed parts on the exterior ensure these Galaxy smartphones are completely protected from water.\nThe microphone needs to be able to receive sound clearly, so it is protected with portable electronics vents, which allows for a good flow of air and the outflow of humidity to prevent moisture from entering the device.Improving Processes to Get Certification\nEven with all of those advancements in the latest Galaxy models, getting the demanding IP68 certification required improved process controls, including for the management of individual parts, the systemization of the assembly process and thorough quality control.\nFinally, due to those many advances, improvements and changes made throughout the development process, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge received IP68 certification. It required relentless efforts from Samsung to make the innovations necessary to earn that rating, but the benefits of having devices well protected from dust and water made it all worthwhile.https://news.samsung.com/global/wate...galaxy-s7-edge", "time": "08-10-2016 10:29 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5313852", "text": "But that rating allows for water resistantance according to the manufacturer decision. \nBUT..

Unfortunately, Google apps will load in Safe mode, so if they're the culprit, the phone may still display the same issue even in safe mode.

Samsung informed me that my phone was being sent to AT&T to facilitate my refund. I explained to them how they have lost my loyalty, but they did not seem to care enough to throw me a bone. They forwarded me to a generic customer service AT&T number whom had no idea what I was talking about. I had to go through my story with a refund claim customer service rep who then forwarded me to someone in the warranty center. I again told my story and was told by AT&T that this is not how a refund/warranty/repair experience works. They said there is no address for Samsung to send the phone to AT&T for them to receive. I made it clear that this was not a regular situation and that they must understand the circumstances. They weren't convinced so I asked them to call Samsung themselves. They agreed and I was put on hold.\nNow they understood and were able to aid in clearing up all of this confusion. They were able to find out that Samsung was sending the phone back to me and that from there I would work with the AT&T warranty center on my claim. Oddly enough, I received an email from Samsung shortly after this phone call outlining how my phone was repaired and on its way to me.\nI questioned Samsung through Twitter DMs, as I was determined to get some clarification though whatever means necessary, of how my phone was \"magically\" repaired so \"quickly\" after I began complaining and how it \"passed\" QA when others here have not been so lucky. They apologized for the confusion and told me they would call me when they were able to clear things up. I have yet to receive a phone call.\nToday(7/25) I am expecting my LG V10 in the mail from AT&T. The Active was also on pace to arrive at my home today, but I was not present to sign off so I will have to pick it up from a UPS location tomorrow. \nThe last AT&T rep I spoke with from the warranty center said she would call me Friday(7/29) in order to facilitate my claim.

We brought it to ATT and they told me that water damage VOIDS your warranty. They would not exchange the phone even though it was less than 24 hours old. They told me to contact Samsung who wanted me to send it off to Texas for who knows how long and told me that, again, water damage VOIDS the warranty. The only way they would replace the phone is if there was a manufacture defect. I have also sent emails to the complaint department of Samsung which was no help. Now here is the only good news - The camera (which looked like yours) did clear up after keeping the phone in rice for a week. The speaker started working again - at first sounding muffled - and then getting better. Do I think the phone is in the best condition - no but at least he can use it. Here is the catch you need to be aware of- since your water resistant phone is ONLY covered for manufacture defects and since you have water damage and since they won' t be able to tell if the defects were due to the phone not being properly sealed, you are basically screwed. If Lil Wayne can advertise that he is throwing his phone in a fish tank and pouring champagne on it and the reality is that there are this many problems with the water resistance, I would say a class action lawsuit is around the corner.

On 7/26/16 I retrieved my Samsung Galaxy S7 Active and it was intact with the phone in bubble wrap and a summary of the repair information. \nA sticker with Model and IMEI information was placed on the back of the phone. \nSome of the cosmetic fixes were evident as there were no longer minor bumps or scrapes on the corners of the device that I had left it with. The water that was behind the front facing camera also appeared to be removed. Other than that I did not notice any other major differences. \nI powered the phone on, it started, and then I turned it off. I didn't care to go through any \"testing\" as I have no plan on using the device.\n7/27/16 : Attempted to get a refund from AT&T\nI went to an AT&T store with the repaired phone and all Samsung products I had previously/currently used. I told them my long story and it went straight to the manager. As I was expecting they stuck by their 14 day return policy. The store manager showed no compassion at all. I asked, \"what would you do if you were in my situation\", and she replied, \"it has not happened to me so I do not know.\" Really? This is your response. I was furious and proceeded to hand over all my Samsung phones, S2 through S4 and a wireless charging dock, reset my current phone to be wiped and asked them to set up another phone. This did not phase them and they proceeded. I asked if there was someone higher up that I could speak with and she said no. She said I should call retention and maybe they could help me.\n7/29/16 : Wait for member from warranty department to call me\nI was waiting for my scheduled call at 11:15, but I never received a call.\n7/30/16 : Called retention customer service\nTold them my entire life story.\nThis representative again noted that they cannot do refunds as I did not purchase the phone online or over the phone. They said I must go to the store to do this. They said if they would not do a refund that I should ask for the regional manager. The rep said store managers must provide this information upon request. \nI proceeded to the store, did the above and was given a direct report contact who was not a regional manager. I called retention while I was in the store and they spoke with the manager in the store. Still no regional manager. This rep said their supervisor would call me back to see if I could help with my issue. I left the store with the store managers card and his direct report. I left a voicemail and an email for this individual at that time.\nThe retention supervisor called me back told me the same story. No refunds through the phone.\nThat evening I called the warranty center, as I never received a call from them on Friday, and they were much more compassionate. There are certain departments that seem to handle this much better than others, or maybe just certain people. The rep I spoke with was cordial and understanding. He helped me set up a warranty claim and a replacement phone is being sent to me. I did this because my perception of the repaired phone I have has been damaged. If I must have this device, pending I don't get a refund, I would like to be a little more ensured that the phone I have is new and not damaged from being torn a part and pieced back together. The warranty rep said I could do this alongside my escalation claim that I am attempting to go through with the store managers. I simply either send back my current device and keep the new one, or I place the return shipping label on the new device (if I get a refund on my current device) and send back.\nI'm anticipating I should have a resolution on this issue by the end of the week.

GF had an older Android and iPhone 6 for work; folks had an S3; now S7 Active. None of them care about root/ROM/tweaking etc; all they care about is stability, usefulness, camera, and battery life.\nI have ALWAYS screwed with my phones (...and cars, computers, cameras, bikes; anything really); this is the first one that out of the box i was happy with. Yeah, i tweaked it, but its been very impressive, even totally stock. We've soaked ours with no issues, repeatedly. GF and folks love theirs; even my dad, and he DESPISES technology.\nTechnical camera review/synopsis below.\nS7, S7 Edge, and S7 Active cameras have comparable OIS (optical stabilization) to lense stabilization found within the venerable $700 Nikon 18-200 VR f3.5-5.6 (Mk-II) and $650 Nikon VR 70-300 f4-5.6 with VR (Vibration Reduction, same thing as OIS). Thing is, with Nikon and Canon DSLR's, you have to buy specific optically stabilized lenses (typically zoom lenses), with the S7 series, its built in and always active. Granted, it has no optical zoom or interchangeable lenses (but its a fixed lens camera... on a PHONE...). Also, in RAW+Jpeg mode (available in Pro mode in Camera app), 12.5 stops of DR at ISO 400 which is comparable to the 2009 Nikon D300 pro/prosumer DSLR i drag around with me daily that was $1700 new, also at 400 ISO. I built a business and a career around that camera as well as ancient Canon XH-A1 tape-based HD footage. And i can now replicate the same results, with a MOBILE PHONE. Thats pretty impressive. AF tracking works JUST as well as the Nikon MultiCAM AF-3500DX in my 'drug-everywhere' Nikon D300 pro/prosumer DSLR with 51 point AF 3D tracking, and with a wider spectrum of available focus and focus tracking points. WORLDS better than the XH-A1 videocams i shot with, equipped with 35mm adapters, SLR lenses, etc etc. \nAlso, D300 is 12.3mp; S7 series is 12mp... Same difference. In RAW there is no sharpening or added BS; just raw data recorded, and i can view/edit them lightly in Adobe Lightroom on the fly, export as jpeg etc.\nFor what it is, it works incredibly well. For what it isn't, i can't complain; i have a D300 and D4s and a bag of crazy expensive lenses, as well as Blackmagic Design cameras that shoot RAW video and accept my Nikon lenses and OIS Panasonic Lumix 12-25 f2.8 lens that i use for work or whenever i want.\nWith such a tiny sensor, the perspective is always way off, i have basically no depth of field to play with, zoom is a total joke as its digital, and creatively i cannot get any distant shots remotely close to how i would like them, but thats a physical limitation. It also allows me to take RAW shots in places and circumstances i would not DARE risk taking $1400-$5000 worth of camera/lens combo's for a quick candid shot, so for that its awesome; lets me take shots i would otherwise have passed up so as not to risk expensive gear, and i have the same fidelity as a pro/prosumer SLR. And its a PHONE, that within its limitations, competes with a flagship DSLR (albeit from years past) with ease.\nI would NEVER take any of my DSLR's, m4/3 RAW Blackmagic Design bodies that shoot RAW digital film (no phone shoots RAW video, YET...), or expensive lenses to the places ive already taken the S7 Active.\nFor me, its been great; dunked it, bonked it, swam with it, flipped my kayak with it, filmed under and over water with it; bitrate in video and fidelity in HDR is close enough to old AVCHD and HDV tapes (analog compressed vs digital compressed), and most of all, i am unafraid to USE it in places i would NEVER risk my precious work gear.", "time": "07-29-2016 11:18 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Is there a way to buy the S7 Active without a plan?", "thread": [{"postID": "post5250839", "text": "Hey gang, \nI want to buy this phone outright, unlock it and drop my tmobile sim in it.

Obviously, this becomes an issue when sending it in again for warranty service or even more so, reselling the device. \nWhen I received my S6 Active back from having the screen replaced, I experienced water damage. I found a S6 Active \"teardown\" video on YouTube showing how the screen is disassembled. What they do is heat up the front of the device so the adhesive loosens the screen. I imagine the reverse process for resealing the device is to apply more adhesive or reheat the existing adhesive again to soften it.\nI am convinced that these devices were never intended to be opened which ,to me, is why 1. Parts are limited 2.There is no Samsung Protection Plus 3. Their original warranty did not cover water damage. Furthermore, what kind of QA testing can they do on a waterproof phone?

Frankly i was disappointed in what they showed vs what they had to say.\nFirstly, they did toss the device about, then proceed to test it. CR then used a pressurized air/water chamber test vs depth test; air compresses much more evenly; water does not compress as such, but pressure increases with weight as a function of depth (assuming gravity is present). A 1.5m (or more) clear tube filled with clean fresh water would have been the proper way to test design specifications.\nSecondly, no time lapse, single shot was performed (or at least shown); this would further prove their point; instead its a cutaway.\nThirdly, lack of standardization in testing; typically some adherence to STP laws (standard temperature and pressure, or deviations thereof) are used in a truly scientific study.\nFourthly, no concurrent test with 'passing' S7 and S7 Edge in the same chamber at the same time (and their videos on the S7 and S7 Edge show the same glaring faults in their method vs scientific, standardized testing methods for ANY ratings).\nAnd lastly, no static timer (a glorified clock) present that is clearly visible, which combined with the above methods, would clearly indicate either a passing or failing grade in the hardware.\nI'm not saying i dont trust their results, but i am saying my 6th grade science teacher would have flunked them immediately, and for such a large organization that purports to represent consumers, i was appalled at the lack of professionalism, and the suggested 'scientific' manner in which the test was conducted, which was deplorably not scientific nor standardized in any means whatsoever.\nI have conducted more scientific tests on used spark plugs to analyze lubrication effects vs carbon deposit efficiency on various spark plugs for my RX-7's and RX-8's, accounted for and adjusted for variables far more accurately than CR; let alone DAYS of testing sensors and lenses for various camera systems and issues such as 'jello'/CMOS line read speeds, dynamic range, ISO noise vs sensitivity, etc etc, and i am not a scientist by any means.", "time": "07-17-2016 12:14 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5269665", "text": "I get that you feel that CR's test were unscientific and non standard.

Everything has pretty well been summed up by Phil's excellent review on Android Central. Just a couple of my personal observations: I really like the phone. It is the first phone that will let me get through an entire day and more without charging. That is the main and compelling reason I bought the phone, not necessarily for the ruggedness, but for the battery. I tried a case and it makes the phone too heavy so i took it off and will do without. One review I read said that the screen of the Active attracts dust more so than other phones. I found that true and carry a micro fiber cloth in my back pocket so not really a problem. As already noted, it's basically an S7 in a rugged case with tactile buttons so there are no surprises here. Everything works as it should and I haven't found anything to complain about or dislike. I saved the screen for last. If you watched the video in another thread on this forum, you are now aware of the plastic coating that makes the screen easy to scratch. I tried a protector, but couldn't resolve some spot issues so removed it. I might try another brand. One person asked what happens to the waterproofing if you apply a protector, i.e., can water get in between the screen protector and the screen? Good question and I don't know the answer.

I bought the phone a couple weeks ago and love it. Most everything has been covered in reviews so this is going to deal with the screen and protectors. As you all know the screen will scratch very very easily. A samsung rep I spoke to basically said they know and it is what it is. So before I took the at&t plastic off I went to an at&t store (bought my phone from best buy) and got a screen protector. At the time they only had the bodyguardz. I took it home and put it on but there were dozens of air bubbles. I let it sit for 48 hours and they didnt go away. I went back to at&t and they tried to install one and it wouldnt stay seated in the corner. He tried a 3rd one and it seated but again air bubbles. A few days later at&t got zagg screens in so I went and exchanged the bodyguardz and took the zagg home. First try the zagg went on flawlessly. There are zero air bubbles and it adhered perfectly. It even gave a bit more clarity to the screen. So if your going to put a tempered glass screen on get a zagg. I also have a supershieldz at home for when I break the zagg I can have a backup while I wait for my $5 replacement.\nAs far as water goes while using a screen protector. The bodyguardz will allow water to sit behind the glass because they dont adhere properly. The zagg however allows absolutely no water. My kid plays softball a few times a week and after each game I have to dunk my phone in tap water to remove all the dust. After taking a towel to it there is absolutely no water under the screen. \nWhich brings me to my one minor complaint. Dust and junk gets caught between the screen and the rubber shell and it drives me nuts. I have to use a piece of paper to get in there and clean it out when it happens.\nBattery life is amazing, Ive been off the charger for 1 day and 2 hours with just shy of 5 hours SOT and 44% battery left. I should hit almost 8 hours of SOT. I do turn location off unless I need it though.\nHope that helps someone make a decision on what I consider an absolutely amazing phone.", "time": "06-30-2016 05:18 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5247328", "text": "Thanks for the info", "time": "07-01-2016 10:09 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5247422", "text": "I have had my camp green about 8 days.

Coming from Galaxy S4 with 5200mah battery heavily tweaked for battery life, custom OS, etc.\nOVERALL - This is the first 'no compromise' Active device, that has all the bells and whistles of the flagship S7/S7 Edge (minus S7 Edge 'Edge Screen features which i find pointless) and a bigger battery too; I love it. I feel no need to modify the OS in any way that would require root, or a 'compromised' bootloader. Get a glass screen protector ASAP; the polycarbonate screen cover will scratch easily, and maybe a very thin/slim TPU case for better grip and added safety in case of drops; they are cheap anyways; might as well for an $800 phone. Plastic and rubber sides and back mean no back glass cracking or breaking; my main concern with S7 and S7 Edge. Apple did away with glass backs and went to aluminum, chances are samsung will follow suit in a generation or two.\nBOTTOM LINE - Get it, try it, use it, if you don't absolutely love it, take it back on the 13th or 14th day. Battery life is awesome, camera is wonderful, and its basically a Galaxy S7 with a case and larger battery that's far more worry free. Frankly, if you like the S7 or you are clumsy; get the Active. If you have kids, get the Active. If you prefer the Edge for its Edge Screen features, get the S7 Edge (and a case...). The Active makes the S7 somewhat redundant if you have AT&T. I bought 2 initially; one for myself (from an S4 with 5200mah Anker battery/case) and my GF; then bought another for my folks with an ancient Galaxy S3 (also on AT&T). First off, let it get used to your usage for a few days; app power saving lets you choose 'auto' or 'always' save power; i lean heavily towards 'always' save power. I installed Greenify and tweaked it for more battery life control, as well as App Killer Pro (Samsung) to disable AT&T bloatware and other misc stuff i wont use (Gear/Gear VR stuff, Facebook which i am not a member of, DirectTV, AT&T stuff). I also installed, but did not yet create any profiles with Tasker as well but that's a bit more in-depth.\nDurability - A bit slippery out of the box (not as slippery as iPhones, S7, and S7 Edge); i bought an $8 TPU case on Amazon as well as a cheap glass screen protector to keep the polycarbonate screen protected from scratches; also $8 Amazon purchase. Held up to multiple water dunks while swimming and kayaking just fine. I wash it off regularly with mild hand soap and tap water, or windex and water, taking off the TPU case and wiping it dry then blowing water out of the charge and headphone ports and speaker; its seen dunks of at least 3 feet as well as left in my pocket whilst flipping my kayak or swimming and dragging my kayak out of lakes and creeks. Zero issues there.\nFeatures - Activity Zone is useful if you hike/bike/kayak/actually ie DO stuff, S Health is useful as well if you track any of your stats as i do. You can program the button to launch 3 different apps to your liking. Camera is amazing (see below). Accepts and works with up to 200GB MicroSD cards (tested SanDisk 64GB/128GB/200GB UHS1 cards; haven't tested a 256GB yet), so storage isn't an issue. Fingerprint scanner is just as reliable as iPhone 6s/Plus and S7/S7 Edge in my experience.\nSoftware - Excellent; Marshmallow 6.0.1 out of the box works great and really needs no tweaks, but i still use Tasker, Greenify, and App Killer Pro to extend battery life and disable features i wont use. Facebook app sucks down a lot of power; i dont use facebook (or any social networking, so that may affect your battery life) so I disabled it and its two reliant services with App Killer Pro as well as DirectTV and AT&T bloatware. First phone i don't feel the need to Root and ROM; i expected lag, stutter, and to end up returning it. While i still love my S4 with 5200mah battery, the S7 Active easily bests it and is more livable; faster and smaller 4000mah battery lasts longer, with less tweaks/customization needed.\nPerformance/Battery - Right up there with S7/S7 Edge in performance; specs are identical. Battery (FAR better than S7, and still better than S7 Edge) lasts 2 days easily; 44hrs (barely) 100%-1% with 8hrs (also barely) screen on time, GPS, NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi on occasion (WiFi saves battery vs LTE), with egregious usage of Camera and Google Maps and everything syncing whenever. Fast Charging and Fast Wireless Charging (Samsung Fast Wireless Charger) have it from 10% to 100% in about 2hrs 40 minutes. I Average 40 hours with 8 hours screen time with GPS, NFC, Bluetooth, and some WiFi usage in areas i get 2 bars of reception (low reception increases battery consumption; good reception and WiFi decrease battery usage). I try to use only the wireless charger so as not to wiggle/damage the USB port (S4 USB port died on me once), works flawlessly even with a TPU case on it. TPU case also only decreases signal by approximately 1-4dB, averaging closer to 2dB, and signal strength vs friends AT&T S7 Edge is on average 0.7dB lower vs S7 Edge with both naked, and 1.3dB lower with S7 Active in TPU case vs S7 Edge with no case. Both with TPU cases, or both naked, the signal dB difference is statistically negligible.\nCamera - Second to none in mobiles from what i've played with; shoots RAW upon demand, OIS is ALWAYS on, HDR, etc. Flash is not bluish; its approx. 3600k (Kelvin), so a nice, clean, natural white. More options than you'll use, but clean layout. Pro mode RAW is impressive at 12-12.5 stops of DR (by my comparisons and tests); I film and photograph in RAW exclusively, professionally, and while this is nowhere near the caliber of some of the top performers i use in the pro world (at several to tens of thousands for a body PLUS lenses), for a mobile it is VERY impressive indeed, especially with having real OIS, which is Optical Image Stabilization, which in most the RAW film cameras i use, is non-existent or unavailable, and it REALLY works well, just as good as Nikon VR and Canon IS (their branded names for Optical Image Stabilization but is only built into certain lenses and none that i use regularly; this is the same tech...And it WORKS). AF tracking works as good as Nikon AF 3D tracking, and just as good in Video mode (but in 1080P mode only). Its also f1.7 aperture, and while the tiny sensor doesn't allow for very shallow DSLR depth of field, coupled with Always-On OIS it DOES allow for VERY sharp, nearly noise free low light shots. Jello is minimal for a CMOS sensor; very fast CMOS scan speeds, although clearly not a global shutter sensor.\nConclusion - Highly impressed and pretty surprised; If you're on the fence, try it.

The efficiency of the water resistant depends on many factors. We would be very cautious around water, even though they are water resistant. It is important to remember that these are still electronic devices and water can damage them. Water damage is not covered under warranty. I hope that helps. ^Les\nMe: Wait a second... now you have displays in the AT&T stores where people can submerge these phones and you brag about the phone being water resistant for 30 mins at 5 ft. Have you seen the consumer reports article/video in question? It duplicates this scenario. Nothing extreme. And both phones they tested got screen problems and water in their cameras. The regular S7 and Edge passed the same test with flying colors. This needs to be addressed or you are going to have a lot of b unhappy customers.

They issued a recall and the updated variant passed CR's test. \nNow, I'm not saying Samsung should suspend sales of the S7A, because this isn't really a safety issue in general, but they should really do something that benefits the consumers in response, like warranty replacements for water damage and future models getting a minor internal redesign, like how the S Pen slot on the Note 5 got a minor redesign after people got the S Pen stuck in it when put backwards.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "07-09-2016 12:36 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5257691", "text": "Good thing AC doesn't review cars, or AC's response would be the failed test means \"nothing.\" AC drove it's Lexus-provided review car around town without a problem.

Not that i doubt their good intentions, and i am not defending Samsung, BUT if you intend to conduct a test of a product, and intend to be perceived as a credible source, then scientifically reproduceable standards and procedures should be followed.\nPlease be aware that to properly test ANY device, ALL of the following criterion SHOULD be met to ensure correct scientific testing methods. Frankly i was disappointed in what they showed vs what they had to say.\nFirstly, they used a pressurized chamber test vs depth test; air compresses much more evenly; water does not compress as such, but pressure increases with weight as a function of depth (assuming gravity is present). A 1.5m (or more) clear tube filled with clean fresh water would have been the proper way to test design specifications.\nSecondly, no time lapse, single shot was performed (or at least shown); this would further prove their point; instead its a cutaway.\nThirdly, lack of standardization in testing; typically some adherence to STP laws (standard temperature and pressure, or deviations thereof) are used in a truly scientific study.\nFourthly, no concurrent test with 'passing' S7 and S7 Edge in the same chamber at the same time (and their videos on the S7 and S7 Edge show the same glaring faults in the scientific method).\nAnd lastly, no static timer present that is clearly visible, which combined with the above methods, would clearly indicate either a passing or failing grade in the hardware.\nI'm not saying i dont trust their results, but i am saying my 6th grade science teacher would have flunked them immediately, and for such a large organization that purports to represent consumers, i was appalled at the lack of professionalism, and the suggested 'scientific' manner in which the test was conducted.\nI have conducted more scientific tests on used spark plugs to analyze lubrication effects vs carbon deposit efficiency on various spark plugs for my RX-7's and RX-8's, accounted for and adjusted for variables far more accurately than CR; let alone DAYS of testing sensors and lenses for various camera systems and issues such as 'jello'/CMOS line read speeds, dynamic range, ISO noise vs sensitivity, etc etc, and i am not a scientist by any means.", "time": "07-14-2016 10:32 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5266281", "text": "Editors' note (July 10, 2016): Consumer Reports has stated the Galaxy S7 Active failed that publication's waterproofing tests.

I suggested they do the same test with two different ways.

Then do the same test in the pressurized dunk tank they used and monitor for fail. The big thing I would like to see is a tear down report stating how the water got in and at what point, to which they said they liked the idea and would bring it up to the testers. I spoke with an AT&T rep they said the logs they have show the power port is the weak spot on the phone, so AT&T knows there is an issue as well.

But I love the camera on the regular S7, as long as everything is still (especially in mid/low lighting).

You can notice that with Flash in Auto Mode and that you'll get bright pictures and the flash will fire up less often. However, this isn't ideal for moving subjects, since they will blur a bit if the lens is 'open' for too long. This is where Pro mode comes in, where you can tweak the aperture and exposure times, or you may use Sports mode, but that will make any low-light picture almost pitch black.", "time": "06-08-2016 12:17 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Rumors, anyone?", "thread": [{"postID": "post5206609", "text": "What does everyone think about the rumors of an active?
