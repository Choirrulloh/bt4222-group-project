[{"title": "Bluetooth Volume issue since Nougat update", "thread": [{"postID": "post5783654", "text": "Hi,\nI am new here and was unable to find anything on this so if it has been asked please excuse the duplication. I have an S6 Edge Plus and I just recently updated to Nougat (7.0). Every since then I have not been able to adjust the Bluetooth volume when I am connect to my car stereo to use my phone. When I try to increase the volume it wont go higher than about half way (level 15 on my stereo). When I try to turn it up it automatically decreases back to the half way point. This is only when I use the phone, it does not affect the volume control for the MP3 player and it only does it in my car. I have tried volume lockers and various Bluetooth Volume controls and no luck. Has anyone else had this happen? Any ideas on how to fix it or override it?", "time": "04-25-2017 10:12 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5808354", "text": "I have this same issue -- with an S6 Edge (not the Plus). My stereo is a Kenwood (KMM-BT515HD). I plan to do a firmware update to the stereo (just noticed they released one a few months ago), but my last issue with this phone and stereo was a problem with call waiting and audio distortion (if a call came in while I was on a call, neither call was intelligible) and that actually got resolved by the Nougat update. So, I suspect this issue is a problem with the phone and not the stereo.\nOh, and I have found that if someone calls me (and I haven't initiated the call), then I can adjust the volume.

That's the real question. \nI certainly don't want to have to type in 100+(100*(10/100)) or even 100+10%*100 when I could just type in as David did and what most people do. Who gives a **** if it's not mathematically correct as typed into your calculator? Somehow I doubt anyone who cares so much about maths would be even trying to use the % button on a calculator.\nEldoradoSan, you mustn't hang around many people who calculate percentages regularly. While you may not have 'seen anyone attempt math like this before' I don't know many who wouldn't. Most people worked out, or were taught, what the % button an a calculator actually does and it saved them heaps of time. Aparently Android doesn't like that convention any more and prefers instead to be inconvenient. Maybe they don't even know it's an issue.\nLinds", "time": "03-30-2016 06:28 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5094347", "text": "Well, Linds, you're certainly right on one point. My friends and I don't sit around calculating percentages and comparing the results from our differing calculators and methods.\nHere's the problem, though. There is no standard, nor will there ever likely be, for the percentage button on calculators. But I guess I'm just an oddball. I don't use a calculator to figure percentages. I'm mathematically sound enough to know all I have to do is move the little decimal point to get 10%. Because lets be honest here, there are really only a couple of reasons to even figure a percentage: finding a tip amount or how much tax we are going to pay on an item. And I'd bet most people don't even do the latter. \nSo, if people want to rely on unsound methods when it comes to their money, good for them. I'm not one of those people.

I challenge you to find a calculator (not a phone app) that wouldn't give 110 when you type in 100+10%. \nI'm exactly the same when figuring out what 10% of something is. I don't have to use the % button. But it's different when adding or subtracting a percentage to a number. I'm sure most people would only do this once in a blue moon. But I do it daily. I'm in retail. I'm constantly figuring out markups and the like. I used to often use my phone to do such when I was away from my desk. But now it's just a pain in the ***. It's not so bad to do it in your head when it's adding 10% but I don't really want to do something like 56.98-23% in my head. It's not an unsound method when you know your calculator works that way. David was using the \"right way\" for a standard calculator. If I wanted to do everything long hand I'd use a pen and paper. After all, they were invented to make things easier. \nOne soon realises when a calculator works differently like David did. We're not blindly following some random method and taking whatever pops up on the screen. We just want it to work like normal. That's why I looked this up.

I wasn't very clear, I meant a run of the mill calculator you could buy at any supermarket or office supply shop. Just like the blog post was talking about. I suppose the only way the % function makes anything better is because it removes the 'in your head' part of the equation. So yes, it's unnecessary, but it is convenient. Sure, and I'm not knocking your method in the slightest. I'm just saying it's what people are used to doing with an everyday calculator and it does work every time on an every day calculator. It suits people that don't think like a mathematician. Yes, it's sad and it doesn't stop at maths. I get frustrated when people don't know how to sew or use 'to' and 'too' correctly. However, I know that I used to work out all percentage calculations without using the % button. It's just convenience and laziness. But since I learned what the % key does I've been using it because it's easier. Our brains work like that, they are inherently lazy. Kind of like picking up a calculator in the first place. I don't need it for most calculations, I'm just lazy and slow at maths. \nSo since people who don't need/want a % button (like yourself) don't use it, why on earth should it have a function like what the latest version of android and windows calculators have and stuff around the people it was created for? Is it just to be an ***, or is there a real reason? If there is some reason then I'm ok with it. But like I asked in the beginning. Why would anyone want it to have the function /100?

Simply toggle the ones you don't want running in the background. I would recommend toggling off Facebook but not Facebook messenger (if you use it actively) as messengers and email services do require background data in order to receive push notifications.\nLike others have said here, typical users can get between 4 to 5 hours of on screen time, 2ish is very low in comparison. I myself have been able to squeeze out almost 6 hours of on screen time but this does not include GPS navigation. GPS is a real battery drainer when left unchecked, even if you're not using maps, a lot of apps like to use GPS in the background, I would check which apps have been using your location services as well if I were you.

I was super excited about it when I first got it back in Aug 2015. Then the S7 Edge was released, and effectively killed what the S6 Edge + was supposed to be. Why Samsung released what was basically the successor for the phone six months after its release, still irks me to no end. All of my friends switched to the S7 edge and I was stuck with my S6 Edge + without its always on display and lack of water proofing. But, I kept on, enjoyed the extra screen real estate, and once it got 6.0, all was fine with the world. \nUntil a couple of weeks ago. I noticed some of my chargers weren't working like they were supposed to; wobbling to and fro, skipping in and out of charging, and not charging as quickly as they once had. I'd switch the cable, and it'd work as it was supposed to. Weird, but whatever. Then the cables I switched started doing the same. Definitely odd. There was no stress placed on the cables while plugged in (and most of the time when I charged, it was via wireless charging while I slept). Then tonight all heck broke loose. I placed my phone on the wireless charger as usual, but instead of going to bed, I went back to my living room to watch some TV. I kept hearing a beeping noise, I couldn't place. Mute the TV, hear it faintly, but then it stopped. Repeat. Finally figured it was my phone making the \"now charging\" beeps over and over again. I figured I had just not placed it centered on the dock and went to reposition. This is where I figured out I was in for a night full of aggravation. I took the phone off the wireless charger, and it kept beeping! >.< \nSo now I have to go tomorrow (luckily a day off work) and see if VZW will replace it, but I'll likely still have to pay the $100 deductible or whatever they wish to call it. Or try to go to a local \"repair\" shop to see if they can fix the charging port. OR pay off the remaining balance ($400) and try to trade it in on a new phone. I'm over it. I want a new phone. I don't want to sink any more money into this phone than I have to. I'm highly disappointed that I have been so let down by a phone that I shouldn't be having any problems with (it's a $900 phone that I've had for little over a year, always in a case, with a screen protector).

I can't use my Microsoft Band 2 on my Nexus 6P because the Microsoft Health app stops my phone from being able to pair with anything else Bluetooth wise, and I discovered this by booting into safe mode, finding that Bluetooth pairing worked fine, then looking at the most recent apps I had installed and trying to uninstall one by one until it worked again.\nSo my question for you is - after you did the hard reset, did you recover back to your phone with all of the apps you had on it before? If so, it's likely an app. So go to the Google Play Store on your phone, and select My Apps. You'll see them in the order of last updated and then last installed.\nSee if any of them may be more obviously connected to your phone. Anything with caller ID like Sync.me, or Google Voice or even some antivirus software that has that as an addon would be the first place I'd look.\nBest of luck.\nTamir\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "02-21-2016 02:32 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5009038", "text": "I uninstalled the White Pages ID app from my phone.

Initially I wasn't too devastated because I knew that I had my phone set up to have all pictures and videos backed up to Google Drive. You can imagine my surprise when I logged in to Google Drive only to discover that none of my pictures and videos were there. In fact, it appears that nothing has been saving from before the day that I activated this phone (Sept. 13th). Over two months of data cannot be found. I find that to be so strange, because when I periodically checked, I saw my pictures in Google Drive. Chats with Verizon, Google, and Samsung reps have been useless. A Verizon rep even told me that this has happened to all sorts of devices and there is 'no rhyme or reason for it'. She assured me that she's never seen it happen to a phone twice. That's comforting. After searching online, I noticed that others who have experienced this have blamed the recent software update for causing the reset. I'm curious whether another else has experienced this. The consensus is that my data is lost forever and there's 'no way' to retrieve it. A friend even tried to use some recovery software but that didn't work.

Sound goes to the TV, and gets muted on the phone:\n- Actiontec ScreenBeam Mini 2 - plugs into HDMI port, plus it needs USB power, which I get from my TV's USB port, using the included USB extension cord.\n- ScreenBeam Utility app - allows you to update the Mini 2's firmware, and also make config changes (I changed nothing, just used the defaults).\n- (optional) Miracast Widget & Shortcut - Use this to connect quickly. For some reason, I could not connect after the first time using the standard way (Swipe down --> down arrow on upper right --> EDIT upper right just to the left of up arrow --> Smart View). So now I always use this widget to connect, making for just a few steps (Switch TV input to that HDMI port, power the Mini 2, TV screen says \"ready to connect\" or similar, then I tap this widget et voila, a mirrored phone, which plays video flawlessly in my few tests.\nUnfortunately, I don't recall whether I initially connected using Samsung's Quick Connect or not. I've only used this setup a couple of times at a beach house, and I'm not there now to test and learn better how it all works (Quick Connect vs. EDIT/Smart View vs. Miracast widget).", "time": "07-03-2016 01:55 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Rberger1", "thread": [{"postID": "post5248350", "text": "How do I remove the applock from my s6?", "time": "07-02-2016 04:03 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5249245", "text": "Welcome to Android Central!

I think it was on sale or clearance or something cause I could swear it was $60 or so last weak.... it's pretty cool IMO.

Plus, it has auto sleep/wake functionality... It also seems like it will be easy to.get on and off. \nOne downside to the S-View Flip Cover is it is a fingerprint magnet.

You're moving to a new OS that handles things differently. And, every phone is different. To give an example, I absolutely hate TouchWiz (Samsung's launcher). Instead, I use Action Launcher 3.

On days of heavy usage, I might have to top off, but I've got a quick car charger and quick charger wall plug so it doesn't take long.

Can't see this on Android lock screen - only a couple tiles then you have to click and scroll around.\n2) email account management - WP lets you have separate tiles for each email account. Each tile will show you how many new mails since you last checked. Google lumps them all together. You can filter by one account or another but the \"new messages\" number is a combined number or default account number and no way to see new messages. Worst than that, the number on the icon isn't new since last checked, it's all unread emails. So my number keeps going up and up and I never know if I've gotten new emails or not\n3) browsing long lists - WP standard of organizing lists in to alpha, allowing you to browse easily clicking on alphabetical tiles is simple and easy. Prime example - music. I have 1000's of songs in my collection. When I browse by artist I click on the letter the artist starts with, get there quickly. Great UI when you use your phone for music while driving. Google play is one long list of artists that you have to scroll and scroll through. Alternative is search which requires you to type, or voice search, which I've found plays stuff from the google play online collection, often not what you want to hear.\n4) toast notifications - WP are consistent, at the top of the screen, whether on lock screen or not. Click and you get to view the message or post etc. Haven't figured out Androids at all... \n5) Battery life - more hw specfic but I\"ve spent hours trying to find out how to optimize batter life. Have galaxy s6 128 GB. I'm using standard launcher for now. First attempt to optimize I might have got 6 hours before having to plugin. This morning after two minutes of browsing I lost 3% of life. I've done further optimization after combing through wads of settings. It's a bit better so far but not sure how much I've crippled the phone (or why I have to go through so much effort). This is supposed to be one of the best phones on the market.\n6) Home customization, app navigation - WP is simple, does everything you need, very usable. Tiles display info, you can resize based on level of importance. Apps not on the start screen are in an easy to navigate list, using the alpha tiles just like music (and all WP lists). Android is basically an iOS copy. A bunch of icons you put on different cards you swipe to, none differentiated from other , other than icon design. Then there's a list of all apps which is again, just a list of icons on cards that you swipe, no way to easily navigate to apps that begin with S.. forced to use search. Customizing is cumbersome, often resulting in icons being bundled into groups when you didn't mean to. There's a giant search bar on the screen which does nothing but launch an app - why not just give an icon (or use the phone button like WP)\n7) Browsing through open apps. WP let's you preview the full screen of open apps while you browse. Android stacks cards and you can't see information on them unless you select. There is a split screen feature which will help solve this, but haven't figured it out yet\n8) Customizing the quick settings in the pull down... not sure how to do this in Android, but in WP I put those settings I toggled most in my quick swipe from top.\n9) Swipe typing - waaaay more accurate in WP. Android is wrong most of the time and the suggestions aren't even close. Thumb typing on android might be a bit better.\n10) Settings - confusing massive list buried in hierarchy of categories. Only way to find most stuff in settings is to first google online, then use Search in settings to find it. WP has a list of at most 20 settings groups which are easy to scroll through and find. (never understood though why WP settings weren't in alpha order with alpha tile navigation but it was short enough)\n11) Facebook photo upload - can't believe this is the case but if you take a portrait photo, it uploads it sideways into facebook unless you catch it and rotate before upload. Such a common use case, can't believe you have to do this. If you accidentally upload it in this sideways fashion, you can't use the app to fix it. You have to go online.\nthat's what I remember I posted for now... will post more as I find. Note there's a great customization called Launcher 8 that makes it work just like a WP.

Find a good Google now hands free launcher, even with the issues it is still needed.\n2. Check out some of the apps for places you frequent (like restaurants). There are some sweet discounts there.\n3. Until you really learn the system, don't mess too much with launchers, it will just muck up the learning process.\n4. Be patient. The android OS while powerful has a real major learning curve requirement. In the ends the benefits outweigh the cons.\n5. Do install the Office products it will help smooth the transition.\n6. If you are on ATT use the contact mover tool. It works well.\n7. Keep your old phone for text message reference and forward yourself text messages you need to keep.\n8. It can sometimes be hard to get answers to issues (probably due to how large the community is), don't get frustrated, there can be resources out there to find them, and your friends may have answers. As I don't really know many people on Android (do to the area I work in), it has been a little more difficult).\nThe good:\n1.

The modern Androids are responsive.\n4. Fingerprint scanner unlock is nice.\n5. Navigation apps are incredible.\n6. Voice to text accuracy is pretty darn good.

This does not diminish my stand to stay with Android over Windows Phone, but just issues I would like to one day solve. As I learn how things work I may write tools to fix these.\n1. Wifi is easy to setup but whatever I set as a favorite or \"My connections\" becomes disabled when I go out of range. This is a real pain but I have learned to live with it.\n2. Voice (Hands free) does not work out of the box, you have to have an app, that connects. EG BT to GN for pressing a button to launch google now.\n3. Finding names in the list of contacts, for some reason it has a hard time finding names, or it changes. I have not found a way to setup nicknames.\n4. Battery life has been lower on the Android than on my 1520 Windows phone running Windows 10 10586.29, this is not the end of the world as it does last most of the day and is still good when I get home. Battery save does work well though when you get low.\n5. There is a limit to what contacts you can link and for whatever reason Android has created a lot of duplicate variations for the numerous apps.\n6. Apps do mess with your contacts. This is an annoyance but it does not seem to replace a contact, although it make replace the tag name.\n7. Outlook Mail is really just OK, I do like the Windows Version better where you can pin folders that matter to your front screen and they update seperately. In the main mail app, it kind of merges stuff together and it can get hard to seperate stuff out, of if that new message is important. I am figuring it out slowly. In the meantime I do use my Windows Phone as a backup mail client. The other Office apps are pretty nice and work well, Windows 10s version seem to be similar for eveything but mail.\n8. Contacts and calling can sometimes be a pain. Luckily in the LGV10 (what I got) you can pin contacts to the 2nd screen so I put important contacts there.\n9. You can't make a call via Google now (using the BT to Gnow hands free app). when the phone is locked. So on the go hands free is almost useless for me. I have yet to find a solution.\n10. When launching BT to Gnow to send a text message when the phone is locked, it will go through the process but will not actually send the message even though it said it did. WTF?\n11. When in hands free using voice to text message, it will not read the message back to you before sending it or prompt you. I have not found a way to solve this so I just live with it.\nThe bad:\n1.

Looking back, I used to blow off the 'app gap,' but seriously, 90% of the apps that I have installed on my Note 5 do not exist on Windows Phone. And the apps that do exist on both platforms - with the exception of 'Groove,' the experience is exceptionally better on Android. Widgets are better than live tiles, but not by much. Having never used Android in the past, I went in with high expectations regarding widgets and customization options, but after a few months of using Android, I haven't been overly impressed.\nAt the end of the day, even if Microsoft does make a gorgeous \"Surface Phone,\" I probably won't go back.

The Cortana integration into the OS is great! I love that whenever I'm driving, if I get a text, Cortana comes in over the speakers via Bluetooth and announces I have a text and who it's from, and if I want to read or ignore it. Then once I have her read it, she asks if I want to reply, and then dictates back everything I said for approval before sending. The hands-free Bluetooth integration of Cortana is second to none-from what I've heard and experienced so far.\nI use my phone as a phone first and foremost and this feature while driving (or even while working out at the gym hands-free via bluetooth earphones is close to impossible for me to give up at this point.\nI've searched hi & low but haven't found an Android solution that comes close yet. My question to the community is, am I missing something or is there an app (or apps) that duplicate this functionality even relatively close? I've heard the Moto Assist / Moto Voice apps built into Moto phones can come close... is that true? But I've also heard they are getting rid of those apps with Marshmallow.\nIf I could get this functionality on Android, I'd make the full switch, so any and all help is truly appreciated. NOTE: I'm on Verizon right now and can't switch, so I'm using a Samsung ATIV SE Windows phone as my daily driver and a Note 4 as a backup Phablet device when I need to access apps I may not have on WM... which is only about a handful.)\nI'd be interested in switching if someone could help with the hands-free bluetooth functionality.", "time": "12-09-2015 01:49 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4917155", "text": "There are some Bluetooth headsets that do this, including Android Auto w/bluetooth and if you get an Android Wear device, you can also reply with voice very easily.

But bluetooth headsets are cheaper.\nAt the end of the day though WP 10 is simply not even close to ready for primetime, and MS should not have released the 950 and 950XL. A number of online retailers refuse to sell it any more. At the same time, the app gap has gotten worse, not better.

My recollection from 6 mos. ago was that they were no longer offering contracts, and had replaced that system with 0% 24-month credit on your new phone, with monthly payments automatically added to your bill. At least, that is what I got from them on my Edge+.\nAs to your original question, after 6 mos. with this phone, I agree with Kramer about the \"edge\" part making gripping the phone difficult. And the edge features mostly go unused by me, in part because I find it difficult to swipe the edge menu onto the screen and it usually takes 2 or 3 tries. If I was doing it again I would have gotten the Note, which is basically the same phone, minus the edge stuff, plus the stylus. But that's just my take.\nI should add I am using my phone without a case. I am actually gonna add a case soon because I think that will help with picking it up. (One of the big issues for me is it's hard to handle the phone without inadvertently touching the edge part of the screen, which can cause unwanted things to happen -- I think having a case will help with this especially).", "time": "03-27-2016 12:30 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5092823", "text": "Sd card slot isnt the only way to store data.

They look TERRIBLE. They look even worse than the images from my first digital camera, a 1.4 megapixel Fuji. I use Adobe Lightroom so it will be interesting to take them into Lightroom and see how they clean up, but my quick impression is that it isn't worth shooting RAW on this phone.

I work for Verizon and we are eliminating the 2 year contracts and are upset that best buy is trying to trick people into the 2 year contract as we at the Verizon corporate stores never push the 2 year contract, under the 2 year contract even if your phone broke or you absolutely hated it you can not upgrade at all even if you had the cash upfront to buy a new device ,you would need to open a new line, at least when you make the payments it's a flat 32 a month and their is no interest and you have cheaper data plans available, the more everything plan is the best way to go but if you don't use that much data you can always change it , and let's say you have the device for one year and you really want the latest and greatest thing you can pay off the remaining 50% of the phone keep your old device and jump into a new device with the same payment structure without any early termination fees ,as to the 2 year contract in order to get a new phone for your self before your 2 years is up you would need to cancel the line pay for the early termination fees and it would default your 1 dollar price of your device back to full price and than you would need to pay that off . I like verizon I just get frustrated with their update lag on their devices, but to end this rant lol never get stuck on a old-school 2 year contract the Verizon payment plan saves you a lot of money, I know people jump at the 1 dollar deal but when they see how much more they will be spending in that 2 years they end up calling us and yelling at us and corporate can not fix it once it's done.

Nahhhh....no way!\nAnyway, i had a $200.00 credit hanging out on Amazon, and the white Edge Plus was selling for $583.00 NO TAX, so i went for it.... I had seen the Edge Plus last year at Best Buy, but with that stupid mechanism on it there is just no way to tell how amazing it feels in the hand, plus there was never a white Edge s6+ there...\nThe last Sammy phone i had was Note 4, and man o man, have they stepped it up!

I though about giving something new a chance (I already used iOS before, not a fan) so I got myself a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ (that's a long name) and I really cannot say I am enjoying the experience. I understand it is Samsung's own launcher (still learning Android terminology) called TouchWiz, and not Android itself, but this is just horrible. It looks very cartoonish and childish, with all the colours and a bunch of icons crammed on one screen.\nCan I make the UI look less like that and more... Serious? I tried several other launchers, and while some of them do change the looks completely (of the start (home) screen, at least), they still look like they were made for teenagers. I did those things back in the day of DesktopX for PCs and Symbian phones (am I too old for this?). I remembered that I used to have Samsung phones in the past and how Samsung always struggled with the software part (like, when they released Samsung D600 that had a slot for a memory card, so I thought I could finally listen to my music on my phone, so I put a card in there with a few GB of songs, and it turned out that Samsung made their MP3 player to only be able to play up to 30 songs at a time...).\nAnyway, I am really starting to regret ever switching to Android.

I suffer them too and Lollipop and Marshmallow just made everything worse. It's not a Samsung problem any more, it's a Google problem. Material Design as shown by Google on \"stock Android\" is equally horrible. The OS looks like a circus. Only the OnePlus X has a fix for that by having added themselves a Dark Theme to Android. From the design point of view, Windows Phone 8.1 and prior were vastly superior to Android's designs.\nTo answer the \"will I get use to it\"? Probably not. I still haven't and I jumped ship from WP over a year ago.\nAs for what you can do...I'll tell you what I did on the G4 and I hope it helps:\n(0 - go to the Samsung Theme store and get a dark theme. LG's themes don't touch notification trays and system UI but Samsung's do, which is positive).\n1 - Get Nova Launcher (If you can, pay for the Prime version. It will be worth it). Nova allows you to basically create a home screen to your liking, change all the icons, gestures, fonts, etc. It will also allow you to create folders with dark backgrounds. Oh and it rids you of TouchWiz.\n2 - Get icon packs. I use \"Dark Glow\" and \"3K SR BLACK - Icon Pack\". And if you want to go a step further and create your own, \"Icon Changer\" will help you create your own.\n3 - Time to replace the stock apps. \na) \"Truedialer\" (also available on WP) can replace your phone app on Android. It has a dark theme.\nb) \"Textra\" can replace your sms app. It's an amazingly designed app with a dark AND a full black theme (ideal for AMOLED) and that will sort of remind you of the sms app on Windows Phone.\nc) \"BlueMail\" is a great email client. It's similar to the Outlook app but has more functionality and...you guessed it. A dark theme \nd) \"File Commander\" is a great app for managing folders etc (think microsoft's \"Files\" on WP). It has a dark theme.\ne) \"QuickPic\" is a great app to replace your stock photos app.\nf) If you want a music player, I definitely recommend \"BlackPlayer\" (again, if you can, the premium EX version is absolutely worth it).\nThe only major app I haven't found with a proper dark theme in it is a Calendar app. All calendar apps I've tried keep white backgrounds.\nAnd you're done. Your Android is now more sober and less childish. I just hope Google smells the coffee and eventually puts a dark theme on Android N.\nThe UI on Android phones is pretty diverse but anything that uses \"Material Design\" is a disaster. If other OEMs don't take a page out of OnePlus' book, I'll seriously have to take UI in consideration when I buy my next Android phone (hopefully not...I expect Nokia to not go along with the childish UI colours on their phones...but we never know)", "time": "01-14-2016 08:50 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4947072", "text": "Hi, I noticed you mentioned changing the launcher, but have you tried downloading a different theme from the Samsung Store? you can find mature themes in there that completely change the whole Touchwiz experience.", "time": "01-13-2016 04:50 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4947159", "text": "I did try other themes for TouchWiz, too, but those mostly just change the icons and the wallpaper?

I didn't need quick charge, since I didn't need to recharge the battery twice in 24hrs (and I prefer it that way). I don't care about the camera because I own an entry-level DSLR and no cell phone in the world can come even close to that (I don't carry it with me all the time, but I also don't take pictures/videos all the time; additionally, the battery life of a phone when taking pictures or recording videos goes down really fast, and then you can't use it as a phone any more). I don't know if you can, but you should really try and compare the same photo taken with any cellphone and any DSLR. The difference is just mind boggling and I doubt you'll ever take a photo with your cellphone again.\nAs for Google Now, is that restricted to certain regions, since it isn't working all that well? Most of the time it just does a Google search for what I say (e.g. when I say 'what do I have on Monday' or 'show me my calendar for Monday' it actually does an image search for a picture of a calendar with Monday circled on it). I managed to get it to set an alarm and a reminder, but for everything else ('tell me a joke' finds a website with jokes) it just does a search on Google. Samsung's S Voice is just horrible and it sounds like it wants me to end its suffering.\nNow, fitness devices, banking apps, fingeprint security, apps in general... I don't need any of those. I live in Serbia, so most of those aren't available, anyway. Apps are LOADED with ads, so much that I hate using them (the few ones I do use, for Reddit, Imgur, a newsreader and a couple of others maybe).

I don't know if you can, but you should really try and compare the same photo taken with any cellphone and any DSLR. The difference is just mind boggling and I doubt you'll ever take a photo with your cellphone again.\nAs for Google Now, is that restricted to certain regions, since it isn't working all that well?

But here are my thoughts...\nI do miss the clean layout of a Windows Phone. However, on Android you can change the layout to what you want. Hey who knows, maybe MS will come out with another launcher (besides Arrow) that looks more like WP.\nI do miss live titles. Yes, you can add widgets, but I'm not sure the concept (performance, battery life, etc) is the same. What I've done is add Snap Swipe Drawer which allows me to have widgets available but away from my home screen (see later on for an alternative).\nI'm deciding between Action Launcher and Nova Launcher to when I make the final move. I don't use many apps in a constant basis. So I've setup my home screen with 3 folders. The folders have pretty much everything I need and keeps the home screen clean. Instead of those lifeless icon that are the trademark of both iOS and Android. The rest of the apps are in the app drawer. I've not setup folders in the drawer yet, but I will to make things simpler.\nI might add a weather widget that is simple to balance the home screen out.\nMy life is in the MS ecosystems and will continue to be there for the foreseeable future. So I've installed the MS apps that I use. Outlook, Office, Skype, OneDrive and Cortana. \nFor the most part the MS apps are either the same or better than in W10M. However, there are three things that I don't like with them.\n1) Cortana is not fully integrated (and probably will never be unless you go with a Cyanogen phone and at this moment only one of them). But what I really don't like is that if I set a reminder in Cortana it will remind me as late as 15 minutes later than it is supposed to. This is hopefully a bug that is fixed.\n2) I cannot send SMS from my PC using Cortana. Of course, there are other ways to do this so there is a workaround. For instance using Pushbullet will accomplish this and much more.\n3) Here is the big omission in the MS apps that is one of this you say \"What? Really You Can't Do That? What Were They Thinking?\" You cannot update your contacts in the Outlook app.\nSo since I want to use the Outlook app for all my other stuff, I had to setup an Exchange Sync with the stock Android app so I can update and add new contacts on the phone.\nNow going back to the launchers, there are just so many that is hard to decide which to use. But I find that one of the two I mentioned will be the ones that I will use for now because they give me what I need. One thing that I like about Action Launcher is the feature it calls shutters. It basically add the Widget for the application on the icon itself. So for instance you can swipe on your Outlook icon and see the Agenda or Inbox widget. I think this is a great feature. \nYesterday I discovered the Min Icon Pack. I like it because it is very \"min\" and I think it looks elegant.\nAnyway, like I said, I've not completely move yet since I can still return my phone if I decide not to go Android. \nOh, I forgot, I bought the Moto X Pure (Style outside the US). I think you get a lot for the money. And you get a lot less for the money. What I mean by that, is that I don't get a bunch of bloatware you might (most likely) will from others. I bought it from Amazon which means nothing but stock Moto ware setup. And it is upgraded to Android M.\nThe Nexus 6P was too expensive for me.

Yes, you can change the layout on Android but I haven't found one yet that I really like. I can bear some of them and that's it. I tried flashing a few custom (and rooted) ROMs, but they were clearly made by teenagers with teenage ideas about style, design, UI and everything else. And they didn't even bother to remove Samsung's S-apps, so I returned the stock ROM and I'll leave it as that.\nI too keep the screen clean of icons - I have one home screen with a few icons at the bottom (that I use the most - phone, SMS, Contacts and Opera). There is five more apps in the 'Edge' screen (you swipe from the right and you get a list of five apps - there is an option to add contacts also, but I can't get that to work) and that is it. The rest of my tiny app library is in the 'app drawer' - Microsoft apps, Viber, Messenger, a news reader (I chose Feedly, though I deeply miss Fuse), Philips Hue (miss Oni A LOT) and I wanted to put Discovery News (miss its live tile), but apparently, they don't update if for Android, so it won't even start. That's it - I read dozens of 'best Android apps' lists, but I didn't find a single one I would use. I got Android and Windows Central apps, though \nI also miss Cortana and Outlook's Calendar, especially the former. Cortana on Android is choppy and looks like it will fall apart at any moment. Just like you, I also can't update Outlook contacts from the Contacts app, but a friend of mine on an LG G3 can, so I've no idea who is to blame.\nI'll give Action Launcher a shot (don't remember if I did already), but most of them look the same to me. Some are really bad (I gave up on the one I initially liked, Buzz, because it was too complicated to use). I have the Lumia 1520 on the table and Windows just looks so much more... Modern. Icons are a thing of the past, even on my PC my desktop is empty and everything is in the Start menu. Android can be customized into oblivion, so much so that two Android users can't use each other's device because of the UI differences between them. But with all that, even with good icons and decent launchers, it doesn't come close to tiles, not for me anyway.\nHow did you setup Exchange Sync with the Contacts app?

There is no comparison between Tiles and Icons. My PC desktop has one icon. The Recycle Bin. That's it.\nAs far as setting up contacts this is what I did.\n1) Installed MS Outlook and connected to my two Office 365 accounts and my two Live accounts\n2) I made sure that I didn't Sync Contacts for each account is turned off in Outlook. What this does is syncs Outlooks clients with Office 365 and Live, but not with the local contacts\n3) When to the local setting on the phone and under Accounts I added the same accounts as above. Once I added, I made sure that the synching option for Calendar and Mail are turned off. The only one is Contacts. \nSo now what you have is your contacts are synching from Office and Live to your phone. And you can make changes and add contacts from there.\nI might decide to Sync calendars too. Even thought I would be using Outlook for calendars I might want the events in the stock app so I can use the Do Not Disturb with those events.\nIf you've tried Nova Launcher, I don't think you are going to get more (or less) from Action Launcher with the exception of the mentioned shutters. I don't think Nova has that.\nHere are the two reasons I would move to Android\n1) I build systems for companies. One of the system that I'm building right now will need a couple of mobile apps. These are going to be develop for Android and iOS. As I mentioned before in Windows Central, there is no way the customer will pay for development of the apps for WP. Simply there is no Market for it.\n2) The app gap just got to me. As I said, I don't use many apps. But here is a few examples...\nMy car manufactures provides a mobile app that will work with all mobile phones as long as those phones are iOS or Android\nI have two banks. Both have mobile apps that only work in iOS and Android.\nSo yes, I've lived without these so I can continue to do so. \nBut take for example the bank apps. I can do mobile deposit from them. I work out my home for several clients. \nSo here is my scenario.\nI don't get checks from clients the same day. So in a week say I might checks on Monday and Wednesday.\nI can go the bank on Tuesday and Thursday to deposit those checks or hold on to the one from Monday and hope I get the one on Wednesday and then go to the bank.\nSo I'm either wasting time driving to the bank or not having the money available while I wait for the other check.\nI go the bank twice a month. Each time it takes about 45 minutes by the time I go there, deposit the checks and drive back. \nOne of my banks has had an app for about 6 years. So let's do the math. It cost me about $70 worth of not working to go the bank. That makes it $140/mo. In the last 6 years that has cost me $10,000+ in non billable time.\nI could had bought tons of phones by now \nWhen I got my first WP 5 years ago, it would annoy me that companies wouldn't develop for it. Now, it doesn't anymore. The reason it does't anymore is that the fault is not the companies, it is MS's. MS didn't do what they had to do to make WP what it could had been.\nOkay I'm stopping now.

At the moment, I think Windows Phone 8.1 is the best, most polished OS for mobile.\nAlso, I am not seeing any real benefit from not having the \"app gap\" any more. There are tons of them, but most of them are useless to me. I found equivalents of the ones I used on Windows, and that's it. I'm not using anything new that I didn't have on Windows.

The videos are terribly low-res and blurry, the image quality is like watching old TVs from the 80s or so. The one thing I do like (even with terrible image quality) is Google's street view, which does make you feel like you are there (like, right under the Eiffel Tower).

I read it and close the app, but the notification is still left in the notification centre showing the same message I just read, and whenever I get a new message from Messenger, the old/first message still only shows up. To be able to see new messages I have to delete everything in my notification centre and wait for someone to send me a new message. And it goes on and on from there. This is just not with Messenger, it's with all apps.\nSo basically, the app notifications don't update themselves.

Sometimes that can be good -- other times you can be stuck with a problem that needs to be fixed. Some of Google's updates have caused problems for users. See the problems AT&T users are having getting reliable LTE performance after Google's latest update for the 6P. They are stuck waiting for the next update. You also have to wait for the apps to be updated to catch up with the updates. Many are just now being updated to work with marshmallow. \nSound is about the same on the two devices to me, especially using headphones. The LG V10 distinguishes itself from a sound standpoint, but the others don't, at least to me. I usually stream Spotify and they sound about the same. \nThe screen and camera are much better on the S6 Edge+. Samsung also has extras that may, or may not be important to you. I use my device for business and Google has nothing close to the email, calendar and contacts apps for me. The 6P is faster and has better battery life under similar use, although the S6 Edge+ is not bad at either. I have learned to set up my S6 Edge+ where it is pretty comparable for battery life, without sacrificing anything important to me, but if you use it without tweaking the settings (100% display brightness, unlimited location services, Google Now, etc.) battery life will suffer more on the S6 Edge+.\nThe 6P is big and heavy and slippery. The S6 Edge+ is much nicer to carry, use and hold. \nIt is also significant to me that AT&T, my network, does not support HD Voice of voice over LTE for the 6P, where it does for the S6 Edge+. \nAgain, as I said, it depends on what is important to you.

I love the Nexus 6P.\nI don't have any LTE issues on AT&T, or any other major issues. I find the screen as close as it gets. The camera on the S6 Edge+ is definitely better, but the one on the 6P is very, very good. Really it's just a bit slower, and missing OIS which impacts videos.\nMusic quality is identical, whether through Bluetooth or direct Android Auto connection, or wifi/Chromecast Audio. \nThe fingerprint scanner position is better in my view on the Nexus, but that's completely subjective. But it is miles quicker on the Nexus.\nOverall, the only things I really miss are:\n1. Samsung Pay, and it's ability to use anywhere due to MST\n2. Sexiness and feel of the S6 Edge+. It feels like a more premium device than the Nexus, although once you have a case on either, it's not noticeable.\n3. The speed and reliability of the Samsung camera. Although I have not had problems with the Nexus. It's quick enough.\nWhat I prefer about the Nexus:\n1. Immediate security updates.\n2. Speed/smoothness and lack of any lag... Ever. Although with the S6 Edge+, I rarely ever saw lag.\n3. App switching is quicker since Samsung has such aggressive memory management and closed background apps more quickly.\n4. Everything just works on the Nexus. For example, with the Edge+, it's auto wifi after connecting to an available hotspot, didn't always prompt me immediately with the Accept terms screen of the public wifi. It was hit it miss. The Nexus gets it right every time.\nAs for apps, I didn't use all of the stock Samsung apps. I miss their calendar. But for email, I used Nine Exchange Email, and still think that's the best email client around.\nOverall, if security is really important to you, and Telus us slow with the updates, If recommend switching. If not, I'd recommend sticking it out. The Samsung is a great phone.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "02-21-2016 02:44 PM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"title": "Wow!

[{"title": "Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ weak signal problem!!", "thread": [{"postID": "post4908096", "text": "I've had my edge+ for about 3 months now on Sprint. I had my original edge+ replaced for the horrible signal problems because I and Sprint both thought maybe I just got a bummed phone. I can literally sit next to someone with any other brand device running on Sprint (such as an HTC, LG, or Iphone) and they'll have full LTE service with really great download speeds and mine will continuously bounce. I go from decent LTE signal, to 3g, to 1x, and then no service at all. I'm constantly dropping calls, missing calls and getting a voicemail 3 hours later even though my phone never rang, and there are times I'll try and send a text when signal shows 3 or 4 bars of LTE service and I'll get a message saying unable to send message at this time. I have to airplane mode my phone for almost every single message I send, apps and web pages won't load even though I'm showing service (LTE), and when I finally do get data flowing through mobile connection (again LTE) my speeds are less than 5 mbps down and something like .4 up.. I've read all over the internet about Samsung's choice in device antenna's and this issue seems to be all over the world. Here in the U.S., it seems that Sprint customers are the worst off. I've been fighting and arguing with Sprint for 3 months now, but there are few options for me to replace with a different brand since I'm leasing my edge+ for 2 years! I don't really want a different make or model because this phone rocks other than I can NEVER get good service, or data. Samsung support is useless and offers nothing more than a \"factory reset\" suggestion even though I've already done this more times than I'd care to remember. Is there an update that can possibly solve this? Is this just a horrible design/hardware flaw that I have to live with for the next two years? Is there anyway at all, to miraculously fix this issue with some hidden menu setting? I've scoured every corner of the internet, every forum, every YouTube video and the only things I ever come across are people like me asking the same questions. We need a fix. I use my phone for work and my primary residents, but I end up missing more calls than I ever answer, and have you ever watched your phone try to send a message for hours at a time? My roommate has an Iphone 6s plus and she has nearly full LTE service all the time, sitting right next to me, her download speeds average between 15mbps and 30mbps every day. This is not a network issue, it's a Samsung specific problem that NEEDS resolved!! These phone's aren't cheap and I didn't buy an almost $800.00 paper weight!! Please help lol.

I had the Assurion warranty, so I got a replacement, but it was defective, as was its replacement. I finally gave up and asked for a 3rd replacement. They sent another replacement, but by this time it was obvious I wouldn't get it in time for a business trip to Amsterdam, so I decided to try a Nexus 6P that had overnight shipping from Amazon. It arrived just in time for my trip, while the 3rd replacement for the S6E+ arrived 2 days after I left. So I used the 6P for the last week while in Amsterdam.\nHere's my assessment for what it's worth. Firstly, yes, agree with others who said you can't go wrong with either one. There are some major differences though.\nNexus 6P:\nSmooth as butter, may not be as quick as the S6E+ according to the benchmarks, but it feels quicker. App switching is an absolute joy, and feels even quicker than the iPhone 6S plus I have as my work phone (that is by far the fastest device on the market right now). \nIt's fingerprint reader is just instantaneous, and I like its back location more than the front one on others. This is also nice since I use Nine for Exchange as my email client, and if supports unlocking through fingerprint, and unlocks instantaneously. I left my AW watch charger at home and couldn't use trusted devices, so my Nexus would typically be locked when I picked it up. This would have been annoying on the S6E+ given that it's fingerprint reader is rather slow by comparison.\nI found that I didn't miss the admittedly slightly superior screen of the S6E+, and I love the stereo speakers on the Nexus. I also far prefer stock Marshmallow to any manufacturer's layer on top of that regardless of the additional functionality.\nFor everyday activities like typing, scrolling, app switching, its just better, quicker, etc.\nNegatives for the 6P:\n1. Camera's quick launch is about 4x slower than that of the S6E+, sometimes just doesn't work, and the camera is definitely not in the same league unless you've got time to try a few shots. If you do, you can probably equal the S6E+ in most scenarios. After the perfection that is the camera on the S6E+, its difficult to adjust to the Nexus 6P's camera, even if it is still very good. I think it's because I've been very spoiled by how I can double click and be taking 5 or 6 photos in seconds, and they all seem to just be great on the Samsung.\n2. Overall phone feel:\nThe Nexus for its price feels fairly premium. But it feels too light and not solid enough in comparison to how the S6E+ feels. It's metallic exterior feels like its a fee months from rubbing off and exposing a plastic body. Not saying that's really how its made, but it feels like it.\nSince I used it with a case, that didn't bother me most of the time, but it feels less premium.\nThat's about it. In most other areas, these phones are about as good as it gets there days.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "01-16-2016 05:51 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Bluetooth Turning Off", "thread": [{"postID": "post4948151", "text": "I've been noticing for the past couple of weeks that my smartunlock via my Asus Zenwatch 2 keeps failing.

But the problem was, I was standing right beside my phone. The phone and Jabra were both charged. I have been using the Jabra easygo BT headset for weeks since bought the phone in June 2015 with not one single problem. Now, it beeps, disconnects then reconnects (briefly before beeping again) connecting only for phone audio, then disconnects again and may not reconnect at all or it does and this time maybe only for media playing. Super frustrating!! The whole time beeping like I have walked 500 steps away and got out of range for the BT to connect. But I haven't.\nSo I am thinking - well - the Jabra Easygo - is about 1 1/2 years old or so - maybe its time to get a new BT. (Still not suspecting the phone at this point...) So I went out purchased a brand new Jabra Talk - great battery life - can stream music/Audio, easy touch buttons. \"Perfect!\" I say.\nSo I pair it up with my phone (took a bit for the phone to find it - but then it paired fine.

At first I waned the Edge+ but then after trying a few units in different shops I noticed that the home button is kinda loose. By loose I mean moving up and down (kind of like the one on the s6) instead of being stiff. Also I am pretty scared that it will be forgotten by Samsung after a while, just like my brand new s3 was forgotten back in the day (it only went from 4.0 to 4.3). Those being said..I think those two are my only concerns about the Edge+\nOn the other hand..is the Nexus 6P it's also a device I would like. It will always have the latest Android version (at least for about 3 years) and to me it looks okay. Not as sexy as the S6 edge+ but still looks nice. With this device I am concerned about either scratching the back of the graphite version..this exposing the raw aluminium...having the \"visor\" crack for no reason and I am also kinda concerned about the rigidity of the phone...last night I saw a guy on youtube bending it quite easily.\nWhat would you recommend, guys? Nexus 6P or the Edge+\nPlease think what would you choose for yourself...and let me know. Also, are my concerns real? Did anyone scratch the back of the 6P or had it's visor crack by itself? Does anyone have an edge+ with a loose button? Hopefully if someone owns this device..they can shoot a really quick video showing the stiffness of the home button.\nAlso, even better...if someone owns both phones...which one would you pick again?\nTLDR version: Nexus 6P or Edge+?

It's screen is a bit nicer, it's camera is better in almost all scenarios. It's got Samsung Pay if mobile payment is important to you and you live in the US, that's supported in more places than either Android Pay or Apple Pay.\nThere are many other things that are better.

You'll see a weird little drunk (lol not really drunk but funny) android guy and a message that says downloading or download failure (don't panic). You will then see a list of commands that you can select by scrolling with volume up or down buttons. Highlight the wipe cache partition and hit power button, this will free up some additional space and helps prevent screwy behavior. After cache wipe (only takes a few seconds), use the volume button to scroll to and highlight restart device and press power button again. Your device will restart as normal. I try to do this about once a week or so. Also, while device is on and running, make sure your screen is \"awake\" and you can press and hold volume down and power button until phone shuts down, this is Samsung's equivalent of removing the battery.

Ready? Great!\nPackaging, what's included, and pictures - I thought it was great packaging. It was straight to the point at protecting the product and easy to remove from the box. I've in the past dealt with boxes that are literally a maze to open. I'd love it if it came with chocolate though. It did included the usual manual, warranty card, and a USB cable which can serve as the main USB cable or a spare. \nProduct durability/stability/usage - when I held the fast wireless charging unit in my hand I thought it felt very durable. I even dropped it by mistake and thought it would not work or even worse crack but to my surprise it worked just fine.* Over the course of 1 week and a few days I kept it at my work station at work and I and few Android users at work used it on and off. It didn't once give issues with any devices except a nexus 6 which is curved at the back so it wouldn't sit properly nor charge at full speed but that's obviously due to lack of fast wireless support. I'd say it has stood its ground so far when using it on my galaxy s6 edge+.\nLikes and dislikes - I personally didn't like that my s6 edge + takes over pretty much all of the size of the pad but that isn't a product issue as they do offer a more square option for someone who dislikes this version. I did like that it's all eco friendly packaging and of course it includes a nice USB cable which comes in handy in my opinion as you can never have too many. Its my first fast wireless charger that takes advantage of fast charging wireless on my s6 edge + so obviously another like! I lastly liked the price of $36! That's super cheap compared to samsungs solution. That is about it regarding the likes and dislikes.\nOverall I'd highly recommend this product if you're seeking to take advantage of fast wireless charging to max out the charging rate of your device (note 5 and s6 edge+). Even if you don't have a fast wireless charging device it is still nice. My co workers with galaxy s6 units all loved it as it is nice to be able to sit down and pick up your device easily. If you don't own one already, go to Amazon and order one as it does include an amazing 18 month warranty so you can't go wrong. ;-)", "time": "12-16-2015 03:18 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4897538", "text": "What did you actually plug it into?

Is that an unlocked version? I don't have the edge+ yet, I'm ordering it today or tomorrow. Just haven't desided with carriers I'm going with. I like to stay of contract and hop from Verizon and sprint. Carrier bloat hasn't been an issue as much for me because for the most part it can be romoved. Were i live Verizon by far is the dominant carrier and sprint is next then att and T mobile last. So this time with att and all the hype they made about there signal improvements I thought I'd give them another chance. Plus Verizon and the locked bootloader and always last for updates got frustrating when I had my Note 4 so I'm using a verizon phone on att network lol it's a joke signal is still bad. Went from 5 bars always on verizon to 2 or 3 with att. So they still suck there. Now I have ran into so huge issues that bother me and since in the first post he mentioned issues with his phone and I'm about to order a att edge + I think I need a little more info before I purchase the att version. So the issue I have on my edge with att are all basically call related and anyone having a factory unlocked phone might be able to help as well like for instance when I make a call and Hut dail and I've counted it takes between 20 to 39 seconds before the line rings this phone on verizon about 5 max. Vary noticeable for me. Other issues are now and then it my phone thinks I'm making a international call or sometimes I get no Sim errors. Or if I miss a call I can't just click on the missed call to dail it I actually have to type it in at times because when I just click on it it goes right back to thinking I'm placing an international call. Vary iritating if u ask me. I know its not the phone because it doesn't do it on verizon the biggest thing that urks me about this phone and it is this phone is I can't make a call and use Internet at the same time, so people said with HD voice that fixed it well I I had HD voice on verizon and no fix. From what I've read as far as my other issues call related is each network optimize the phone to there on work best on thete network. So even if u can use a different carrier phone on a different network it isn't always gonna work the way it's supposed to like I can't just dail *611 anymore either. So that was why I wad gonna get the att version edge + another thing to consider per carrier beside their pretty installed apps is they tend to remove Samsung pretty installed apps as they see fit like att got rid of most Microsoft apps I think and most carriers removed one drive which offered 15o gig free storage to new s6 users when it came out and put there garbage cloud apps on instead not sure what comes on an unlocked phone or what's removed if anything but even my drop down menu has quick connect and S search removed on it but still have download booster. Even though I might have removed them myself or never used at all it's not the point and maybe unlocked phones is the way to go for me, now but some carrier apps I actually do really like and use like the my account and verizon navigation I think it better then Google maps not happy with 9.9o a month but it is better and faster to navigate and is rarely wrong Google maps is iffy sometimes. As far as Ota software updates are concerned I always thought I had to take out my sim and put it that carrier one like Verizon Sim to get my update then after it done I put my att one back in? Because if I could just leave my att sim in and hit update it would be much better. How does that work for a unlocked phone? If u take a update from att on ur phone doesn't that put the att software on ur phone as well because I know when rooted u have to have ur carrier firmware right or u could brick ur phone. How does it work on an unlocked phone? You can't just pick and choose what carrier firmware u want to choose and usually I've only seen firmware for the big 4 carriers except with the note 4 developer edition, but that in my opinion is a different version phone all together like edge and edge+ we can't use each others firmware. So the updating process for an unlocked phone I'm curios about and if I can leave my sim in when I'm ready to install 5.1.1\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "09-06-2015 02:27 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4689786", "text": "I bought that exact ebay phone you're talking about two and a half weeks ago and it's been perfect.

A factory reset will erase all of the information stored on your device and will restore the software to original manufacturer settings. It will not remove software updates but it can undo any changes to settings that might be causing you problems.\nIn order to back up your data, you will need to install Smart Switch onto your PC. You can download Smart Switch from the following link:Transfer Data from Samsung to Samsung Galaxy | Smart Switch\nOnce Smart Switch is installed, please follow these steps:\n1. Connect your device to your computer using the Samsung USB Cable that came with your device (the charging cable with the plug head removed)\n2. Open Smart Switch and click the Back Up/Restore tab.\n3. Click Data Backup\n4. Mark the check box next to the content you want to back up. You can select all content by marking the check box next to Select all Items. Click Backup.\n5. Click Complete when the backup is finished.\n6. You can have Smart Switch automatically back up your device every time it\u2019s connected by clicking the check box next to Automatically back up when USB connection is established.\nTo factory reset the device please follow the next steps:\n1. From the Home Screen, tap the Applications menu item.\n2. Tap on Settings.\n3. Scroll down to Back up and Reset.\n4. Tap the Factory Data Reset menu item.\n5. Tap the Reset phone button.\n6.

Problem is like many on here that music played through car bluetooth skips intermittently for about a second and comes back. It may happen 5 times in a song or once. I''ve tried many of the tips suggested on here but so far no dice. Problem is that the S6 edge was fine with no issues.

It sports 4gig of ram which should preclude any processor anurisms but it is very dissapointing to say the least ! I can conclusively say the it is a bluetooth issue which is weird considering thephones run identical software. Samsung is quick to point their finger at 3rd party apps as their email reply today but again the phones are just clones with one having a bigger brain, same apps same everything. The most promising improvement was to run music through power amp player which I thought had fixed it but after an hour or so murphy was back.

My partner has the iPhone 6 and the battery stats always shows hours upon hours of usage even though he doesn't touch his phone, literally it will just sit at his desk.\nThe way iOS calculates its usage is inclusive of everything that goes on with the device, including background activity. So whatever \"usage\" is listed on the battery stats on the iPhone does not translate to actual \"Screen On Time\".\nFrom my experience, from a full charge you will get the same screen usage time on both phones but when it comes to stand-by, the iPhone will last over 3 times longer. This is a non-issue if you're a heavy user and charge your phone daily. But if you favor stand-by efficiency the iPhone is by far and away the clear winner. \nThis has always been the case between iOS and Android, but the difference is bigger right now because from my personal experience Lollipop is so far the least-efficient version of Android when it comes to stand-by times.", "time": "10-11-2015 06:46 AM", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post4742245", "text": "Agreed.

But I'm a mobile geek. And I bore easily. And I love Android Wear. I have an S6 Edge Plus which was a loan from Samsung (which they haven't asked back) and I really like the idea of it becoming my daily driver. I'm fully bought into Android as well as iOS as I've been flip flopping between the two OS' for years. And I love the openness of it.\nBUT - there is one thing that is stopping me and that is this:\nI do a lot of driving for work and I have a great setup with my stereo system, It connects via Bluetooth audio, I can just yell 'Hey Siri' and tell it to, say, 'play music by Louis Armstrong' and with the tight integration with Apple Music and it plays it well. I don't have to take my hands off the wheel and it streams the song within a second or two.\nI've always thought Google Now much better, but I have real issues with getting it to play music. I have Spotify installed and I've also added Google Play Music Premium but Samsung appears to have crippled this a bit.. You have to have the phone charging for it to work with the screen off (no biggie - I have a charge in my car), but if I tell it to play music, it says 'OK' and then it does nothing. I have to then unlock the screen before it actually completes the command. Which obviously negates the whole point. I may as well pull over every song and manually do it.\nI can't stress how frustrating this is. What I want to do is just be able to say 'OK Google, Play Madonna Holiday' and for it to play the song. Not for me to have to say that, then unlock the phone and repeat all over again.\nSome points:\n* All voice recognition options in the 'voice detection' settings are enabled.\n* When I say 'unlock', I mean get past the lock screen.

If you can't find it in setup, I can only suggest checking the user manual. It's really handy to give bands separate SSIDs for easy identification, but if you set the phone to use one or the other it will pick it that band for you, you don't have to do it manually.\nHere's some things to try to sort this out. I know you said you don't know much about this stuff but try to get through as best as you can. Post back here for more help:\nTry these steps, in order, until it (hopefully) works. They are some of the most common fixes for stubborn WiFi connections and have been successful in many cases. Do 1-5 together, 6-10 one at a time: \n1. Go to: Settings > WiFi > Long-press on your network > Forget network. \n2. Turn off the phone. \n3. Unplug the power to the router for at least 30 seconds. \n4. Plug in the router and give it plenty of time to fully reboot, at least 3-4 minutes. \n5. Turn on the phone and try to connect. \n6. Open a browser and get into Setup in the router. \n7. Set security encryption to WPA2/AES. Do not use TKIP or AES/TKIP. \n8. Try setting static IP addresses. \n9. Try using Google's DNS servers. 8.8.8.8 for the primary, 8.8.4.4 for the secondary. \n10. Update your router firmware. \nIf none of these help and the problem is only with this network, it's possible you have a signal interference problem. \nYou need to determine the best setup for your situation and configure the router and phone accordingly. To find the best setup try using WiFi Overview 360. The free version is probably all you need but the Pro version is cheap. https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...ifioverviewpro \nWhen setting up the 5GHz band usually it's best to set the router to use a channel well over 100. Over 150 if there's a clear channel. For both bands of course use channels with the least interference and best signal as indicated by WiFi Overview 360. \nAndroid since v1.0.

[{"title": "From Note 4 to BB Passport to S6 edge+", "thread": [{"postID": "post4691827", "text": "My father gifted me a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 6 months ago, when I first used it, it was the best phone I have ever had. Superb 2 day battery life, amazing camera, great screen especially for browsing the web.\nThen came the curse called Lollipop update, I thought it's gonna make the phone better.....it only made it laggy, battery life went down from 2 days on average usage to 1 day max.....I hated my Note 4 so much at this point....so then I decided to root the phone and go back to Kit Kat 4.4.4 and by rooting it, I won't be forced to update to Lollipop, that went well initially, battery life became decent again, the lag factor was improved but overall, it's not as I wish, when you open apps like the camera for example, it's not instantaneous....\nAdditionally, I kept getting random errors saying \"TouchWiz has stopped working\" so I decided to forget about rooting (Knox warranty is now void though) and went back to Lollipop 5.0.1 but I still got the TouchWiz has stopped working error randomly. Seems like rooting was a bad idea as it seems to have destroyed my phone somehow...\nI then sold it and got a BlackBerry Passport because I love physical keyboards..BIG mistake. This akward keyboard that has the numbers and symbols in a virtual keyboard defeats the whole purpose of being able to quickly type what you want, so I found myself actually slower in typing with this hybrid keyboard setup and I misses a lot of my apps even though I was able to sideload them through the Google Play Store they just don't look right because of the scaling.. Then the biggest problem with BlackBerry that I was facing with the BB Q10, BB Classic, and now with the BB Passport......I thought they might have fixed it by now on BB OS 10.3.2 but nope, the problem is randomly I would start getting duplicate contacts everywhere or contacts will just disappear. I lost many contacts in this process that I was now sick of BlackBerry and swore never to buy a BlackBerry again.....\nSo again, I was shopping for a new phone. I want a phone with a good camera as I don't have a digital camera and I want it to be super snappy and fast. Since I would never touch any iToy because I hate how hard it is to transfer songs to my phone using iTunes, my next choice was the Galaxy Note 5 even though that doesn't seem like a real upgrade from the Note 4 but it's still the best.....\nUnfortunately, they don't sell the Note 5 in 64GB here in Dubai only 32GB and with no expandable SD Card slot, that won't do it for me since my data by itself (MP3s, Videos, Pics) is around 30GB by itself.\nThey do however sell the Galaxy S6 edge+ in 64GB so I asked the sales rep what is the difference between this and the Note 5 and she said the only difference is that it has no S-Pen! GREAT! I never used that gimmick even once on my Note 4 and didn't want an extra burden to worry about breaking it or losing it.\nSo I bought the Galaxy S6 edge+ Gold Color 64 GB and here is my mini review:\nBuild Quality = This is the highest quality phone I ever owned! Feels very premium and luxurious because of its platinum gold color.\nBattery life = 2 days easily with moderate usage, I think the battery life is a bit better than the Note 5 due to the lack of the S-Pen but maybe I'm just imagining things. I was surprised that even though the batter is smaller in capacity than the Note 4 which has a 3200mAH battery and this one has a 3000mAH battery, the battery life is actually better. Mind you I never turn off any features, I want to enjoy everything in my phone so location is on, WiFi is on, 4G is on, you name it.\nOS = It comes pre-loaded with Lollipop 5.1 so I didn't get all the bugs/glitches that were in 5.0.1, that's great.\nPS: when I sold my Note 4 just a week back, it still hadn't received the update to 5.1 I think Samsung are practicing a cheap trick by not offering the update to the older phones to force people to buy their next new phone.\nSnappiness = I am very sensitive to lag, this phone gives me the 0 lag factor even after owning it for 4 days and installing all my apps and literally torturing it. Love how everything opens instantly.\nExample, on the Note 4, when I hit the active apps virtual button to get a scroll list of all my running apps, scrolling through them is super laggy and slow as if I was using a phone from the year 2000 with outdated hardware. With the Note 6 Edge+, scrolling through all my apps is super smooth. It's a night and day difference.\nCamera = First of all, Samsung replaced the stupid shortcut of launching S-Voice by double tapping the home key which was one of the most useless apps ever IMHO and now replaced that shortcut to make it launch the camera when you double tap the home key. As simple as this sounds, this is a superb feature! now when you see something and want to quickly grab your phone to take a photo, all it takes is to double tap the home key button twice and the camera launches in less than a second!\nI took a few photos of my cats with the camera and I was blown away by how fast the auto focus works and how sharp and vibrant the pictures look I could almost swear this was taken by a DSLR camera!\nI am simply blown away by this phone. I am a very picky person usually but this phone fits all my needs and does it with style.\nPicture example of a photo taken by the S6 edge+:", "time": "09-18-2015 03:34 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4692025", "text": "Great review.

Just go in and edit it in the Advanced settings and I think you can add a Poll.\nMy vote would be for the Edge +. Keep in mind, I had the iPhone 6 Plus last year, which is almost identical to the 6S Plus this year. I can compare the two models here. I have not owned a Nexus, so I can't comment on it.Lag: I loved the smoothness of the iPhone and how there was no lag, but there is no lag with the Edge + either.Signal: Both phones have a comparable signal and both perform well as a phone. I know, right?Call Volume: Sammy gets the \"edge\" here. I had problems hearing the caller on my iPhone. However, to be honest, I think it was more the placement of the ear speaker, then the actual speaker volume. Sometimes I'd move the ipHone around and be able to get a louder volume. The Edge + is great as far as caller volume. No issues.Screen: Both perform well, but I do love the aspect ratio of the iPhone screens over Android Screens. The iPhone has a more cinematic size and the Androids have a more Widescreen TV size, IMO.Camera: Once again, comes down to the size for me. Edge + has a wider field of view than the iPhone 6 Plus, so Sammy here. Both take outstanding photos.Response Time: Both phones open apps fast, and both run the apps smoothly as I said above. The Sammy's camera is super quick to open up and the iPhone's camera is noticeably slower to open. Both have quick shutters and can take multiple pictures at one time. Maybe a slight edge to the Sammy because the camera app opens faster than any phone I've ever seen. Double click the home button and the camera's open and ready.Battery Life: Nothing beats an iPhone for battery life. It's at least 2 to 1 as far as comparing the two and in some cases I could actually push that to 3 to 1 for my useage of the two phones. iPhone 6 Plus I charged every night during the week and never charged it during the weekend. NEVER! Edge + I charge 2 to 3 times per day and nightly if I'm not using the Hotspot on weekends.Charging: Edge + of course. Qi + fast charging, hands down. Why Apple hasn't come out with either or both of these is beyond me.Hotspot: The reason I purchased the Edge + and sold my iPhone 6 Plus. The ANdroid Hotspot works everywhere with every device, including Apple. The Apple hotspot only works well with other Apple devices. It isn't worth a dang for a non-iOS device. My phones are my Internet at home, so the hotspot must function well.\nMy 2 pennies.

The 6S plus is not that much different, although heavier. Get the Edge+.\nIt is by far the best looking of the bunch, especially in Silver or Gold. This isn't even opinion it's just fact.\nIt's also a LOT lighter than the 6s plus. Like coming from the Note 4 (176g) to this (154g) it's very noticeable. There's a lot less wrist fatigue when using it one-handed, I can't imagine how bad the 6s plus would be at almost 200g.\nWireless charging and fast charging. Enough said. I don't even use fast-charging, I bought myself a couple of Tylt Vu wireless chargers. Look it up, unlike other wireless charging \"pads\", with this one it's a tilted phone stand, no hunting for the sweet spot. I just drop my Edge+ and it's charging, and with the tilted view I can see when my notifications pop up.\nI know TouchWiz lag is all too well-known, but I personally have never experienced it. I've had the S3, Note 3, Note 4, and this guy but all I do is install Nova Launcher as soon as I get them and I go year to year without any UI lag. Not to mention that with the included Smart Manager out of the box, you can basically run the S6 edge+ like an iPhone. Choose and set which apps are allowed to run in the background and you can run a tight ship with your background processes just like iOS does.\nLast but not least, better camera. Not to say that the 6s camera is bad, iPhones NEVER have bad cameras and for the longest time it was the king of easy-to-use yet great photos for phone cameras, but not anymore. The competition has caught up on shutter speed (the iPhone's main advantage) and are now just as fast when snapping photos but in some cases, produce superior results. This is exactly what the Edge+ has, a super speedy snapper with more dynamic range, better auto-HDR mode, more stable OIS in video recording, not to mention a lot more zoomability because of more megapixels.\nThe only areas the iPhone beats the Edge+ is standby battery, slow-motion video recording, OS updates and I guess the app store. \nThe Edge+ slimmer, lighter, and has an overall smaller footprint while having a bigger (not to mention higher resolution) screen. Android has more customizability, compatibility (wireless charging, Samsung pay) and versatility (Wi-fi hotspots, true NFC) than iOS. Unless you're heavily invested in Apple's ecosystem you will find it very hard to find good reasons to pick the 6s plus over the Edge+.\nI'll leave you with a youtube video comparing the Edge+, 6s plus and G4 cameras. Notice how Samsung wins 3 out of 5 categories and yet (shamefully) the testers still declare there's no clear winner in the contest. But unless you're blind, the winner is obvious. \nA much more unbiased and comprehensive comparison of the phones as a whole from Pocketnow here: \nGood luck, in the end only you can decide which phone is right for you.

I personally never ever felt like I needed to pull out that S Pen when I had the Note 4 so that's a personal choice again but I heard many users easily breaking or losing their S-Pen and it's hard to find one that is genuine online so having an edge+ means one less thing to worry about, breaking that S-Pen. To be fair though, we have to admit this is the snappiest Galaxy ever released, it has the 0 lag factor, Disable TouchWiz and install Nova Launcher and it becomes a dream.\nPS: If you visit the Samsung Galaxy App Store, you will find enhancements to buy for the Edge screen like the notification of calls and such maybe that would help solve one of your concerns?\nThis is my Home Screen (just 1 single page):", "time": "10-02-2015 05:36 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4725169", "text": "The Galaxy S6 Edge Plus is not the successor to the Galaxy Note Edge which you owned.

Since the next S phone is coming out in about 5 months or so, I'm debating between keeping my Note 4 for a while longer or upgrading to the S6E+ now. Nothing's been 100% confirmed yet but there have already been leaks on the S7 regarding specs (came up in AnTuTu and GeekBench listings with a Snapdragon 820 and Exynos 8890 variants), design changes (Magnesium alloy unibody, Turtle glass, dual camera). \nAnyone else on the fence about getting either device?

Everything launches in a split second. Doube tapping the home screen button launches the camera in a sec so you never miss that magical moment you want to shoot.

That's true, my Note 4's battery life did take a hit when I updated to Lollipop. But to be fair, it did return to normal after doing a factory reset.\n3. The leaks do mention that since there are likely to be two variants of the S7, they're probably going to come in two sizes as well just like the S6E and S6E+ pairing. I think Samsung is going the Apple route of releasing two size options for the phone together so we might be seeing an S7E and S7E+ next.\nI wanted to keep my promise to myself of changing my daily driver only once a year, so I guess my only regret about getting the S6E+ now would be that it's only going to be the latest for 5 months before the next S iteration comes.

It is a tempered glass screen protector and seems to do a pretty good job. \nAnyway, since that review is now history, I'll post the TLDR version. \nPros:\n- Price($24.95 + $2.95 S&H when I bought it) \n- Tempered Glass \n- Lifetime Replacement (never tried, but it's listed on the package) \n- No loss of responsiveness. Still 100% accurate as far as I can tell. \n- It covers the entire screen. \nCons:\n- There's a definite hit in terms of screen clarity. It's not terrible, but it's noticeable; especially on whites and greys. \n- The protector covers the front facing camera. It's a clear piece, but still. \n- The sprinkles in the black on the top and bottom of the protector. \nMileage May Vary:\n- When I installed it, I used the standard side-to-side version of the hinge method.

I might suggest a modified version of the hinge going from top to bottom. \nOverall Score: 3.7/5\nLink to purchase:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014K3471U...cUvbUpU4711001\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "09-26-2015 11:27 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4711009", "text": "Pictures of the package and materials.

It started with the Samsung Charge. I hated that phone. It was buggy, laggy, short battery life, and overall one of the worse phones I\u2019ve ever owned. Not the worse mind you. (I did own a BlackBerry Storm.) Then I tried a Samsung Galaxy 3. I thought it was ok, but it was huge for the time. I ended up dropping it within 2 days of owning it and completely destroying the glass. I still have it by the way and it does act as a fill in phone when I need one. So, after that I started down the Motorola path. Loved the Droid Razr line. Great phones, but eventually they\u2019d become laggy. Then they just stopped making new Razrs and moved on to the Turbo, so I moved on to the LG line. Loved that line until the Verizon version of the G4. After seeing the Edge + and watching several reviews regarding it, I decided to order one. I\u2019m glad I did. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll rank up there with the iPhone 6+ or HTC Droid Incredible (Dinc) as one of my favorite phones, but so far it\u2019s pushing its way to the top.\nFinger Print Sensor \u2013 Sammy finally made one that works almost as good as Apple\u2019s. It\u2019s close enough for me. I\u2019ve only had to try again 3 times since setting it up. (After reentering the same thumb 2 times and the other hand's thumb, I haven't had it not recognize my thumb. It's a great sensor.)\nScreen \u2013 I mean what can you say? It\u2019s gorgeous. The most beautiful screen I\u2019ve seen in a long time. It is bright enough to see outdoors.  If I had a complaint it would be that it doesn\u2019t get very dark in a dark room, but there are screen filters that can be added for that. Watching NetFlix on it is perfect. Gaming is sweet. No complaints. It is very interesting to note however, that the extra .2\u201d screen size is not noticeable. In fact, I had to put it up against the G4 to see any difference in the two screen sizes. \nBuild Quality \u2013 Something to behold. For years I\u2019ve been saying that Apple makes the highest build quality devices. Well, Sammy\u2019s giving Apple a run for its money now. The aluminum finish is great. It feels solid and has some heft when holding it which is a good thing. Plastic phones always seem difficult to hold on to because they are too light. If I was going to complain, it would be the back. You cannot keep the back clean. As soon as you even think about touching it, it gets a fingerprint on it. I do have the Sammy slim case on order and hopefully it\u2019ll arrive today. This should help with holding on to it and keep the back from looking like a 3 year old\u2019s been playing with it. (I received the Sammy slim case and wasn't happy about the protection quality, so I did end up purchasing the Incipio case. I'm not wild about the Incipio just because it's hard pushing the buttons, so I might end up going back to the Sammy case. Either way, if you don't use a case, you will have fingerprints.)\nCamera \u2013 Coming from the G4, I didn\u2019t expect the camera quality to be even par with LG\u2019s, but I have to say it takes great photos. At least for the few I\u2019ve taken. Wifey\u2019s got the Sammy G5 and it\u2019s a piece of crap as far as cameras go, but so far the shots I\u2019ve taken with the Edge + look nice. (Great camera. At least as good as the G4, maybe even slightly better with the lighting quality.)\nSammy UI \u2013 They\u2019ve cleaned up the UI a lot since my last Sammy product. I have to say it is less intrusive. While it\u2019s not the stock Android, it seems to run smoothly and respond as fast as you would expect. I\u2019ve never been a fan of TouchWiz, because it got in the way of my Android experience, but so far I am not finding that to be the case with this version. (No issues with the UI. Really haven't found any issues using the phone or with any of the Sammy software.)\nEdge Display \u2013 This is something to keep in mind if you\u2019re trying to decide between the Note 5 or the Edge +. Personally I\u2019ve never been a fan of the Note line and doubt I\u2019d ever use the S Pen, so for me it was all about the look and feel of the phone. I really dig the look of the Edge + over the Note 5. However, the edge display seems like a gimmick to me. I\u2019ve setup a few things, but really, I\u2019m not using it hardly at all. Maybe I will in the future, but so far it\u2019s eh. I will say I like the fact that movies \u201cfall off the cliff\u201d so to speak and look good watching them using it. However, not the same experience with gaming. Since the game also flows into the edges were you normally hold it, I have accidently pressed the screen when I didn\u2019t want to. I do wish the games didn\u2019t use the entire screen. Maybe some updates from the gaming developers will fix this. Or at least they need to turn off the touching ability on the edge during their game app. It\u2019s a developer problem though, not a Samsung problem. (Maybe gimmick wasn't the right word. I do like the infinity display look and it's great for watching Netflix and playing games.)\nBattery Life \u2013 It seems to be a little better than my G4, which is good as they both use a 3000 mAh battery. I\u2019m really hard on phone batteries, but I have been able to squeeze another hour of the phone. Before you say that\u2019s why you need a replaceable battery, batteries do not go bad now days as they did in the past. I have no doubt this phone will be long gone and a memory by the time the battery gives up the ghost. More on the battery in a minute. As for battery life, it's the normal Android Subpar. If you're coming from an iPhone be prepared to hate the life of any Android battery. Yes people. I know there are steps that you can take to extend the life of the battery, but those who come from iPhones know that the steps should have to be taken. It's not horrible, but it's nowhere close to the life of an iPhone. This is an Android issue, not a Sammy issue is all I'm saying.)\nProblems: \nWhy no SD Card slot? They could have integrated it with the dual SIM of the European models. I do see me running out of space quick with this 32GB version. I\u2019m already thinking that I have to clear out the old photos quickly and can only put 1 or 2 shows on it at a time, so an external SD Card would have been highly desirable on my list of needs. Can I live without it? I\u2019m going to find out. (32GB has been fine for me so far. No need for an external SD Card, but it would have been nice to have one.)\nLack of removable battery. This one doesn\u2019t bother me as much. Let\u2019s face it, with today\u2019s external battery backups, there\u2019s no reason to run out of power in your phone. In fact, I\u2019ve only had a few phones with replaceable batteries since switching from my beloved Dinc, so I don\u2019t see this as a problem. I\u2019m sure some will, though.\nI\u2019m not going to say that this is the phone I\u2019m finally keeping for years to come. Let\u2019s face it, I\u2019m not that guy. I can say that this is a great phone and one that I\u2019m very happy I purchased. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll keep it for a year? I do really like it and I do rank it up there with my beloved Dinc and iPhone 6+. Final Update: So now I'm ranking it as the best 4G phone I've had, including the iPhone. It runs smooth as silk still and looks beautiful doing it. Yes, I want a longer battery life out of my phone, but let's face it, Android battery life is what it is. The quick charge is great and gets it back up to 80% really quick, so I don't need a replaceable battery. I haven't had to pull out my external battery charger yet, so that's a plus. I told my wife the other day, that this is the last 4G LTE phone I'll buy for myself. If Verizon lets me keep my unlimited data and move up to a 5G phone in the next few years when 5G comes out, then I'll entertain buying a 5G phone to replace this one. Otherwise I do not plan on buying another phone. I did purchase a 3 year SquareTrade warranty last week making it official. No more phones. I'm done buying.

This is kind of a long story, but I've never experienced anything remotely like it. I'm asking you to indulge me because I'm just that way LOL...and kidding aside, I learned a lot from my shopping trip this morning.\nI went into Best Buy like a lot of people, to look at the two phones side by side, and I've never had a harder full court press than I did from THREE different salespeople about how I really, really, really need to go with the Note 5 instead of the edge+.\nAdmittedly, this was first thing in the morning on a weekday, and the three people working the Sammy Pavilion clearly had time on their hands. I had some time on my own hands while I was getting my car worked on, so I was in no hurry. And because I had the place to myself, I didn't need to be. I was there for 20 minutes or so, and I heard from all three of the salespeople at least twice, and a couple of 'em came by at least four times -- and every single contact was to try to talk me into the Note.\nI've loved my Note 3 mind you...and when I said that, all three of them responded, \"Then you know how cool the pen is!!!!!!\" I could practically hear the emojis coming out of their mouths. To which I replied, \"Uhm, no, I don't use the pen.\"\nAt which point, each of them whipped out their pens to show me all the cool stuff I could do with my S Pen.\nSoon after I arrived, a father and son arrived. I'm guessing the son was mid-40s, the dad late-60s. They both have the Note 3, except the son had his stolen last night, and he too was trying to decide between the Note 5 and the edge+. Neither father nor son ever used their S Pens.\nAnd these guys got the same full-court press I did! Man o man, the salespeople were ALL OVER these 2 fellas. Kept showing them all the cool things they could do with the S Pen. The phrase \"It's all about the S Pen. That's why you want the Note\" came out of their mouths repeatedly. \"You can do so much more with the Note.:\nAND they kept repeating that they're selling hardly any ede plusses, because \"everybody looks at them both and goes straight for the Note. They're selling like crazy.\"\nThe son actually opted for the Note 5 in the end, but half of me wonders if it was just to get these salespeople off his back. \nOn the other hand, wow, amazing customer service. They took good care of me. No matter what I wanted to know, they told me. I even got a tutorial in what I could be doing with my pen. They were VERY attentive.\nUntil I told them that I wanted the edge+, They got icy cold, all three stopped talking to me, barely even LOOKED at me -- and bizarrely enough, were in no hurry to even take my order!!!! I it was like I'd offended them so badly they didn't even want my business. \nOh yeah, and they never once mentioned any positive features about the edge+!!! Not a peep. It never came up until I specifically asked about it, right at the end, right before they stopped talking to me.\nWhen told that the gold 32 wasn't in stock, I asked when they'd get it back in, one of them spat out, \"We get them in every few days.\" In other words, I'm not going to actually look it up for you. One of them at least bothered to go through the motions and said, \"Well, it's hard to tell. Maybe try calling tomorrow or the day after.\"\nThis all made me wonder if there's some kind of incentive that they get for selling the Note 5, and maybe they were mad because I was costing them money. I have no idea.\nI certainly agree that the edge+ is getting more love in GENERAL. The edge and edge+ were on the front side of the Sammy Pavilion, and the Note was on the back. Much bigger signage too, no doubt about it. I see commercials for the edge+ quite regularly, and I'm pretty sure I've never seen one for a Note. Here's my theory: the edge+ looks innovative. It looks like Samsung is swinging for the fences.\nThe problem is that if they lead with the Note...which they've never really advertised before compared to Galaxy...it now looks like they're trying to play catch-up with Apple...even though the Note came long before the new iPhone. \nI don't know about you, but every iPerson I knew mocked me for the Note, saying it was ridiculous, garish, and impractical -- then ran over every dog and senior citizen in their path to buy the big iPhone. It's the curse of Apple's competitors -- no matter how innovative you are, you look like a derivative loser when Apple releases their thing that you had two years ago, because only Apple innovates. RIGHT?\nThat doesn't enter into the conversation with the edge+. People look at that and KNOW that Apple's not doing anything like that. Of course, once Apple DOES come out with something like this, then Samsung -- and you and I -- will fall back into the category of losers and wannabes.\nIn the meantime, though, even the Best Buy sales bots admit that edge+ is what's bringing people in the door. Why they're interested in sending those phones out into the wild to make more converts is beyond me....which is why I'm thinking that they must be getting incentives for selling the Note.\nApologies again for the length of this, but I'm still a little traumatized.

That's right, Store 120. I'm talking about YOU. \nOne of the three salespeople indicated that they were all working for Samsung, or maybe he meant that they were working solely in the Samsung pavilion rather than this merely being their department. Samsung was in some sense or another their JOB. I'll give them this. They certainly knew what they were talking about. They all had a unique personal patter about what they do with the pen, with examples ready to show.\nWhat was really strange to me is that if they were so Samsung-y, why should they care which phone I bought? That's what made me wonder if they had some stake in selling more Notes.\nAs I've been thinking about this, I also wonder if Samsung isn't making more per unit on the Note. They've already amortized development costs for the Note, the parts costs are lower, so the margin is going to be higher than on a brand new, surely very expensive to manufacture new design.\nWho knows though? It sounds like my case was extreme. Maybe there really were just three random people who randomly landed in the California desert who wanted to sell me a Note 5 so badly that they kind of got offended when I chose the edge+. :-) Kidding aside, I really do have no idea what was going on.", "time": "09-10-2015 01:04 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4672686", "text": "Hi, I'm the OP. I actually decided to go back to the Edge plus. I felt that, since I wasn't using the S pen all that much, if at all, the Note 5 for me felt not too different from the Note 4 and Note 3. Obviously there are differences, but I felt like I just had the same overall experience. I couldn't stop playing with the gold platinum edge plus, and decided that I wanted to try something new this year. We'll see how long this lasts. Not a tremendous amount of functionality but a very fast, smooth and beautiful looking phone. As to your post, I can't tell you how many times my local Best Buy and various T-mobile stores have tried to push the Note5 over the edge plus. I've been told countless times by the reps, why do you want to take a step back and go to the edge plus from a Note 5? It's true, the Note5 really does do more. But I don't think the average consumer really cares about that. The s pen is an excellent powerhouse productivity tool. But in all honesty, how often will the average consumer need to mark up documents or doodle on pics or sign pdf's? Don't get me wrong, I'm sure these are great features that are used but it seems is a niche market imho.

I don't think you'll be able to find what your friend wants. CDMA is primarily used in the US, so you're probably stuck with getting the phone from Verizon, Sprint, or US Cellular.

Verizon doesn't carrier lock their phones any more: Device Unlocking Policy | Verizon Wireless.\nSprint also only carries the 32 GB gold S6 Edge+, but their unlock policy is a bit more involved--I don't know how many headache your friend might run into: Legal / Regulatory & Consumer Resources\nUS Cellular doesn't seem to have the 64 GB version, nor does it carry it in gold.\nThe phones should be compatible with both CDMA and GSM--see this article about the Verizon version: Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus (SM-G928V) certified by FCC, partial specs leak\nYou friend's best bet is probably to buy the Verizon 32 GB gold version outright, then activate it on whatever network he plans to use it on.

Said they are looking into the possibility of entire shipment from Samsung bad. I am including photos of my stats from today.\nI think a lot of Apps don't play well with the new phone and developers were not aware of this. One example is Escort Live, an App for the radar detector. There is no way to access the Settings Menu without going into phone settings>accessibility>dexterity & interaction>assistant menu. Escort said this caught them completely by surprise. This is just one example.\nAnyone using GO SMS Pro? On my phone it sucks %7.7 of all my power.

FIFTY FIVE CHARGING CYCLES! That's insane!\nThis phone is wack!\nRichard also told me my current phone temp was 89 degrees, wait now it's 90. Huh, come again?\nHeads up folks, maybe I'm late to this party, but I've been rooting and jailbreaking since 2009, and never encountered this. Verizon can monitor your phone in real time, view how many times you've charged it, the temperature, along with other info. They can see if you've EVER rooted your phone. If so, your warranty is void.\nOn a side note, a Samsung tech I spoke with this morning told me Samsung is offering an $8,000 bounty to the person who roots the Edge 6+. Samsung TS has been calling me every few days to check on how my battery is doing. Told them I'm not a happy camper.\nOf to the Verizon store to get another replacement phone.

This extraordinarily precise, highly automated draw process produces a thin sheet cover glass with pristine surface quality, outstanding optical clarity and inherent dimensional stability \u2013 qualities essential for cover glass for consumer applications.\nThe process begins when raw materials are blended into a glass composition, which is melted and conditioned. The molten glass is fed into a trough called an \u201cisopipe,\u201d overfilling until the glass flows evenly over both sides. It then rejoins, or fuses, at the bottom, where it is drawn down to form a continuous sheet of flat glass that is so thin it is measured in microns. The glass is untouched by human hands or anything else that will introduce flaws into the surface.\nThis same fusion process is at the heart of Corning\u2019s industry-leading LCD glass. The composition of Corning\u00ae Gorilla\u00ae Glass enables a deep layer of chemical strengthening through an ion-exchange process where individual glass parts are cut from the \u201cmother sheet\u201d and undergo an ion-exchange process.\nION-EXCHANGE PROCESS\nIon exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \u201cstuffed\u201d into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior. The glass is placed in a hot bath of molten salt at a temperature of approximately 400 degrees C. Smaller sodium ions leave the glass, and larger potassium ions from the salt bath replace them. These large ions take up more room and are pressed together when the glass cools, producing a layer of compressive stress on the surface of the glass. Gorilla Glass\u2019 composition enables the potassium ions to diffuse far into the surface, creating high compressive stress deep into the glass. This layer of compression creates the surface that is more resistant to damage.\nCorning\u2019s innovations don\u2019t end on the manufacturing floor. One of Corning's greatest strengths is our focus on developing the technology behind the glass. Our research has delivered such life-changing innovations as the glass envelope for Edison's light bulb, the glass envelope for cathode ray picture tubes (CRTs) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), as well as the first low-loss optical fiber capable of use in telecommunications. We continue to investigate new glass compositions and process innovations at our three major research facilities: Sullivan Park in Corning New York; Corning Technology Center in Shizuoka Japan; Corning Research Center Taiwan in Hsinchu, Taiwan.\nScientists in these facilities work closely with the Gorilla Glass commercial, engineering, and manufacturing staff to anticipate industry trends and deliver new or improved glass technologies that add value to customers\u2019 products and processes. Through this ongoing process, Corning Gorilla Glass continues to lead through glass technology innovation in the fast-paced consumer electronics industry.\nFAQ\nHOW IS CORNING\u00ae GORILLA\u00ae GLASS 3 DIFFERENT?\nGorilla Glass 3 with Native Damage Resistance enables improved damage resistance and toughness. This new glass composition helps prevent the deep scratches that can lead to glass failure. The result is improved scratch resistance, reduced scratch visibility and improved retained strength if a scratch occurs.\nWHAT IS NATIVE DAMAGE RESISTANCE\u2122?\nGorilla Glass 3 with Native Damage Resistance offers improvements in the glass composition at the atomic level -- making the glass better able to withstand deep scratches and cracks that can weaken glass performance. This improvement enhances the retained strength of the glass and its ability to withstand damage.\nWHY DO I WANT GORILLA GLASS ON MY DEVICES?\nScrapes and bumps are a fact of life, but Gorilla Glass enables your device to resist damage from the abuses that come with everyday use. Gorilla Glass also has strong aesthetic appeal. It\u2019s thin, lightweight, and cool to the touch \u2013 enabling the sleekest designs.\nCAN YOU EXPLAIN THE ION-EXCHANGE PROCESS?\nIon exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \u201cstuffed\u201d into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior. The glass is placed in a hot bath of molten salt at a temperature of approximately 400\u00b0C. Smaller sodium ions leave the glass, and larger potassium ions from the salt bath replace them. These larger ions take up more room and are pressed together when the glass cools, producing a layer of compressive stress on the surface of the glass. Gorilla Glass\u2019s special composition enables the potassium ions to diffuse far into the surface, creating high compressive stress deep into the glass. This layer of compression creates a surface that is more resistant to damage from everyday use.\nWHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT?\nThe unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \u201carmor,\u201d making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant.\nHOW DO I KNOW IF GORILLA GLASS IS ON MY DEVICE?\nGorilla Glass is currently used by more than 33 major brands, designed into hundreds of product models, and featured on more than 1.5 billion devices. Check out this list for the most current, comprehensive collection of devices that Corning can confirm for Gorilla Glass.\nDOES THIS LIST INCLUDE ALL DEVICES THAT HAVE GORILLA GLASS?\nNo, unfortunately, customer agreements prevent us from identifying all the devices that feature Gorilla Glass. This list shows all devices we can talk about. We\u2019ll continue to update the list as customers allow us to share that information.\nCAN I BREAK GORILLA GLASS?\nIf subjected to enough abuse, Gorilla Glass can break. However, Gorilla Glass is better able to survive the real-world events that most commonly cause glass to scratch, chip, or break.\nI LIKE THE IDEA OF GREATER DAMAGE RESISTANCE, BUT WON\u2019T GORILLA GLASS ADD BULK TO MY DEVICE?\nCorning\u2019s ion-exchange process makes Gorilla Glass exceptionally durable, while allowing it to remain thin and lightweight enough to enable the sleekest smartphones and slates. Gorilla Glass can be produced at a thinness of 0.5 millimeters just four times thicker than a human hair.\nIS IT TRUE THAT GORILLA GLASS WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED IN THE 1960S?\nNo. That has been a popular myth, which apparently resulted from a misunderstanding of the facts. It\u2019s true that Corning experimented with chemically strengthened glass in 1960, as part of an initiative called \u201cProject Muscle.\u201d In 1961, Corning developed a glass composition it promoted under the Chemcor\u00ae brand, which featured state-of-the-art strength and durability. Chemcor glass was incorporated into tableware, ophthalmic products, and applications for the automotive, aviation, and pharmaceutical industries. When Corning began developing a tough new cover glass for electronic devices in 2006, Corning scientists, of course, drew upon the company\u2019s prior expertise with strengthened glass. However, Corning Gorilla Glass is a different product and glass composition than Chemcor. We implemented significant compositional as well as other changes to achieve superior product characteristics including outstanding damage resistance, while making the glass compatible with Corning\u2019s proprietary fusion-draw manufacturing process. Corning\u2019s fusion-draw process produces exceptionally thin glass with unparalleled surface quality. The result is a tough and damage-resistant glass that is ideal for today\u2019s sleekest electronic devices and most sophisticated touch technology.\nIS GORILLA GLASS RECYCLABLE?\nYes. Gorilla Glass can be recycled using standard glass recycling programs.\nWILL I PAY MORE FOR MY MOBILE DEVICE IF IT CONTAINS GORILLA GLASS VERSUS SODA LIME GLASS?\nCorning sells to device manufacturers. Pricing for Gorilla Glass is based on manufacturer-specific product requirements (e.g., thickness, size) and volume. We can\u2019t speculate on what that might mean for the retail price of a particular device.\nWHERE IS GORILLA GLASS MADE?\nCorning manufactures Gorilla Glass in the United States, Japan, and Taiwan.\nWHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF CORNING\u2019S FUSION DRAW PROCESS?\nCorning\u2019s proprietary fusion process creates an unparalleled surface quality. This extraordinarily precise, highly automated process produces glass with exceptionally clean, smooth, flat surfaces; outstanding optical clarity; and inherent dimensional stability. With the right process design, the glass can be used \u201cas drawn,\u201d eliminating grinding and polishing processes that add cost and may introduce surface flaws. This same fusion draw process is at the heart of Corning\u2019s industry-leading LCD glass.\nWHAT\u2019S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GORILLA GLASS AND CORNING\u2019S LCD GLASS SUBSTRATES?\nThey serve different purposes: Gorilla Glass is a cover glass for the exterior of display devices, while EAGLE XG\u00ae is a glass substrate used within liquid crystal display panels. Therefore, many electronic devices feature both Corning Gorilla Glass and EAGLE XG. While they are formed with the same manufacturing process, the chemical compositions of the glass are also different. EAGLE XG LCD glass is an aluminosilicate composition, while Gorilla Glass is an alkali-aluminosilicate glass.\nI HEARD THAT GORILLA GLASS IS GOING TO BE USED FOR APPLICATIONS AND PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF CONSUMER ELECTRONICS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THAT?\nGorilla Glass\u2019s unique combination of beauty and durability offers benefits for applications beyond consumer electronics, and Corning\u2019s research team is exploring the possibilities. Stay tuned for more information about where Gorilla Glass may appear next.\nDOES CORNING SUPPORT THE DIAN FOSSEY GORILLA FUND INTERNATIONAL?\nYes. In October 2011, Corning Incorporated became an official sponsor of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International through an initial cash donation. Corning was proud to announce its continued support of the organization through an additional donation on October 3, 2012. Corning\u2019s contributions support the organization\u2019s ongoing efforts to conserve and protect gorillas and their habitats in Africa.

The camera on that phone is terrific, with a simple interface and consistently good photo quality under most conditions. I never thought another Smartphone camera would give it a run for its money.\nThe Samsung S6 series definitely has! After using both phones, I can say without hesitation that the camera on the S6 (and now the Edge+ since it's basically the same) are a step above the iPhone camera. The most obvious notably step up is in sensor resolution. But we all know by now that megapixels aren't everything. In fact, a general rule of thumb has been that the higher the megapixel count, the lower the low light photo quality. And this is usually true if all other things are equal. But Samsung has managed to have a higher megapixel sensor AND still maintain very good low light capability. Part of this is due to image processing, another part is due to its very fast lens, and finally it's also a very good sensor. Having more megapixels means potentially more detail, and more leeway when cropping.\nWith its very fast lens, the S6 series is terrific in low light. One glaring example of the S6's superiority over the iPhone 6/6 Plus is in its low-light video recording. Try shooting an identical scene with both photos and notice that the S6 video is brighter - partly due to its faster lens, but perhaps also because of its image processing and sensitivity. Plus, I think the OIS is just better on the Samsung as well.\nFurthermore, the camera app itself is much better on the S6 series than on the iPhone. SUre, the iPhone camera app is simple to use and very quick. But it lacks many of the features that the S6 series camera app has. Basically, you can just do a lot more, including a Pro mode. Plus now you can Live Stream to Youtube directly from the camera app. Did I mention the S6 series shoots in 4K video? Has a cool video collage mode?\nHow is the camera? It's superb! Is there room for improvement? Of course, we still have a long way to go to reach the level of a high end point and shoot.

Anyway, I've been using an iPhone 6 since September while playing with my old HTC One M8 on the side. Then a few months ago, I sent my M8 to my daughter who was in need of a phone. So I'm in the Apple ecosystem pretty much exclusively at that point other than my work laptop. But I always kept an eye on Android and wondered when I would come back. Read many articles and blogs every day to keep up with the landscape.\nSo last week, my company replaces my old iPhone 5 with an iPhone 6 so that I was then carrying two IP6's. That was all it took. Waited anxiously for the release date (today), then went out at lunch and picked up the GS6E+. I haven't had a lot of time with it yet, but what I have, I'm thrilled. I am psyched for the weekend to start so I can play with it.\nI kept my personal iPhone 6 just in case I have problems with the E+ and need to take it back. But if it goes as well as I hope, I'll be selling my iPhone in the near future. I'll still have my work iPhone to mess around with, but I'll be having fun with my Galaxy most of the time.\nBTW, I'm not a fanboy of any particular ecosystem...I'm just a gadget geek who likes to be on the cutting edge and likes to mix things up. After giving my M8 to my daughter, that was the first time in 5 years I had not had an Android device of some time...usually as my daily driver.

Personally, I do not want to turn off anything on my phone just to save battery life. In my view, that defeats the view of using Android, and unless it's specifically something I don't use, I leave everything on. For example, I like Location Reporting by Google because I like looking at my Timeline to see where I've been each day (especially now that my photos are placed in the timeline by location as well, this is very nifty). Likewise, I resist using Battery Saver modes because they have some sort of compromise, whether it's a dimmer screen, throttled performance, or disabled background notifications. I like all of those things, and I'd rather have to charge my battery a little more often to have them enabled.\nBut really, now that I've had the phone for about a week now, I am very pleased with the battery life. No, it's still not iPhone 6 Plus lasting, but it's significantly better than the regular S6 I was using before. That phone I had to charge at least two times per day. With my Edge+, I use it for part of the day and then I top it off about half way through the day so I can make it until bedtime. The fast charging is so good that I don't mind having to put it on the charger for a short time to top it off.\nDon't let battery life hold you back from switching from the iPhone to the Edge+. I like almost everything better about this phone over my iPhone 6 Plus. Screen is much better, charging is much faster, camera is actually better and has more features, going to have Samsung Pay which will work with more merchants than Apple Pay (unless you buy that new dongle thingy), has much more RAM so you don't have to reload browser tabs as often, and Android is honestly less buggy and more fluid than iOS now in many regards. I have really become disgruntled with iOS the last year or two because they have had a lot of bugs and things that just don't work right. I still love the iPhone, and there are some things it still does better at (battery life is one of them). But this Edge+ is serious competition for the iPhone 6 Plus. Then again, Apple's 6S Plus is right around the corner!

Knowing that both the Note 5 and the Edge+ have basically same main options and features than the S6 and S6 edge, they may also help you.\nAt least try this 5 tweaks or hints that if worked on the S6 must work here too.\n-Report diagnostic Info - It has been reported by some users that turning this off helps preventing wakelocks, turning it off doesn't seem to affect anything. Go to Settings- Privacy and safety.\nAlso, go to Settings- Lock Screen and Security- Other Security settings , turn off Send Security Reports.\n- Some new reports and tests have shown that for some people with Standby drain issues disabling ANT+ Plugins service and ANT Radio Service has helped a lot. Look for both in Application Manager in the All or Downloaded tabs. \n- A new option that was fixed with 5.1.1 update- if you go to Settings-Battery there is a Detail button, if you enter there, you can Auto Stop ALL apps that you don't need to be running in the background once you close it, it should definitely helps on standby time. If you decide to use but, just remember to not auto stop apps that you need to run in the background for notifications or any other purposes. If you need more info about it, check this article.\nAccording to a user on the S6 forum, after latest update the Auto Stop on some model variants was moved from the Battery menu to the RAM Management app. Look overthere if you can't find it on the battery settings. Can't tell you if ATT and Verizon left it untouched.\n- Download Doze app, https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...KkCsW0edzggsgI, and just add to the Active list the apps you want tonkeep notifying you or simply keep working on the background for any reason.\n-Location and Location History -\nGoogle has made some changes that has affected ALL Android devices since about 4 months, first, they removed Location Reporting, so now having Location History on, means that you have both services running in the background, and right now one of the main battery drainer as it pings your devices every few minutes and you can't stop it, just by turning Location History off.\nPeople need to understand that our devices comes with EVERYTHING on by default, dozens of Google apps and services that you may never use, then Samsung add dozens more and to make thing worse, then the carriers do the same, if you think you can leave everything as it comes by default and get great battery life, sorry, but not real unless you have a 3500mHa battery or greater and that just give you a little more time if you don't make some tweaks.\nFor those of you that would like to enjoy a lot more this great device and don't have any issues making a couple of tweaks here and there to get the best battery life possible, check the S6 forum and look for my thread, you'll see easily there as it's the one with the more posts, just an advise, in addition to what I suggested yesterday, I'd add that if you can turn Location off until you need it, use those quick toggles, it takes you a second to turn them off or on, but if you want your location on for other services, use the Power Saving Mode (WiFi and Cell signal only) until you need a pinpoint Location like in using Google maps, then just switch the mode back. You won't believe the amount of people that just have Location on just to have the Weather widget working, they don't realize that you can turn the current location option off and just enter manually your city or cities and it will do just the same but Saving a good amount of battery life in the process.\nOn this topic, it's simply not fair to compare Android in general with iOS, add iOS controls every single aspect of those background apps and Android just love to have everything running in the background all the time, to be a fair comparisons, tweaks must be done and adding the Doze app and Auto Stop features on the 5.1.1 version it tweaks our phone to be more like what iOS do their stuff.

I too jump back and forth between iOS and Android as my daily driver. I used the iPhone 6 Plus from September of last year up until a couple months ago. Now I'm using the S6 Edge+ on AT&T as my daily driver. I still have the iPhone and a Nexus 6.

I pretty much preferred the old, dedicated switch, too. \nNow, the Location Services is the 'Master Switch' for all things location, but if you go to Location Settings (or long press on the Location toggle) you can select to use location only with tower data (GPS off) by selecting the Medium or Low accuracy method. If you select the High Accuracy one, then it'll use GPS. However, things have gotten smarter now, and GPS isn't actually on all the time, only when an app is polling for location.", "time": "08-24-2015 12:24 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4631827", "text": "Thanks for the reply!\nSo, to my understanding, the 'Locating method' is just the way and the extent that your location is determined? Why, for example, would I want to choose high accuracy? When is it good for? Right now, I have 'GPS only' checked. Also, if I am at home, connected to my WiFi, would there be any added benefit to having 'Location' on? Or can my location be retrieved via WiFi?\nYou also mention that Location Services serves as a 'master switch'. If I turn this off, that means that GPS is off, and in addition, I cannot get information from apps such as weather? Or since I have 'GPS only' checked, when I turn off 'Location', GPS will be turned off but location services will remain? I'm still a bit confused. Usually (when I had my M8) I would only turn on GPS for when I was going off of the maps app on my phone for directions...is this the same thing as turning on 'Location' on?\nFinally, as a comment, this is why a stand-alone GPS button would be better in my opinion, as you could be able to have location services turned on for apps that require it (like weather), but have GPS turned off so it doesn't hog the battery.", "time": "08-24-2015 12:41 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4632055", "text": "If you leave only GPS checked, nope, your location will not be able to be retrieved either using WiFi information or mobile network tower info. It will always try to use GPS to get your location when an app polls for it. \nYup, if you switch Location Services off, as long as the app is properly coded and 'reads' the state of this switch, it won't be able to get a location. Some weather apps will default to the last known location or if you set a fixed city instead of Current Location. The location method you selected is only active if the Location Services master switch is active. If not, all location methods are off. \nFor your maps question, nope. If you turn Location Services on, you can still use maps, but unless you select either the GPS only or GPS + WiFi + Cell Data, you won't get a high-accuracy pinpoint and most apps will block navigation until you activate GPS (there should be a warning message saying so and taking you to your location settings if you try to do it). Here if you turn location services off, it won't give you your location in maps, but the degree of accuracy of said location and the services available from the maps app will depend on which method you selected. Also remember, that now, even if you have Location Services on all the time, if no app is polling for location (you turn off all Weather app pollings, you're not actively using maps or navigation, you've turned off location history for Google, etc.), even if you selected to use GPS + WiFi + Cell Data, none of these are actually used (and therefore GPS is actually off) until an app polls for your location. \nFor your final comment, I agree. I do prefer the standalone GPS button, too. But in Android's defense, their management has been greatly improved so now it shouldn't affect your battery life all that much. You can test drive it, for instance, if you use your phone for one day with GPS + WiFi + Cell Data and then one day with WiFi + Cell Data only... as long as your daily usage remains somewhat the same, you shouldn't see that much of a difference in battery drain from location services.", "time": "08-24-2015 02:09 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4632327", "text": "Wow!

I'm glad I kept the Nexus 6, if only to play around with the latest versions of Android, but I would always choose the Edge+ over the Nexus 6 for my daily driver. Here's why:\n1) Camera. The camera sensor on the Nexus 6 is decent, and it can take a good photo. But the camera app stinks, the focusing is terrible when shooting video, and it lacks the features of the Samsung camera app. The Edge+ is much better in low light as well. The camera app interface has a much better design, more features, and is much faster to use. The camera is very important to me, and it's the primary reason I just cannot use the Nexus 6 as my daily driver.\n2) Fingerprint Sensor. I've gotten spoiled using a fingerprint sensor - first with the iPhone 6 Plus - and now with the latest Samsung phones. It's at least on par with the iPhone and perhaps even higher accuracy. I just can't imagine using a phone (either iPhone or Android) without a fingerprint scanner now as my daily driver. It makes unlocking the phone so much nicer, and it's going to be increasingly more important for mobile payments, etc. Of course, the latest Nexus coming out will probably have one, so that may be better competition for the Edge+/Note 5.\n3) Screen. The Nexus 6 screen is very good, actually, but Samsung is just better with display technology. The screen on the Edge+ is higher resolution, gets much brighter in daylight, and doesn't have that distracting tint at low brightness. Plus, I really like the Edge screen.\nOne area that the Nexus 6 does shine is with Android itself. Though the skin on the latest Galaxy phones is much improved over previous iterations, I'd still take stock Android over it (except for the camera app). Running the Android M preview on my Nexus 6 has been enjoyable, and except for a few bugs and incompatible apps, is really fluid and enjoyable to use.", "time": "08-24-2015 12:13 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Screen has a light blue tint to it when i tilt it!", "thread": [{"postID": "post4629628", "text": "Anytime my phone is tilted down or forward the screen it has a light blue tint in it but i dont see it when is straight up and im looking at it.

Those phone batteries get hot. \nAlso, If you keep your phone from going below 20% it will go a long way in preserving battery life.", "time": "08-19-2015 08:26 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4620591", "text": "I thought it was good to charge when the battery is very low and bad to charge when it was at say 50%.

I had some trouble getting it activated though: the online activation said \"failed\" so I had to call a CSR. The first CSR could not activate the device either, stating some kind of problem with the \"features\" of the data plan for the device. She had to transfer me to a different department. This time I was on the phone for almost an hour as she and a supervisor fiddled with getting it activated. Well they finally did and it's working great now!\nSo far I love the phone. I have a regular Galaxy S6 that I've been using for a little while now, but I'll be selling that now that I have the Edge+. I felt the Edge+ had everything I was looking for: larger screen, top of the line camera, better battery life than my S6 (though probably not much), the Edge screen (I didn't get the Edge initially because I found a really good deal on an unlocked regular S6), and the fast wireless charging (currently waiting for Samsung to get it in stock).\nThe one thing I cannot get to work is the Live Youtube Streaming from the camera app. When I select the Live streaming mode from the camera app, it asks me to sign in to my Youtube account. It pops up a little mini browser. I put in my Google creds and it does the 2-factor authentication thingy and gives me a code. That works, and it says my Youtube account is enabled for Live streaming. But as soon as I close the little mini browser, the signin pops back up again. I cannot get this to stop. I tried closing the camera app, rebooting the phone, signing out of Youtube and back in again, but nothing seems to work. Not sure if there's an authentication problem between the camera app and Youtube, or perhaps the Live streaming isn't working yet?\nAnyway, loving the phone!", "time": "08-18-2015 12:58 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4616691", "text": "Congrats!

Using Android Smartlock I feel like I won't really need it, but if it's incredibly good I might.\nSmall thing- Is there a quick setting option to toggle mobile data on/off baked into TouchWiz?
