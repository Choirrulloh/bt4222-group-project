I lost out on that deal because I waited until the next morning. I am still kicking myself over it.

My Nexus 6p is brand new so I'm trying to find one in the same condition and that comes in the original box with all contents. I prefer the X Performance but I'll go for the X too. Not really too sure if many people out there ever bought many of these two models but I've owned the X before and I miss the 5 inch display on it. I hate to let my new Nexus 6p go as it was hard to find complete brand new but when you get your mind on one it's hard to let go. I'd rather get my hands on the X Performance just because I've not owned it before but I know all my cases will fit it from when I had my X. The one I missed out on was new in box for only $178. I just figured no one would buy it over night and I'd buy it the next morning but when I went to purchase it, she was gone. It was the white model just like I wanted too. Hopefully I'll locate the X Performance since it's on par with my Nexus 6p in terms of processor and overall performance. If not I'll just keep my beloved 6p as it's one of my all time favorite phones. The X Performance and regular X were both so over priced when they first released it was crazy. Now they both are much better in line in terms of pricing. Anyone out there have the X Performance? How fast is it. Any lag on that one at all? Is the screen resolution the same with both models? I know the X runs a 650 and I think the performance runs a 820? Anyways check my post out on the market place if you have one of these two models in the original box and it's in like new condition as mine is. Mine is only 5 days old so it's still new. Would be a good trade for someone. My 6p is running 8.0 Oreo already with a security update as recent as to of yesterday. If I can't find a trade for one of these two models where is the best place to buy them at? Amazon? Also or lastly haven't both of these models been discontinued? How much longer will Sony support updates to these two devices. Like my 6p has a whole nother year left. I'm skeptical of letting my 6p go for one but I miss my X so I really want to locate a performance if all possible and do a even trade. If it's an X cash would have to come my way and I'd rather just keep it an even trade. Best buy used to sell these but I don't see them anymore on their site. What happened to this line?

I haven't used the V10 before either so can't really give you a good gauge.\nIf you want a smaller phone, this is a great choice. The specs might seem a bit underwhelming, but the nougat update did wonders for the phone. The UI responsiveness is actually really good, and performance is pretty decent too. It's something that I can definitely live with comfortably for the apps that I use.\nI like Sony's UI too since it's pretty clean, and sony is pretty on the ball when it comes to updates. It got 7.0 like early this year, and was updated to 7.1.1 recently. Mine's running the July security patch.\nThere are a few things to take note too though. The speakers isn't really the loudest I've heard, and screen protector can be a bit challenging to find, especially if you're looking for glass ones. The glossy plastic back shell picks up hairline marks really easily which is to be expected, so just have to take note of that.\nSo yeah, i'll definitely still recommend one if you can find one for a good deal.

This X is a top end mid range phone and my research leads me to find that it's comparable to the iPhone 6s in pretty much all aspects which for me personally, I find to be perfect. I'm about to set it up and will report back shortly if indeed it stands up to compare to the Apple 6s which I happen to know quite deeply. Stand by and I'll be back shortly with a detailed short review of my thoughts.
