My wife uses P9 for about 6 months and here I started looking towards this Huawei device and comparing it to my old phone. I know it's a P10 thread, but we are talking about EMUI. Well, yes it looks like someone was designing Android based OS which still has to look like iOS. But in general experience is smooth. Behavior of basic parts of the system is the same (notifications, phone configurations etc.). It just visually looks different. For me switching to EMUI would be a trade-off. I'll tell you why: \r\n- EMUI manages battery life amazingly (plus, battery capacity isn't too small itself)  \r\n- Device has a rich featured camera (night shot, time lapse, bokeh effect and many more) \r\n- P10 just looks great. \n \r\nSo, in the wake of that EMUI becomes a quite OK-ish operating system to use.

You could open a ticket with Huawei to report this issue and hope you'll get a positive response (either It's a feature ! You just have to do the following, or We look forward to fix this soon !).\n \r\nOtherwise, I may suggest you to install a third party application that does a workaround of this problem.

If you don't remove it OR put another cover if this plastic one doesn't suit your need, I don't think it'll be a problem. I wouldn't recommend peeling off the plastic protector that's already on the screen. I bought a glass protector, but I regret removing it since day one lol. It fits a lot better than most plastic/glass protectors you'll find and it is of good quality. I don't know how the recent P10 are manufactured now, but maybe they fixed the oleophobic issue. \r\n- overheating : I don't think you'll have that much of a problem with heat considering the activities you stated... it will heat up a little, but I doubt it'll be anywhere near levels which are uncomfortable or affecting performance. Putting a case on your phone may help cover the heating part. I know I don't notice it that much since I've put a case around it.  \r\n- EMUI : Emui is a very clean looking Android OS. Most of the themes I tried keeps that cleanliness intact and it is possible to get something close to stock as look and feel (through third party app... I'm thiking about SimpleFlat and SimpleO themes if you want to google them). I don't see stock android any better or worse than EMUI, just different. As someone who ALWAYS root/mod/reinstall stock on my previous phones, the thought never occured to me to do this with EMUI. It's just good as is and it has interesting features !

My nephew who is 9 years old and is a very heavy user, plays Clash Royale every available moment  he gets (a little scary at times) owns a Homtom HT17 Pro 4G Phablet that cost on Ali Baba about 80$, the game runs perfectly so you can imagine the frustration!\n \r\nSo, I did some tests and used all benchmark apps, with the appropriate instructions and ran them.

When you look at the phone while the test is working, you can see it's not working well.\n \r\nThe app said that my results are very bad for the hardware and I should clean the ram and wait for the device to cool down and try again (Average result is around 1870 for P10). When I saw tests done from other youtubers, I saw that they got 2200+ and one other got 2680, that\u00c2\u0092s more than x2 my result. \n \r\nAfter speaking to Huawei\u00c2\u0092s customer service department, which was absolutely useless, I decided to go to Huawei Official lab, where they said that they do not know how to test it    (O M G) and will contact Huawei Global to see how they can test it.\n \r\nThey also told me that if they don't find anything wrong, I will have to pay for the lab tests!!! \r\nSo\u00c2\u0085not only do they not know how to test it, they will also charge money for their ignorance!\n \r\nI saw a picture on their wall stating that P10 is better than iPhone 7, I have an iPhone 7 and I ran same 3dMarks testing and got 2160 and told them about it and their response was \r\n\u00c2\u0093What do you expect, its iPhone 7\u00c2\u0094.\n \r\nEven at their official lab they stated that, the phone is bad compared to other flagships. \r\nOn top of it all, the customer service told me that my new phone will be fixed and not replaced because that's their policy. \r\nNow can you imagine, buying a new phone, it does not work properly and they offer to fix it for you?

I must say, it's gorgeous to hold and look at; light and fits well in the hand. I'll list the prositives:\n \r\n1. Screen size is just about right (for me that is) and is bright enough \r\n2. Battery will last through the day and then some if you are a light user. Heavy users will just have the day and a bit. Batter charging is very fast especially if it's 49% and below. You may not notice the 'super fast charging' if it's above 50% \r\n3. The camera is wonderful. Performs as expected especially during the day. Quality night time shooting will require a bit of tweaking the in-built camera app (Pro Mode) to get the best shots. My advice is take time to learn a bit of photography to get the best shots possible \r\n4. EMUI ver.5 is good. I'm a new user to the user interface and I find it easy to navigate. I have not enabled the App drawer and hence I have all my apps on the screen (like iPhone) \r\n5. The navigation 'button' will take a while (depends on how comfortable one is with it) to get used to (switching between apps and closing apps). A couple of days use for me was sufficient to leave it as the only button and for go the on-screen keys \r\n6. The fingerprint sensor (also doubles as the navigation 'button') is super fast. I hardly notice I have the sensor enabled. Its easy to use since one can store up to 5 fingers. For me I have a couple of the both left and right fingers. Note, every 3 days as a security measure, the phone requires one to enter the PIN number. It isn't bothersome; just something to do \r\n7. I have not experienced any lags, so the phone is smooth when switching between apps of screens \r\n8. I am based in East Africa (bought the phone locally and have the requisite version for this region) and yesterday (15-08-2017) received an update (VTR-L29C185B163, 529MB). It mostly dealt with battery optimization (for power consumption), Goolge security patches and twin app patches\n \r\nThe negative aspects of the phone...I'm still looking\n \r\nAll in all, I'd give this phone an 8/10 rating due to a combination of factors, namely: price (bought it for $ 475), size, camera, and smooth and quick operation. Would I recommend it to anyone? Yes I would...again and again (my girlfriend wants one!), though I'm not in an authoritative position to advice one which to pick between the P10 and another phone\n \r\nThanks", "date": "16 Aug 2017"}, {"text": "Good phone.

A lot of the new phones now come with a small cooling strip which are designed to contain some liquid or gas fluid to help thermal throttling which happens with processors restricting performance to cool down the phone at certain temperatures. This was the case since the snapdragon 810, possibly the worst chip ever made by Qualcomm.
