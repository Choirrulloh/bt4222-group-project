There was almost a week left to my warranty. So i visited local service centre where they told me that they will check the device and see if they could replace the screen. They gave me receipt but it didn't mentioned the \"JOB SHEET NUMBER\" (as it was my first time to submit a phone in sony service centre, so i wasn't familiar about it) and they told me that it would take a week. After the week passed, i directly called the Customer Care to check the status of my device and they asked for the JOB SHEET NUMBER which was not given to me, so the Customer Care told me to contact local service centre to get the number. So i called the service centre and asked for JOB SHEET NUMBER, but they said that \"THE JOB SHEET NUMBER IS NOT BEING GENERATED FOR EVERYONE\" which after i researched was a lame excuse. So i got the call from service centre on jan 29 that my phone is ready to pick. When i enquired what was the problem? They said, \"THE MOTHERBOARD, CHARGING PORT AND DISPLAY HAS BEEN REPLACED\" (ok i understand why display was replaced, but why the heck was motherboard and charging port replaced?). \n \r\nWhen i picked the device i was shocked. The condition of the device was so bad that i had a feeling that this can't be my device. The metallic sides were scratched so bad (very deep scratches) and the entire back panel had deep scratches and it had marks of fingers like the device was being used without back cover or any protection for very long. The same case was with camera lens, it was badly scratched as well. \r\nWhen enquired about the bad condition, we had an argument which after he changed the metallic sides and said that they don't have back panel and camera lens available rightnow and agreed to get it it fixed. \r\nWhen i reached home i tried to insert the sim card and when i pulled the sim tray (simcard holder), it was cracked. The thing that shocked me was that this wasn't the simtray my phone had, because my simtray had a little mark on it, which it didn't have.\n \r\nOn Jan 2nd, The guy at service centre informed me to get back cover replaced as it arrived today and after reaching there, i told him to pull off the back cover in front of me (i had already watched a video \"how to dessemble xa\" on YouTube). So when he pulled the back cover off, i saw there was no \"COPPER LAYER ON BOARD\" which is supposed to reduce heat from chips and i was shocked to see the \"DENTS\" on the motherboard, the question is IF THEY REPLACED THE MOTHERBOARD WITH NEW ONE WHY DOES IT HAS REPAIR TRACES? (I took a pic of it but don't know hpw to upload it here). So it's clear that the service centre guy just replaced my new phone with old one and and after emails, calls and visiting service centre again and again (even though it's around 40 KMs away from my home), neither sony nor service centre is helping me. \n \r\nFROM 2 TO 3 DAYS MY DEVICE STUTTERS (LAGS) WHILE SCROLLING WEBPAGES AND VIEWING PICTURES IN ALBUM, which I'm definitely sure wasn't there before. \n \r\nCan anyone please help me what should i do now?

XA is one of the best looking Sony phone. You got bezelless sides and it does not look like a cheap generic phone. Sony phones are uniquely designed unlike other brands that look like (you know what brands). My friends thought it was a premium device lol. And XA has gorilla glass 4 (Source: Sony support forum). \r\n- Display and Performance. The 720p display is enough for me. Super-vivid mode makes the images and videos saturated. The 720p display and processor combination makes this phone super fast and fluid. \r\n- Camera. Under daylight, it is one of the best cameras in the midrange segment.

Version 33.2.A.3.81 improved the battery life. \r\n- You may opt to do a software repair through Xperia Companion (PC Software) if the problem still insists. \r\n- There's also a bug stated a while ago about Wi-Fi Scanning. Click Settings > Location > Click the three dots > Turn off both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning. (This was already fixed, I think). \r\n- Turn on STAMINA mode all the time. \r\n- Turn off Wi-Fi, bluetooth, auto-rotation, auto-sync when not needed. \r\n- Enable Smart Back light control and Auto brightness \r\n- Disable image enhancements (Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2 or Super-vivid mode) \r\n- Disable keep Wi-Fi on during sleep. \r\n- Do not play graphic intensive games for too long, let the phone rest when it heats up. \r\n- Do not take many consecutive shots with the camera, take a few shots and let it rest when it heats up. \r\n- There's also a bug called \"Mobile Radio Active\" common in most android phones. Turn on \"Airplane mode\" when possible especially when you're going to sleep.\n \r\n- Please do take note that this phone has about 5 hours screen-on time and lasts about 1 day on normal usage because of the small battery capacity (2300 mAh). \r\n- You may or may not do all the tips stated above, do what is applicable. \r\n- Also, I read somewhere that the battery life increases by about 20% after 10 charging cycles.\n \r\n- Source: Sony Support Forum, Sony Xperia XA user for 2 months :)", "date": "06 Jan 2017"}, {"text": "Any tips on how to imorove its battery life?

Did you manage to get a screen guard that fits well? ", "date": "13 Dec 2016"}, {"text": "This is an excellent phone. After one month of using it, here's my opinion about XA: \r\n+ The design feels premium. I love the bezel-less display and the shiny metal frame. The back is very clean and attractive. This phone is also surprisingly thin, but the top and bottom bezels felt empty. \r\n+ The display (although at 720p) is good. The colors are vibrant, and there's Mobile Bravia Engine 2 or Super-vivid mode enhancements to further improve the display. There's also some touchscreen issues that make swiping downward to view notifications fail most of the time. \r\n+ The camera was excellent with object tracking ability (and that camera shutter button). It works best in good lighting conditions, but struggles in low light (as opposed to what Sony advertises). The camera was also sluggish in focusing to a subject giving you blurred shots sometimes. I always take 2 to 3 shots of a subject to get a clear picture. The AR effects were really enjoyable. \r\n+ Sound is also good, but you might need to use earphones when viewing Youtube videos because the speaker is very quiet even at MAX volume. When listening to Music and Videos, the speaker is clear and the loudness is acceptable. Turn on ClearAudio+, Dynamic Normalizer, and set your Headphone settings for best results (MH410 was the earphones provided with the device).  \r\n+ The performance is smooth, but there's some sluggishness in navigation. The phone can handle most games easily, but it also somewhat hates being used in gaming (the phone heats up after some time and drains battery relatively fast). Updating the phone to the latest version takes half of your internal storage so a microSD card is necessary. \r\n+ Lastly, the battery is okay depending on usage. My phone lasts for 9-12 hours of normal usage, and 2-6 hours of heavy usage. When I don't have classes I turn on Airplane mode and the phone lasts for about 1.5 days. If you want to increase battery life, turn on Stamina mode all the time. The phone also charges fast with the provided charger.\n \r\nTip: Install apps from Sony Mobile in Play Store.

I found other reviews lying but I can find certain applications causing them but it is not a common mobile problem. It is caused because those applications are not meant to be running smooth on XA. For example I have been playing a lot of SimCity Online, while I am Offline no overheating and drains slowly, while Online it goes down more than just 20% per 1 hour and gets to 34\u00b0C (hot), once I played so long I got to 39\u00b0C (very hot) so I had to stop for a moment. Besides that I think SimCity is running on the background, my antivirus program told me it is draining 14% which on that day did, but today for example my battery took only 1% during 8 hours so I am not sure why my battery went so quickly down. But I am sure that online gaming is not recommended, otherwise you will have to recharge every day, offline gaming is different subject where you have plenty on screen time. Watching YouTube, listening music and browsing web is at the similar draining level, no overheating issue. The big problem is installing (especially updates), while I installed few games it was OK, installing updates caused overheating and it took just 10 minutes while downloading did not cause it. So I assume mobile is going to its limit while performing fast, but if you do not maximize its performance and go easy on it, it will drain like normal phone and will give you at least 2 days on screen.

Undoubtedly, Sony's own music player and album gallery are some of the best ones out there. \n \r\nInitially before I bought the phone, I was a bit worried about the specs on paper.

I tell you at the beginning what u will hear again at the end> never buy a Sony phone. first of all, when u call one, every time u need to turn down the volume! because it gets reset to max volume rate automatically  each time your call is ended and phone goes back to lock screen.  it means that every time one calls you, you should stand a very loud shouting at your ears(max volume rate)!!! or you should remember each time you want to speak, to turn it down before! I think not even a third class second hand phone ever could have such stupid problem.  \r\n2- the battery life is not as explained or expected nowadays most people want to be on line during the day, and then you need to recharge it every night to let it go on. if you need to play or do your business through your phone, then you need to recharge it twice a day!  \r\n3- I guess the designer of  Experia Xa was first thinking of making a new heater, and on half way he decided to build a phone too. Or maybe Sony had already intention to make a phone with a dramatic heater,! then I suggest them to announce it immediately.  why?  turn on the camera, start shooting. wait for a short time even. feel the hotness on tour hands(not just warm, but really hot). or just update some of your apps. or use the phone, speak or do something for half an hour while screen is on(even at normal brightness), and feel the hotness.   \r\n4- in sound section, there are only 3 sound control instead of 4 voice level control bar that most phones  have. \r\n5- when  you pull down the curtain to see the icons, you can see that only for example 5 icons plus a brightness control bar, have occupied more that 50 percent of the screen. it is not as handy as it is in other phones. \r\n6-\" Great Sony voice\", dont believe it on Experia xa, it is a joke! the amplifier sound system does not respond to all video and app the same!  just go for example on  you-tube and try to watch a film. listen to the volume of sound, you can hardly hear it! but you may listen to a  music which is already exist in your phone normally. even though amplifier is weak and output sound is disturbing! Sony used to have a better quality in older model like in ION.  \r\n7- every time you are told \" update your system\". repeatedly. you can not clear this message.  \r\nyou want to see more...? the messaging app all the time announces \"it is not responding\", and more ..you may not transfer the installed apps into SD memo card as in e.g. Samsung you can,    \r\nand more.. the rounded grey folders that you make on your screen are too small and ugly... and you know what? keep away from this heater before it burns up all your money.", "date": "15 Sep 2016"}, {"text": "Z3 far more expensive than xa i would expect it to out perform xa however i find xa as good as if not better than z1 and inexpensive ", "date": "15 Sep 2016"}, {"text": "When z3 launched it was flagship device, xa is midrange device so don't compare both,  but xa has some latest features.

Xperia XA is probably the smallest (in size) 5 inch smartphone + one of the lightest: a big advantage for people who don't like bulky phones - easy to handle in 1 hand  \r\n2. Comparing 5\" XA to 5.5\" One Plus 2 & Moto G4 Plus doesn't make sense to me, unless you don't care about phone size..  \r\n3. XA Display looks pretty decent to me, even though its 720p. Compared to1020p on HTC One A9, I couldn't really see that much difference (I'm not that fuzzy). *Also, 1080p displays consumes more energy (battery would last even shorter...)  \r\n4. Design of XA is great too, but that's might be subjective... for me definitely one of the slickest mobiles on the market  \r\n5. Vibrations on Xperia XA are great, like on any other Xperia phone.  \r\n6. Camera takes great pictures in good light & very average in poor light conditions (good UI & manual options, though you need to spend some time to explore them to take even better pics).  \r\n7. Voice is perfectly clear during calls  \r\n8. Speaker volume is ok/Average, could have been a little louder, though you can adjust it in the EQUALIZER settings of Music player to get more out of it.  \r\n9. XA supports quick charge, but quick charger is not the default charger provided by Sony...  \r\n10. Positive surprise on the Anti Scratch Screen - Though XA still doesn't have Gorilla Glass, the screen is decent & no screen protector is required - tried scratching the display model in a store with my keys :D - no marks left  \r\n11. Front camera is 8MPix camera, but it's not very impressive...  \r\n11. BATTERY IS POOR, will only last 1 day with average use (though you have 2 energy saving modes - stamina & ultra stamina).

Well, I have bought it 4 days ago and so far, the user experience is quite good for me. \n \r\nOne thing that I like on this phone over many other phones from different brands would be the user interface. I certainly like the way Sony designed their interface, especially for media sections such as album galleries and music player. The display, despite being at 720p resolution, doesn't look bad even beside a 1080p unit. You can't really tell much of the differences with naked eye. Audio quality is surprisingly good if you know how to play around with the audio settings. \n \r\nThe only thing that I think this phone is no up to standard would be the battery life. For my own usage, I won't say that it drains a lot of power but I expected it to be better. The weird thing is, when I am using the phone, the percentage was not really dropping quickly. What is weird is that the percentage drops even when the phone is on standby, without any background running apps, WiFi off, GPS location off and mobile data off. The percentage just drops as time goes. Not a lot, but a noticeable amount. I wonder if this is a software bug that can be fixed on a future update. \n \r\nThe good thing that I can say about the battery is, charging is fast. In less than 30 minutes, I can get up to around 50% more power than before.

Perhaps it is not fair to compare an upper-shelve with a mid-range device but the difference in image quality was quite big.
