I use my devices heavily for WhatsApp and emails and streaming movies on YouTube, and movie streaming services. The MZP, on my estimate, can easily outlast the MZ2P by a couple of hours.\n2) Display calibration: I prefer the display on my MZP which has more natural colors when set to standard mode compared to MZ2P's standard color profile. The MZ2P's display has more \"pop\" even on standard mode. This is really dependant on one's preference though. \n3) Charging speed. I find the MZP can charge just about as fast as the MZ2P, and considering the MZP has the bigger battery, you can quickly top up and have more juice on the MZP.\n4) Less camera hump. With the same style shell, the camera hump on the MZP is flush with the body while the bigger hump on MZ2P means even with style shell on, the camera lens may not be as well protected because it is level with the shell.\n5) Well, it is quite a bit cheaper than the MZ2P...\nThings that are better on MZ2P:\n1) In hand feel. Due to its thinner profile and less sharp edges, the MZ2P is quite a lot nicer to hold compared to MZP, which has chunkier body and sharper edges. MZ2P looks more premium too because of this.\n2) One Button Nav. I have to get used to this, but after an initial period of adjustment, I find the one button navigation of the MZ2P to be quite intuitive and it also allows more screen real estate.\n3) Audio output through the headphone jack seems more powerful on the MZ2P. \n4) Bigger RAM and internal storage compared to MZP.\nOverall, both are fantastic devices but if you have to choose one device between the 2, I would advise picking up the MZP: it is cheaper, performance is smooth, battery life is quite a bit better in my experience(can opt out of buying the battery mod), although it is a chunkier device and the in hand feel is less premium than the MZ2P. \nNow I use the MZ2P as my daily driver, while the MZP is my \"media consumption\" device due to its longer battery life.", "time": "10-31-2017 05:22 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6047112", "text": "What about the camera differences?", "time": "10-31-2017 09:34 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6047880", "text": "They're both pretty decent but the MZ2P takes slightly better pictures to my eyes but both struggle in low light.

After reading the same reviews you probably did of Z2 Play and Force Edition, I concluded Z2 Play would be the optimal choice on both cost and battery life, despite its battery size reduction. I'm not afraid of smaller batteries *if* overall power draw is better managed, esp. screen draw. (The 720p 2013 Droid Maxx was a brilliantly balanced design in this respect.)\nHopefully lack of battery discussions is a sign of high satisfaction with battery life on this new model. Since the very launch of the 2015 Droid Turbo 2 I have, there've been seemingly constant threads due to many owners not seeing anywhere near the Verizon and Moto touted numbers, e.g. <2 hrs screen time, while others loving life at 5+ hrs screen time. Nougat update seemed to drive many of us down even further. I've come to suspect the DT2 suffered a batch of bad original batteries, and/or a power draining bug in the radio software stack. \nFWIW, I wound up having a $70 OEM battery replacement installed on my DT2, and now getting 14+ hour standby and 3 hour screen times far beyond any I had even when it was new, as measured by GSam Battery Monitor Pro. I'm a pretty heavy user, frequent Bluetooth, high power location services, Moto Voice enabled, etc.\nI'm hopeful to hear that your two year newer Z2 Play sees even better numbers than those.

I can easily get through a normal day (normal for me). In fact my average per-hour drain is around 2% (2.5% if I really push it). I'm not playing games on it but using it for browsing, phone calls, email, calendar. So no complained about a running averaging 35-40 hours.\nBut, the biggest battery drain by far is \n-Cell Standby 19% according to Android OS \n-Phone Radio 44% according to GSAM\nThe phone radio awake time is 100% which I suppose makes sense. I would not want the phone actually disconnecting from cellular. But that still seems high. My last monitoring session had over 5 hours of screen on time and still screen power use was half of the phone radio power use.\nCellular signal is poor where I live and work but am connecting to strong wifi almost all of the time in both places.\nOn one hand I am super happy with overall battery life.

However, since it sounds like you've identified your main issue (i.e., poor signal), you may want to force the phone onto its non-LTE radios and use those. A great app to do this is called \"Radio Switcher\" in the Play Store. \n*Generally speaking*, the 4G/HSPA signal is stronger in most locations than LTE is. Using the non-LTE radios also has the added benefit of saving you some juice, as the LTE radios drain your battery a bit faster. Doing this MIGHT alleviate your drain issues. Downside: data speeds are a bit slower, though I use 4G regularly to stream audio and video with no issues.\nGlad to hear the phone is treating you well overall.

I am coming from iPhone 7 realized I needed a larger screen more than I needed the pocketable size of the iPhone 7. iPhone 7 Plus seemed like a natural choice but iPhone 7 Plus is crazy expensive and with new iPhones just around the corner it seemed silly to drop $1000 in a 7 Plus right now. Great time to check out Android!\nI actually tried a Samsung S7 first. With some of the crazy discounts being offered, the S7 is half the price of the iPhone 7 Plus and a great deal. The S7 unlocked phone shipped with marshmallow but immediately updated itself to nougat after I set it up. \nI was disappointed in the S7. Battery life was less than I expected and I noticed lag straight out of the box. It had so many killer features on paper but the overall experience (for me) just didn't feel great. I thought \"if it is this laggy and the battery is already not awesome, it will only get worse in the future.\" \nI ended up returning the Galaxy after 3 days. \nThe Moto Z2 play seemed intriguing. Midrange specs in just about every way kind of put me off, but the price was right and the mods seemed kind of interesting. The idea of a cleaner Android was pretty appealing.\nAfter a week, here is what I think of the Z2 Play:\nSpeed - fantastic! Not laggy at all and very smooth. Even when running multiple apps the Moto just feels fluid and graceful. I cannot understand how the Moto Z2 processor is half the speed (single core) of the S7 and yet feels as fast or faster. But it does. I have watched plenty of speed test comparisons on YouTube and the S7 seems to only beat the Moto in loading time tests of big games. I don't play games like that much and don't care if they load 3 seconds slower. Overall, for day-to-day operations the Z2 flies!\nScreen - great! To me the Moto Z2 screen looks really good. Maybe a tiny bit less sharp than the Samsung but still very good. Colors look natural and contrasty. The only negative I've noticed is that the Moto in direct sunlight isn't the brightest and at night the minimum brightness is still too bright. Being Android, I was able to easily download a little utility that reduces minimum brightness. Problem solved!\nBattery life - outstanding! Easily gets me through a heavy day with room to spare and charges incredibly fast. No weird battery drains or runaway processes. I read that battery life was reduced compared to the Z Play, which may be true. But who cares with life this good?\nMoto software - Genuinely helpful. I love the \"open doorknob for camera\" and \"tomahawk chop for flashlight\" gesture controls. I love the \"show me\" voice commands. I like the swipe controls on the fingerprint scanner. I like the lock screen functionality. I love that the Moto just knows when I'm driving and switches to a completely voice-based system for texts. Why doesn't every phone have that driving mode?? Brilliant! \nBuild - very nice. The metal back and chamfered edges look high quality. Even the large camera bump out is nicely made. The Z2 Play feels solid and looks like a high quality phone.\nCamera - better than I expected, but not amazing. The camera takes very good photos in bright light. Well saturated, well exposed, and sharp. There may be a bit too much software sharpening, but most pictures look good. Low light photos are another story. The lack of OIS means the photos are grainy (due to high ISO being necessary) and still blurry (unavoidable camera shake). I wouldn't say the low light shots are terrible. In fact, they are useable. But low light pictures are definitely below the S7 and even the iPhone 6s. \nMods - more interesting than I expected. I have the wireless charging+battery extender, the JBL speakers, and a Style Shell. I've used the JBL as much as a high-quality speakerphone as anything else, and it works great!. Sure, I could buy a standalone bluetooth speaker but the sheer convenience and ease of use of the JBL is hard to beat. Likewise, the battery mod stays in my travel bag and I can either leave it attached during long travel days or slap it on for a quick charge and then take it off again. Either way, I appreciate that it doesn't make my already tall phone taller as most other phone battery packs do. The Style Shell looks really nice and actually makes the phone easier to hold. In general, I like the idea of the mods more than I expected. They are expensive though, and I wish there were more of them. Maybe beyond batteries and case backs there just aren't that many legitimate uses for mods. (the projector mod is cool, but I'm not sure how often it would get used) Still, Moto executed mods well and they do add value to the phone. \nWhat don't I like? Not much. \nWaterproof - nano coating is nice, but not the same as the flagships IP67 or IP68 ratings. With S7s and soon to be iPhone 7s dipping much closer to the Moto Z2's price, a nano coating just isn't enough.\nCamera - adding OIS would have made a huge difference to camera quality and I would happily pay a bit more for it. \nSize -the Leno Chin and Frankenstein Forehead are necessary to retain compatibility with Moto mods, but definitely they make the Z2 Play a physically large phone which is somewhat dated looking. \nOverall for me the Z2 feels like more than the sum of its parts and is a very enjoyable phone. On paper, it should fall to even last years flagships which are now similarly priced, but I think the Moto holds its own in terms of overall experience vs. those devices.", "time": "08-05-2017 01:27 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5913451", "text": "Thanks for your review!

I took a few shots this morning and compared them with an iPhone 7 (not the Plus). \nMy impressions are that the Moto camera software applies a lot more sharpening than the iPhone (and more than other camera phones I have seen). I really noticed it as sharpening halos around the leaves of the palm trees. . That could also be purple-fringing reduction algorithms as dark tree leaves against a bright background are notoriously tough for creating purple fringing on digital cameras. I see no evidence of fringing so some software corrections are happening. \nOverall, the Moto Z2 photos are sharp (right on the verge of being crunchy) and look pretty good. Exposure is slightly under, probably somewhere on the -1/3 side which I prefer to the iPhone actually. I didn't like the darkening of the Moto sky, making it look almost grey at the top. In fairness to Moto, I've noticed the iPhone 7 doing that a lot too but in this case the iPhone 7 sky looks much better. \nFor the indoor shot, I prefer the Moto picture hands down. Colors seem more saturated, the sharpening really helps with the overall scene here, and I think the contrast is higher (more pleasing to my eye). The iPhone photo looks slightly washed out in comparison. And yes, I realize the two compositions are not identical but hey, this is a quick snappy comparison :-)\nConsidering the list price of the 2 phones is $250 apart I think the Moto is holding its own pretty well. \nThe flower photo is also interesting. I tried much harder to frame exactly the same perspective on both phones. The Moto must have a slightly wider lens because I had to get a bit closer to the flower on the Moto than I did on the iPhone to make the picture nearly identical. The Moto depth of field is shallower in general and when combined with being slightly closer it renders the flowers less in overall focus than the iPhone. The background is more blurred to on the Moto, so overall the Moto has a shallower depth of field. \nHard to say which of these I prefer. I like the colors on the Moto a little better than the iPhone, but I think the iPhone is pulling in a bit more detail (even allowing for the deeper depth of field). the center of the sunflower in the iPhone shot seems just a bit more detailed.", "time": "07-30-2017 01:11 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5906034", "text": "I took a few more outdoor shots.

Very hard to meter and the Moto did well! A few blown out highlights (the white shirts of people) but overall metering is about what I would have done manually. Sky isn't blown out even though it is a bit lighter than actual, nor are the darker areas just a muddy dark mess.

Usually go for the flagship models, whether it's an iPhone, the Z Force Droid, the S8+, etc. So my experience is probably colored by those phones. \nHave been using the Verizon model, 32 GB, 3 GB RAM with a 128 GB Samsung EVO Select U3 micro SD card inserted. I'll be returning the Z2 Play for a couple reasons, the main ones being the lag, the camera and the much slower download speeds.\n-- I hadn't realized that chip architecture can limit download/upload speeds until reading about it in-depth, after noticing how much slower my downloads were, as compared to my other phones. My FiOS gigabit connection gets me at, or near, 500 MBs download on my other phones, while capping out around 110 with the Z2 Play. \n-- The lag is there, especially on apps such as Facebook and Google Photos. Editing a picture on Google Photos leads to a \"wait\" splash screen that forces me to close the app and re-open. (I've recreated that annoyance about five times.) \n-- The camera just isn't that good. Oh, bright light and outdoors it'll snap a nice picture, but inside, or in lower light, the lack of OIS reveals itself. \n-- On the plus side, it's a great looking and feeling phone. I use a Moto Modo black leather back and the Z2 Play feels great in the hand with it. I will say the battery was a pleasure, but with only using it for a few days, I can't say it's a battery beast. Not enough time for that. Also, even at Full HD, the screen seemed plenty bright enough in the sunlight. And there is still nothing to compare with Moto Actions. Flipping the wrist to activate the camera makes me smile every time, especially when watching somebody stumble to get the camera up on their iPhone. (Why the hell hasn't the great, almighty Apple implemented quicker camera access?)\nSo guess it'll be the new Z Force, whenever that drops, as I am a big fan of the Moto Z line and Moto Mods.
