I'm thinking of the projector and JBL, specifically. Their battery percentages show in the tray, but you certainly wouldn't want their capacities averaged out with that of the phone itself.\nI like the way Moto is handling the duplicate batteries, with the percentage in the tray.\nIt might be better to have two icons in the notification bar, but I dunno if I could sacrifice much more space up there, given that I've turned on seconds in addition to minutes and hours for the time in the top right corner.", "time": "03-26-2018 02:09 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6207564", "text": "I think the idea is to have it configurable so that you can display the second icon if you want or keep it hidden if you don't.

The mod battery % would still be available in the pull down as it currently is.\nAs far as the capacity I'll use simple numbers. Say the phone is 3000mah, and the battery mod is 2500mah, so total would be 5500mah and the percentage figured from that. Put a \"non-battery\" mod on, and it'll report capacity as 3000mah and adjust the percentage accordingly to %/3000mah instead of the previous %/5500mah. \nMeanwhile the \"mod\" battery percentage will always report the % of the mod on it's own. So it'll show %/2500mah left, while phone reports %/5500mah.\nPlace a non-battery mod, and it'll report that mod as %/1000mah and phone will report only %/3000mah.", "time": "03-30-2018 02:24 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6210532", "text": "Would be less accurate as well since it wouldn't account for the loss when using on battery to charge another.", "time": "04-01-2018 05:41 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6213333", "text": "I'd be on board with that", "time": "04-04-2018 11:36 AM", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post6188599", "text": "I would also like a way to have the battery % be from BOTH batteries.

I had done a system update when I first got the phone. In the past I've never had to do more than one system update when I get a new phone and it would just take it to the latest version. I came to find out I had to do 9 system updates to get it to stop having available updates. I've now had the power pack below 50% and back up to 100% twice and not a single disconnect. I've also carried it and tossed it around for 2 days and not a single disconnect. While I've never found out if there's a way to turn off the sound, I've kept my ringer volume up so I'd hear it just in case, but I never have. I'm going to say my problem is gone then, silly me just didn't understand Motorola and updates I guess. As far as the sound, I guess if it never disconnects again I'll never care .\nHi. I just got a Moto Z2 Force and I got the Moto Power Pack to go with it because I like to toss my phone down on my desk, counter, etc and was worried about the camera. I also have big clumsy fingers and without the extra height the mod provides I had a really hard time picking it up off said desk, counter, etc .\nAnyways, I installed the battery, set it to efficient mode and sat my phone down to charge both. It was fine until it got to about 62%, then the battery mod started disconnecting and reconnecting from the phone, each time making that really loud sound. It'd always reconnect, but it is annoying and happening every few seconds. Sometimes it'll go for 5 minutes, but then bam it comes back.\nI have 2 questions: \n1. Has anyone ever experienced this? I'll be trying it on my wife's Moto Z2 Force to see if hers does the same thing, trying to figure out if it's my phone or the battery pack.\n2. Is there a way to stop that terribly loud sound when you connect/disconnect a mod while keeping all other phone sounds normal? I can't believe there isn't a way to disable connection/disconnection sound, I'm hoping I'm just missing it.\nThanks!", "time": "02-05-2018 04:27 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Moto Mod App Update, control when a Power Pack Mod Charges", "thread": [{"postID": "post6151796", "text": "New in the Moto Mods settings to toggle if a Power Pack Mod charges the phone when connected.", "time": "02-01-2018 03:10 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6151833", "text": "I just saw the app update also.

Then I saw some reviews where they were underwhelmed with it and I wasn't sure. But I had trouble getting a decent shot of my kids playing sports (indoor, hockey (so it was fast)) with the stock camera. Tried other apps to get a 'sport' mode, but couldn't get a clear pic without blur. So since I like gadgets, and now had a real reason to try it, I bought it.\nRandom thoughts: Couple things I didn't know from the reviews I saw were that it had a couple different scenes, including a sport mode. That worked great for taking action shots. There is a delay taking the pic due to the focus, but when you start anticipating that, it works good. The flash fully lights a completely dark room. At full zoom, the physical camera button is hard to press without a shake, but you can use the screen's shutter button, and it works great. The'chin' at the bottom of the phone that people complain about makes this easy and comfortable to hold. It feels well made, and is fun to use. The optical zoom makes a huge difference in getting close to the action when you cannot move closer yourself, like a sports event. \nI was on the fence, but after having it 1 day, I think I totally made the right decision.

Live broadcast did not come as advertised, and then when something came out to be able to do live broadcast it is so unstable and terrible you wouldnt ever want to try again. \nThe live broadcast was one of the big things for me, I am a Fire Dept. PIO and wow what a deal would that be to do live broadcast so that you can show off your training. Well think again. The app crashes your phone about 4 times before you can get it to sta stable enough to use it. You use it and if you are lucky to get connected to Facebook it is so gittery no one can watch it. Before anyone says it's your internet, its not... I have done it on high-speed wifi, as well as full signal good strength cell service too. You go to save that live stream, and no audio gets saved... Just the jittery video. \nNow for some reason the camera app also crashes the entire camera when taking pictures. \nAnd yes, I have cleared cache, yes I have done a full wipe and redo the entire phone ... took me a week. \nI am now to the point telling family do not buy Motorola.

This greatly reduces the digital noise and can produce some really good shots. I also found that changing the exposure to +1 worked quite well.\nHad the mod been released with the performance of the .81 version of software I think it would have gotten better reviews even at the high price.\nColor is good, focus speed is reasonable for a cheap camera and sharpness is pretty good as well considering at $124 this mod is less then 5% of the cost of some of my tack sharp lenses....I cant expect it to be as good. I do love the familiar half press focus\nThe camera is a bit difficult to hold steady at maximum zoom and it would be nice if someone made a wrist strap for it.\nToo cold and windy to go outside so here's an indoor shot of my parrot, Nike.\nFirst, here are the photo parameters. This was taken in the auto mode creating both a RAW(.dng) and JPG.

The nylon version is slippery.CONTEXT\nRecently, I popped into Best Buy to pick up my first ever Moto Mod: The Moto Style Shell with Wireless Charging, in \u201cGrey Herringbone Nylon\u201d. Currently available in either Grey Herringbone Nylon or Floral Print with some press hinting at the availability of wood options in the future. I elected to buy this grey one in person. I decided the more subtle grey option was more my style than the colorful flowers available online. \nI was actually mildly surprised that the cover was nylon fabric instead of the grey plastic I anticipated, but that was more on me neglecting to read up on the specifics before hopping in.\nJust so you know what I\u2019m equipped with, I own a Moto Z Play with the charcoal ash wooden style shell, pictured above for reference.THE BOX\nThe Mod\u2019s packaging is very straightforward. It\u2019s a simple box containing the shell itself and two pamphlets to cover the usual legal, instructions, etc.THE COVER\nThe cover itself isn\u2019t anything unexpected. It\u2019s slightly thicker than my current wooden Style Shell at 3.25 mm and includes several pogo pins to enable charging. Why it needs more than two or three pins though for wireless charging is beyond me.\nThis new shell includes magnets on both the top and bottom of the cover, making for a more secure fit than my wooden back which only includes a magnet near the bottom. A particularly hot day in the car once made this wooden cover bend backwards slightly, compromising the fit. The extra magnet here is much appreciated.\nThe nylon feels like a textured velvet or a woven fabric and isn't really my cup of tea, although it certainly looks good. USAGE\nSnapping on the back greeted me with a distinctive chime and a quick tutorial on using this Mod, just in case I had neglected to read the quick-start guide like I\u2019m sure many others will do.\nIn the hand, the additional thickness and curvature isn\u2019t particularly noticeable, but what is much more noticeable to me is that the nylon back made for a textured but more slippery surface. \nThis may not sound like much, but with less friction I found myself adjusting to it in ways that were ultimately less than comfortable. It might be a nitpick as I didn\u2019t notice it entirely, but my pinky didn\u2019t appreciate its increased usage as a shelf nor did I appreciate a gravitational close call when the phone didn't quite stick to my fingers like I had anticipated. I\u2019ve switched back to my smoother-yet-grippier wooden back for now while I plan to switch this one out for it's floral print sibling.CHARGING\nAnd as for charging? It works.\nPlacing the phone on a charging pad makes the phone indicate that a wireless charger was detected and displays current battery percentage for a few moments before going to the lockscreen.\nThe OS says \u201ccharging slowly\u201d on my 10W somewhat generic Qi charger. Needless to say, you don\u2019t use wireless charging when you\u2019re looking for a speedy, efficient charge anyway. The Z\u2019s support \"TurboPower\" for if you\u2019re in a rush.\nUltimately, being the fan that I am for wireless charging, I was very excited for this shell but the material isn't exactly lighting my fire. The functionality works perfectly though, and if I like the feel of the floral back, that one might just become a permanent fixture on the back of my Moto. In the meantime, this nylon back isn't for me.The attached Mod next to a first-generation style shell.", "time": "08-06-2017 02:15 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5914421", "text": "Additional PhotosThis is only displayed for a few moments when charging begins.Charcoal Ash Style Shell on the left, Grey Herringbone Nylon Wireless Charging Style Shell on the right", "time": "08-06-2017 02:30 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5923640", "text": "Nice review/work up", "time": "08-14-2017 06:05 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5925230", "text": "Great review.

Really overall the Force is still relatively thin or in line with other larger screen phones. What I like most is that either battery when attached looks like the phone came that way. I see so much potential for these mods. I'm hoping a company will revamp the current battery mod and make a slimmer version even if it doesn't have quite the same output as the current batteries have.

Check out the campaign here:https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/e...s/x/15307718#/UPDATE 2\nThe Edge shield bumpers are available for pre-order at the Indiegogo campaign link!\nHi!\nMy team and I are working on a edge notification mod concept which I'd like to share with you (we're taking part in the transform the smartphone challange). Here's a quick look:\nWe missed led notifications and came up with an all-around edge light system - we're almost finished with the prototype. Small leds, which can be found on some phones are very underwhelming- we are planning to spice things up a bit.\nThe prototype has 20 individually lit leds, which can glow in basically any color. This allows for pretty much unlimited customization - patterns & colors.\nWe're linking this to 3rd party notificactions (facebook, twitter, instagram, gmail etc), text messages, calls, calendar events, emails and so on. You'll be able to set any color to any notification you like. \nThere's also additional functionality like:\n- a low battery status\n- gradual illumination and color shift as the battery recharges\n- option to save settings for different time/days\n- automatic on/off at specific time/day\n- option to link to specific contacts (calls and text messages)\nIt's a quick way of reading between the lines and knowing what kind of information your phone is reaching out to you with before you even unlock the screen. It also lets you priotitize - for example, you can enable it for the notifications you want to receive at a specific moment and not worry or get disturbed by the stuff you don't care about.\nYou can link specific notifications, like social media with color 1, work contacts with color 2, family & friends color 3 etc. Simple, quick and efficient. \nThere's no impact on battery life, as we're planning to squeeze in a 2000mah battery in there. It's going to be enough to power the enhanced notification for a few days or you can also use it to add some power to your phone if you have to. \nYou'll be able to set a specific battery % to start and stop charging at or straight after snapping it in - it will recharge the phone automatically.\nHere's a quick look at the app:\nWe're still looking into additional functionality and ideas, so all your suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\nWe will be running pre-orders through Indiegogo soon, you can sign up here:https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/c...ns/coming_soon\nHere's our website, you can find out more there: Edge \u2013 Supercharge your smartphone\nThanks,\nTom", "time": "01-16-2017 04:37 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5646326", "text": "Nifty idea. \nIs there enough room for this to work with a bumper case?", "time": "01-17-2017 02:11 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5646551", "text": "That would be my biggest concern as well.

This allows us to get lots of useful feedback and get closer to meet everyone's expectations.\nThe bad news (for some of you) is that we will not create a Mod that features an additional battery together with wireless charging. There are several reasons for this - Incipio already has a battery Mod with wireless charging, it would have impact on thickness (would probably go up to 6.5mm-7mm) and the edge notifications are a priority for our design.\nThe good news is that we decided to create 2 versions of our Mod:\nThe version that you have already seen and know - edge notifications with a built in 2000mAh battery, aiming for around 5mm thickness.\nWireless charging + edge notifications Mod, no battery built in. Aiming for 3.5mm thickness.\nThis is possible because we will be able to create electronics for both versions with the same dimensions. We will only have to replace some components and add a charging pad instead of the battery. A smart casing design will also allow for some savings on manufacturing.\nI hope you guys are as excited as we are with further progress and happy with the decision we made! \nThanks, Tom", "time": "01-26-2017 12:54 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5657650", "text": "Awesome!

Plus by strictly using the mod to power the device (or more correctly constantly keeping the main battery fully charged) you'll probably discharge the mod (an Li-ion battery) completely on a regular basis. [Taken from the web] \"One of the worst things you can do to a Li-ion battery is to run it out completely all the time. Full discharges put a lot of strain on the battery, and it's much better practice to do shallow discharges to no lower than 20 percent\". \nSo by using the main battery for 20% at the start, and then letting the mod do the rest you'll probably not deplete it too often which is better for the mod. The good news is that the mod is replaceable, but no sense helping it along to a quicker death .
