While bigger fixed lens cameras can have quite a lots of zoom range and versatility... \r\nThough at the expense of pocketability.\n \r\nWhich is where system cameras compromise: \r\nWhile in fixed lens compacts you have even heavily ruggerized and waterproofed cameras (like Olympus Tough serie) in pocketable size, in system cameras you really don't have much of pocketability. \r\nEspecially in DSLRs, which with their flapping mirrors are still semi analog in design. Besides that mirror hampering full integration of video shooting... \r\nTo use analogy DSLRs are like smartphone with old rotary dial. \r\nOnly area where they have overall advantage over mirrorless is fast moving target tracking, thanks to phase detection AF. (which is now found only from some mirrorless bodies)\n \r\nThat mirror box causes it's own limits to lens design heavily increasing size of wide angle lenses. \r\nAnalog film era legacy sensor formats add their requirements to lenses. \r\nSo when you add more than one lens amount of stuff needing carrying starts to increase fast. \r\nAnd no matter how capable equipment is it doesn't take any photos (not even badly composed/framed/exposed/focused ones) if you don't bother to carry it much, because of bulk/weight! \r\nReason why traditional cameras have lost share in photography to cameras built into phones is convenience.\n \r\nWith even tiny digital sensors exceeding performance of 35mm film (smallest analog format good enough for most uses) there's very little need for those legacy formats for general consumer use. \r\n\"Four Thirds\" format of Olympus (+Panasonic) designed without film era legacy baggage of Canon/Nikon strikes very good balance for that: \r\nWhile technically not as good in everything as bigger formats skilled photographer using proper lenses can produce fully same level quality than typical Canikon DSLRs in not so many years ago. \r\nMore importantly it allows very good scaling in lenses, depending if user wants smaller and lighter system or more quality/performance and ergonomy. \r\nIn some lens types you can get that high optical quality in really small size and light weight compared to film era legacy systems. \r\nAnd it has way largest lens selection of mirrorless systems all the way to higher optical and construction quality lenses with two manufacturers invested in it.", "date": "26 Dec 2017"}, {"text": "How does the offer applicable ??
