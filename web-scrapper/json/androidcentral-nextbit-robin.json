I also just bought my wife a Nexbit Robin when they were on sale at Amazon recently. Which so far from what I have seen, it is a very nice device. It seems very smooth and I honestly love the unusual design and UI. The camera is definitely a step down from her old phone but it is still good enough for what she uses it for. Also for her the battery doesn't quite make it through the day, but she uses her phones pretty heavily. For example she used to have a Galaxy S6 with a 3500mah battery case that wouldn't make it through the day either. So it's hard to beat up the robin too much based on her usage. Especially considering the internal battery alone is lasting about as long or even a little longer than the Samsung + external battery did.\nHowever performance wise the Robin can't come close to matching the 6P. Yes the 6P is a little on the large side, but once you get used to it, it's not bad. Although honestly if there were one thing I could change about it, it would still be to make it smaller, because it is larger than I really like. However the benefits of the 6P are that it has a stellar camera, a very fast processor, decent battery life and it is going to get system updates much faster and for a longer time, than anything else out there. \nPersonally my opinion is that if the price is not a factor for any of these phones get the 6P, it's definitely worth the premium. However if you want to save a few dollars and don't mind a slightly slower but more quirky and interesting device the Robin is not a bad choice either. It is a very good midrange device just don't expect the performance of a flagship phone. \nHonestly I haven't used a One+ phone so I cannot personally recommend or detract from it, but if I had to guess it would probably slot somewhere in between the 6P and Robin in terms of features specs and price and might be a decent compromise between the two. \nAlso since you are looking don't forget to look at the Nexus 5X. Performance wise it basically has the same specs as the Robin, but with the same camera sensor and system updates as the 6P, and in a smaller package. Honestly we had originally planned on getting my wife a 5X, but when the Robin went on sale it was just such a great deal it was hard to pass it up, plus she just really liked the styling of the Robin.", "time": "08-25-2016 09:39 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5401541", "text": "I went with robin, picked up a brand new one from Mercari for $240.

My workaround for now is to set the volume at low (it's not really so low but eh). Call volume is pretty good on speaker and in general.\nI'm on T-Mobile, so the VoLTE and Band 12 was a super important thing for me to have or else I would have passed on this device (more so the latter thing and not the former though). My work kind of sucks for reception big time, so WiFi calling was important and I was nervous about this. At work, I have not lost reception once. \nThe Robin has been mostly pleasant, my only issues are the following two things:\n-Battery life. I have had to charge my Robin every day, and I don't really like that. Coming from the SE which I charge every other day, this is a huge adjustment. If there's something I can do about this, I would be open to hearing it, but I'll rather not flash another ROM.\n-MMS issue with WiFi connected. This seems to be a issue for not just me. I randomly get MMS (from my friends, coworkers, and sis, but my coworkers are the most likely, more so group texts over images though). The scary thing about this is that I wouldn't even know if I have a MMS until I toggle the WiFi off. Luckily, I have 10gb of data but this is annoying for sure.\nSo I'm on the fence about keeping this for my two annoyances mainly. Generally though, I enjoy the sound, the UI/launcher, camera, and of course, the look of the phone.", "time": "05-13-2016 07:16 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5178321", "text": "I'm glad you gave it a second chance!

You can download and install CM13 on the Nextbit Robin. It's a bit of a process, but if you want, here is what I had to do on my Windows 10 PC:\nFirst you'll want to ready your computer:\n1) Download and install the USB Drivers for the Nextbit Robin\n2) Download and install ADB and Fastboot\n3) Download TWRP Recovery\n4) Download the newest CM13 nightly ROM\n5) Rename the TWRP download to twrp.img and the CM13 download to cm.zip and make sure you know where they are\n6) Download your preferred gapps package (google apps) Pick ARM64 in the first column, 6.0 in the second, and decide which version in the third\nNow you need to ready your phone:\n1) Go to Settings>About Phone and find the build number. Tap on that a bunch (I think it's 7 times to be exact) until it congratulates you on being a developer\n2) Go to Settings>Developer options and toggle on/active Android debugging (or ADB)\n3) In Settings>Developer options there should also be a toggle to allow bootloader unlocking. Make sure that's on/active as well\nWe have both devices ready. At this point, connect your Nextbit to your computer. You should get prompted on your phone on whether or not you want to allow your computer to access your phone. I've found that it's best to check the box to always allow and allow the computer access to the phone. Now we can send commands to your Nextbit from the command line using ADB.\nNow, with your Nextbit connected to your computer, open the folder on your computer that has the file twrp.img. Hold control and right click in this window; this should allow you to open a command prompt in this folder. WARNING: THE NEXT STEPS WILL WIPE YOUR DEVICE - MAKE SURE IMPORTANT FILES ARE BACKED UP\nNow in the command prompt type: ADB reboot bootloader\nYou'll see your device reboot into the bootloader. It should be in fastboot mode by default\nOnce the device installs, in the same command prompt type: fastboot -i 0x2c3f oem unlock\nIt should give you a warning at this point that you're going to wipe everything and whatnot. If you want an unlocked bootloader, agree.\nIt will wipe everything and you'll have a Robin that feels brand new, but the bootloader will be unlocked.Congrats! You've unlocked your bootloader! Now we'll work on the custom recovery.\n1) Once your Robin has booted, we need to get back to the bootloader screen if we're not there. Press and hold the volume down and power button together. This should force the phone to shut down. Once it's shut down, release the power button while holding the volume down button and then press it again to turn the device on and into the bootloader. It should be in fastboot mode by default.\n2) Since we still have the command window open and since we opened it in the folder that had the twrp.img file in it, we can right away type the command: fastboot -i 0x2c3f flash recovery twrp.img\n3) Reboot the bootloader in whichever way feels best for you\n4) Navigate to recovery using the volume keys and use the power button to boot into the recovery *note: if you aren't at a screen that says something about TeamWin, you're in the wrong place. I had to repeat steps 1-3 to achieve this. Not sure why, but it fixed it for me.Congrats! You now have a custom recovery installed on your Robin. Now we'll install the Cyanogen rom.This is where we're most likely to wreck everything. Be careful.\nIn the Team Win Recovery it will first ask you for a decryption password. I couldn't, for the life of me, figure out what they were asking for. I canceled out of the whole thing. It should then ask if you are going to want to modify the system partition. You have to swipe the slider along the bottom to allow this. Note: the way I'm going to install the rom is pretty risky since we don't have the option to backup before we wipe and install. Nextbit has made a tool that probably does a lot of the work that we've done automatically. It's a huge file, so I opted to not download it, but it should recover your phone should we get into trouble. \nNow that we have that out of the way, let's get installing.\n1) Tap Mount and make sure System, Data, and Cache are selected.\n2) Return to the TWRP home screen\n3) Tap Wipe\n4) Tap Advanced Wipe\n5) Select Dalvic, System, Data, and Cache\n6) Swipe to Wipe at the bottom\n7) Return homeAt this point, we've gotten rid of our Nextbit rom and the encryption so we can see the storage and install new things\n8) Tap mount again\n9) In the bottom right tap to Enable MTP\n10) On your computer now, you should be able to see your Robin under My Computer. Open up internal storage.\n11) Copy both cm.zip and your gapps package into internal storage\n12) On your phone, return home\n13) Tap Install\n14) Click the top option \"Up a Level\" until it disappears\n15) Find the folder that is named \"sdcard\" and go into it. This is where your rom and google apps are\n16) Select cm.zip and swipe to confirm flash\n17) Wipe cacheAt this point, you have CM13 installed! Now we need the google apps so you have the full Android experience\n18) Install gapps the same way you installed the cm.zip\n19) Wipe cache\n20) Go home, tap the reboot button, and reboot systemCongrats!!! You've done it!! You've installed Cyanogen mod on your Nextbit Robin! Set it up and let it rip! This process should be the same for any rom you can download.\nHope that was clear.

Although this doesn't work for all lighting scenarios so my feeling is this is just a software issue. I am pretty sure Nextbit is working on it from what I've read on their forums. Otherwise the camera typically takes a good photo. \nFor me it's somewhat of an issue, I tried to take photos of my always on the move 2yr old and by the time the shutter went off, he was completely out of frame.

They have a Robin working with Marshmallow running well enough for Scott Croyle to use as his daily driver. Things are still on schedule for a January deliver for early backers, so that's good. They've had another meet up in London recently where they showed off the final colors (including the backer exclusive Electric colorway), and showed off the working Robin. Up until recently they were showing the OS on a Nexus 5. In the next few weeks I believe the camera samples should be shown off. Those who have heard the audio on a non-final build say it's as loud and clear as the HTC One M8 which is impressive imo. \nNot sure how much you've been following Nextbit, so all that could be old news for you. I'll try and help with any more questions if you have them. Just ask \nOh, one important thing: They've changed the material for the middle back piece.

In the last month I tried 3 different phones: Moto X Pure, OnePlus X, and just recently, the Nexus 5x. I found fault with each of them, eventually favoring my OnePlus One running SlimSaber every time.\nI am looking for a smaller screen size/form factor plus great ROM support. I was really hoping the 5x was going to do it for me, but I found it very laggy and would often become completely frozen. there have been a lot of reports about this, but I attribute it to the 2GB of RAM.\nThe Robin seems to have the same specs as the 5x, with the bonus of 3GB of RAM. Time will tell if the developer support is there. If it is, I'm going to try it. At $399 retail, I bet it will be available on swappa for a little less than that, which would make it a pretty good deal in my book. I'm a little concerned about the bottom notification LED, as there is no way to cover it up when it's on your bedside table. But there are ways to disable the LED with Do Not Disturb I believe, so maybe it will be a non-issue. I like the design/aesthetics, too.
