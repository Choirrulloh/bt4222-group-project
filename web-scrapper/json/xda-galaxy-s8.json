How about turning off Sync and manually syncing only when you need to.  I get the word \"smart\" is placed in front of the word \"phone\" but the real use of the device is as a PHONE.  For any other use, even Samsung sells that \"dock\" thing where you *can* use the phone as an android desktop-like replacement, but even there, its plugged in while in that use!\n\nBecause I'm not constantly checking emails and not using those communications apps that many of your type of person seems to use, I don't need Sync turned on, and would rather have the option to do manual sync on EVERY app, where some fail this (or have in the past) requiring lots of extra steps too get them to sync when you want to ...\n\nIts that constant SYNC of data that you aren't using *right now* that is always draining your battery.  Otherwise I'm sure you're not complaining that you use all these apps all the time, and by nature of the fact that using memory and processing capabilities actually USE power from the only source it has (the battery) .. right?\n\nIts not the same argument as the recent Iphone garbage where Apple was caught deliberately slowing down the processing to conserve battery draws to maximize the length of time the \"smart\" in the smartphone could actually run.. nor is the battery life an issue with regards to the explosive fire causing nature of the previous note gen phone right?\n\nOr do you actually think you should be able to play racing games on your phone for hours at a time, without consequence? or have constant wireless or cellular data in use downloading or just even CHECKING for updates regardless if there are any .. \n\nI don't begrudge your type of user from wanting more battery life, but you have to accept the responsibility for your actions too .. if you wanted longer battery life, you'd need to chose options more accordingly.  This phone has no \"user replaceable\" battery, and in days of old, companies would make extra capacity batteries and would include a new back cover for your phone to allow for the bigger battery bulge.. \n\nI don't like the saying  .. but its true in this case .. It is what it is.  The battery will only last as long as the power draining apps you run can be sustained.\n\nPS/Edit: by the way on my S8 I'm getting nearly 2 days of use, I play 4 games regularly, but none of them that require constant processing power, so the largest use of that power is the screen being on.  And with that, I manually lower the brightness so that it is less than what the \"auto\" setting would use.\n\nand an FYI ... anything that does \"location\" work ... thats a big energy hog too .. geo location with satellites is yet another battery drain.  Social heart-beat apps too how do you think they know where you are or you know where they are? ... close proximity broadcasting and data transmissions .. you either find out through Bluetooth or a combination of that plus Geo-Location sent back to their servers .. data data data and MORE data.. ... read that as battery zapping bits moving about when you don't need them ... wanna know if your friend is close by? how about looking up and away from your phone for a minute?", "time": "17th January 2018, 06:02 PM", "postID": "post75235342", "replies": []}]}, {"text": "Love it too, wish the snapdragon ver had root with magish", "time": "11th December 2017, 07:24 PM", "postID": "post74813489", "replies": []}, {"text": "Lots of love on this thread!!", "time": "5th January 2018, 09:46 AM", "postID": "post75085036", "replies": []}, {"text": "I know Im a bit late to the party,  (I always wait about 3 - 6 months before buying a flagship, so the bugs get sorted)  but I Just got my regular S8 (Ive used an S8+, but in UK... the + is STILL an extra \u00a310p/month on contract).. and yep...

So in that respect, extremely happy.\n\nThe phone itself is very good. The camera & video can be excellent especially in sunlight, night shots are good too.\nWith 64GB space I can take over 2000 pics and videos before I have to download and erase.\nSpeaking of space, one thing I have been waiting for, for years is the ability to hold all my mp3s on one device. The 256gb card does it for me. I think there's 40k odd songs on it right now. Of course during all this time of waiting, it's not really that important anymore with all the streaming services available. I have amazon prime/unlimited music so...\n\nSpeedwise I can't complain, I just pulled 50Mbps this afternoon on my local tower. The camera is mostly quick to respond though I miss the shake to wake camera app my last Moto had.\n\nBiggest non-love is the screen. Not a fan of the long and skinny aspect ratio. I think the S7 Edge with 5.5\" is the better form factor, but I had an S6 and didn't want an immediate upgrade, I usually skip a year. But really other than that I like everything about the S8.

I really only charge overnight when I have to, like if I was out all night and couldn't charge it. \n\r\nRegardless, Samsung should care more about battery life. There are phones with AOD that have far better standby battery life and SOT. My previous LG phone and my girlfriend's iPhone 6s have much better battery life.

On average you will get 300-500 charge cycles before degradation takes over, meaning that the less cycles you have put the battery through, the longer a longer life it will have. Also if want maximum life of you non removable battery, every 30 charge cycles, maybe once month, you should let the battery discharge to the point of turning off and then fully charge it as to keep it the battery and gauge in your phone calibrated (you don't have to discharge as that's a cycle but sometime needed). Either way, what were both talking about is a mute point, battery is replaceable if you really want to and that your phones battery should last 2 years with charging it overnight every day/every other day, I've always charged ALL my phones overnight and never had I needed to replace a battery nor did i loose capacity to the point of noticing (you might loose 10-20% rated capacity over the 2 years). I can easily get 7 hours of SOT on this phone and is the best out of all I had. Everyone has different results and heat is your batteries worst enemy, if this were 10 years ago then yes, batteries were like as you say and you would prolly pay more attention but not now.
