The screen is only 720p but thats alright. Quite interested to see how this does. Hopefully it sells really well. \nWhat worries me is the '100% Original' and the wink face hahaha. Why wouldnt it be 100% original lol", "time": "03-06-2017 06:58 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5707328", "text": "I think in that market... they get lots of BRANDED devices that aren't 100% original.", "time": "03-10-2017 08:32 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5707338", "text": "It looks so nice!
