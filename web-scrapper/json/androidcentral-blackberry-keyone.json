I was a BB10 hold out until the launch of the KEYone in June of last year, but I still dual carried my Passport until December of last year. For most the fluidity of BB10 meant that you could get serious work done without the need to worry about fancy customizations and themes. The ability to swipe right to get to the Hub and the clutter-free main screen allowing quick and easy access to the camera, phone, search bar and clock was, for me at least, a productivity dream. When I switched to Android, I missed the simplicity that BB10 offered. Blackberry launcher provided a lot with its implementation of programmable keyboard shortcuts but lacked any other connection to it\u2019s past. This separation of past and present seems, for the most part, bridged thanks to a new launcher being developed by Zinqs LLC. ZINQS Launcher for Blackberry 10 users has been my daily launcher since it\u2019s initial launch in late December and has only gotten better every single update. The developers have developed mostly Windows applications in the past but were eager to support the Blackberry when reached out to by a forum member.\nScreenshots are taken from my KEYone\nSome of the stand out features that this launcher bundles are keyboard shortcuts, the ability to swipe right to view the Hub (This is currently in beta, and Zinqs informed me that this feature is still being worked on), BB10 style quick settings, phone, search and camera shortcuts and lots more. The current forum thread about the launcher can be found here, and the launcher can be found from the Google Play Store here. The developers are active daily and are always looking for ways to improve the launcher to make it even closer to its BB10 roots. \nMy trusty Passport\nFor users coming from a launcher such as Microsoft Launcher or Nova launcher, you may be initially underwhelmed. The settings screen may feel lacking, and the inability to utilize double tap to sleep, or gestures to pull up applications may seem like a huge step backward. This launcher isn\u2019t built to compete with the feature-packed launchers, but rather to appeal to those who enjoyed the simplicity and appearance of BB10. \nWhen you first install the launcher, you will need to give it permissions to use widgets which is used to place the Hub widget within the launcher. For now, you can enable the secondary widget screen before the Hub, use Blackberry Device Search, and use either the BB10 10.1 or BB10.3 theme. You can change the app layout from 4x4 to 8x8 grid allowing for use on both phones and tablets. \nScreenshots are taken from my Priv\nZinqs LLC has managed to create a launcher for BB10 fans within four weeks, and it is better every day. For those who want to use a modern device but is the experience of BB10 then this launcher may be for you. It is still a work in progress, but it is by far the best option for those who wish to relive their Blackberry past. The ability to use Keyboard shortcuts, Swype to the Hub, and a BB10 skin makes this launcher one app that you should keep an eye on. It is available for free from the PlayStore. The first 24 hours allows the user to play around with the launcher, and after that, it is USD 4.99 or USD 3.49 a year. \nThe support thread can be found here. Just make sure you change your wallpaper from the stock one to one of your own.

Come here often to read up, but forgot what username and password I signed up with back when I had the GS3. \nAnyway, thought I'd share a few of my first experiences. I've had the Blackberry KEYone from Sprint for just over a week now and thought it was time to write about some of the features and things I like about it. I'm sure some of these things have already made the rounds and some of the things I like others may not. \nIt's still pretty early in the game and there's been a few maintenance releases and such, but overall I'm finding the Blackberry experience to be quite nice.Body - I really like the way the Blackbery KEYone (BBK1) feels. It's a nice solid device with a very cool executive look. It's not too thick even with the keyboard and the screen is a wonderful size for email and texting. I was afraid that the keyboard was going to take up too much real-estate when in fact it made it easier to type while still seeing what I was typing. Granted, in landscape mode for watching YouTube and such, the screen is smaller than many of the other devices on the market today. All I can say is watching videos on the BBK1 is a pleasant experience. The picture is crisp, clear and bright. I found it quite comfortable to hold it in landscape mode as I didn't have to place both hands solely around the edges to hold it for fear of blocking the screen.\nDid I mention how handsome this device is? I digress...The Keyboard - oh boy. So, as an old Blackberry user I was really torn up when I had to move to an android device that was all touch keyboard. I got used to it though and never looked back. Coming back to a Blackberry after all this time had me at a slight disadvantage. There's a learning curve to using a physical keyboard. It's only been a week, but I'm getting the hang of using it again. The buttons feel nice. They have a slight click when you push them, though they push easily and smoothly. Word prediction is particularly nice on this device and they built in really cool swiping gestures to choose the predicted words. For example 3 predictive word options pop up. One on the left, one in the middle and one on the right just above the keyboard. Just swipe up on the physical keyboard to the left, right or middle to choose the word. Cool! You can also swipe back to delete.SWEET FEATURE ALERT! You can set the Physical Keyboard to swipe! I Love this feature. One of the things that made it easier for me to come back to using a physical keyboard is this cool little gem. I have no idea how they added sensors to the keys like they did, but if you go into keyboard settings and activate the physical keyboard swipe options (search Keyboard under settings > Choose Blackberry Keyboard > Type by swiping). It's just super cool. Just running your finger over the key's your normally press types the words on the screen. As I've only figured this little trick out a little while ago I'll have to report back on it, but so far I like it a lot. It's a neat trick. Yeah - I said neat. W'ever.,\nThe keyboard also works like a track pad on multiple apps - when reading articles, scrolling through text messages, surfing or in the Blackberry Hub. Just swipe your finger up and down to scroll.Microphone - Look, lets be honest here. Blackberry is highly regarded in the business world. As such, the basics of a phone call are quite important. This phone is great for conference calls! People report being able to hear me loud and clear. I've used the microphone on the device itself with speaker on and off. Not one complaint from the listener on the other end. The noise canceling microphone does a nice job, though as with every device I've ever owned the cancelation is stretched to it's limits when used in NYC with all the sirens and constant background noise. General background noise like typing etc. is still picked up from time to time, though the speakers voice is the prominent sound to pass through. This holds true for the mic when speaker is turned on or off. Also, the headset is great for conference calls. I'm often using 'Skype' with a USB headset which sounds nice and clear. However, when I used the BBK1 to dial in to my conference sessions no one was the wiser. I asked how I sounded and everyone said 'loud and clear'. I haven't tried the headset/earbuds for music yet. They don't look like much, but hey - they could surprise me. From a phone call standpoint they sound great. People come through clear to my ears and not tinny. In a time when some manufacturers don't put any headphones in the box, this is a nice addition to have included.The finger print scanner is one of the best I've had experience using! Hands down.. seems to just work. \nIt's built into the space bar on the keyboard and hasn't failed me once. I haven't had to clean the sensor like on some of my other devices. It's pretty cool placement and though I initially had it set to read only my thumb, I've also added my pointer finger to make it easier to access while the device is lying down on it's back on the desk. TIP! When the device is asleep I've found I could just push the spacebar with my finger and it will read my print and unlock at the same time. This is a fantastic way to get the device unlocked and operational very quickly.Quick Charge 3.0 with the USB-C works really well on this device bringing it to 50% in around 30+ minutes. I find it depends on what's running in the background so they also included a feature called 'Boost Mode' which stops apps from running in the background to conserve energy and charge faster. This Boost Mode only works up to 50% and then switches to regular charging. You can change this setting to boost charge to 100%, but keep in mind Email, Messaging and other apps may not update unless you open them. The BBK1 comes with a 3.0 Quick Charger in the box.Battery Life - well, I have to say I'm not a HEAVY user by any stretch. Since most of my days are in front of a computer I don't go to the KEYone that often. That being said, I charged the phone fully the day I activated it and in a week I've only had to charge it again once. I'm at 28% as I write this and will put it on the charger soon.Blackberry Hub App - love it or hate it? Blackberry Hub comes native on the BBK1. Personally, I like that all my messages, calendar items, emails etc are all in one place. I have the option to pull in other messages from my social networks as well, though since I use this primarily as my work device I opted not to include all the clutter. \nStill, Hub is a great way to see everything at a glance. You can open up any of the items you bring into the Hub and get right to the app it's aligned with. If I click on an email from Hub it brings me to the email in the Email app. Nice touch. Missed calls and text message are right there and available. I like it.\nThere's more.. but I've got to spend more time with this device.\nSome things do take getting used to - Power Button on the left instead of the right and I've become reliant on an always-on display. Maybe in a software update? Smiley Happy \nRick\nAs part of a device ambassador program I have the glorious opportunity to test out multiple devices by multiple manufacturers and write my opinions.

Definitely 'treble' heavy with practically no audible bass. I suppose that could be construed as 'tinny' though I don't find it grating or irritating. Though the bottom of the phone appears to have 2 speakers, there's really only one. With the phone lying on its back the speaker is on the bottom right. To be completely honest, this wouldn't be my go-to for playing music. \nFrom a call perspective the speaker is just great. Voices come through clear. Also, found volume to be adequate for calls as well. Some devices don't have enough power to the speaker when on speakerphone. So far the KEYone has done a solid job in that dept. It's not 'extra' loud, but definitely loud enough and performs quite well. Though some devices are equipped with a 'louder' speaker (kyocera duraforce pro) when the BBK1 is at full volume it doesn't distort which I've experienced on others. \nUsing the BBK1 for Maps and Navigation is also loud enough, though as with any device I've used it strains to be heard when the windows are open in the car. I've found with the speaker placement on the bottom of the device I like it best with the phone mounted up on the windshield toward the driver's side of the vehicle and the speaker facing the driver side window (I'm in the US so that's with the phone to the left side of the windshield and speaker to the left).

There was a cool feature I used all the time where I could double tap my screen to see the time/date and other notifications. After switching from that device to other's I found myself constantly tapping on the screen only to find they didn't operate the same way. It was habit.\nWell, it's a nice habit and I'm glad to see that double tapping on the Blackberry KEYOne (BBK1) screen will bring it to life allowing me to look at the date/time and notifications.\nFor a short time I was disappointed that the BBK1 didn't have an always on display, but now that I can just lightly tap the screen I no longer have that concern.\nSo, double tap and the screen comes to life. Nice.https://1.bp.blogspot.com/95VqG5LGyk...86PnsClLQ=s800 \nWell, double tap also has another cool function. \nWhen in typing mode - as in an email or a text message, you can double tap the keyboard to get into a cursor mode. This allows you to swipe your finger left/right/up/down on the keyboard after double tapping to move the cursor similarly to how you would with a mouse. This is particularly good for getting perfect placement of the cursor to correct a typo or to add in additional text.\nI've found myself using this with almost every email I've sent since discovering this feature.https://4.bp.blogspot.com/Jx73kg6LoD...3BwjORP7g=s800\nThat's all for now - bite sized pieces . \nThere's more tomorrow though.

Also, I don't use many widgets on my screens. I prefer a simple clean looking device, plus I find they tend to drain battery quickly - though I definitely limit some of the functionality I could gain from using widgets.\n... and then I found PopUp Widgets and I'm able to get the best of both worlds. \nSo, check this out - any apps you have on your screen (not in the app drawer) that have 3 dots under them means it's PopUp Widget capable. Just swipe up on the icon and you'll have quick access to a widget without having to open the app! Check out the 'Android Central' PopUp widget for example and you'll see the top news articles immediately.

It looks sharp, the clear model that I have gives you a remarkable viewing experience for the fashionable exterior of the phone, it offers quality protection, but doesn\u2019t compromise on form factor, and all around it just feels good. \nRingke has been making cases for quite some time now, and the Fusion line of cases is popular with many other devices. I have personally been using the Ringke Slim cases for many of my devices for years, and that\u2019s one of the reasons I was so excited to get my hands on the new Crystal Clear Fusion case for my KeyOne. For those of you who are KeyOne owners, or prospective owners, you know there aren\u2019t a whole lot of quality cases or accessories floating around for the KeyOne \u2013 I know\u2026 I\u2019ve looked. As luck and fortune would have it, Ringke stepped up to the plate and hit a real homerun with this one, and really did the phone justice when designing this case.The Look: The old phrase, \u201cthere are many clear TPU cases, but this one is mine\u201d comes to mind, when thinking about the Crystal Clear Fusion case for the KeyOne. There are three color variations available: Clear, Smoke Black and Rose Gold Crystal, but the basic underlying principle still remains \u2013 it fits like a glove, and it really shows off the craftsmanship of the KeyOne. The only color differences you will see are in the bumpers themselves. Regardless of color, the back of the phone is the same crystal clear window. \nThere are two characteristics that I love in cell phone cases \u2013 one is minimalism (I don\u2019t like the case to be bulky or greatly modify the form factor), and the other is showing off the phone; needless to say, the Fusion case checks both of these boxes. If you\u2019re a stranger to the KeyOne, please go look at some images on the internet, because it\u2019s a gorgeous device. If you own one, you probably share many of the same sentiments that I do. You love the way the phone looks but you don\u2019t want to risk damaging it. So where\u2019s the compromise? Well, look no further because the answer is right here \u2013 it\u2019s the Ringke Fusion case. The case is called \u201cFusion\u201d for a reason. Based on my calculations, it\u2019s called the Fusion because it fuses with your phone, and provides protection, without detracting from the overall look and feel of the device. Secondly, the case really helps to bring out the device\u2019s sleek exterior, offering an unobstructed viewing experience and enhancing the overall presentation of the device. On a cautionary note, in my video, I mentioned that the case is not prone to smudges and fingerprints. While this is true, and it\u2019s the best that I\u2019ve encountered, after some use the prints and smudges will eventually build up, but can easily be wiped off with your shirt or any available cloth object.The Feel: As soon as you open the packaging, you\u2019ll be able to feel the quality craftsmanship of the Fusion case. It\u2019s rigid enough to let you know that it\u2019s going to take good care of your device, but at the same time, it\u2019s pliable enough to snugly hold onto your device, and not let go. An added design feature is a slight lip to the rim of the case, which adds a tiny buffer of protection for your screen and keyboard when you want to place the phone face-down. As I stated above, the case is made out of TPU, and it\u2019s a typical unibody, bumper style case. What does this mean? It means it\u2019s not the grippiest, and the back of the phone does not have any texturing for grip, but it would seem that this is by design. The lack of texturing is usually something that I wouldn\u2019t care for, but in the Fusion case, it just works. Why does it work? It works because it\u2019s like looking through a glass window so you can see the finely crafted rubberized backing of the KeyOne, in all of its glory \u2013 the silver BlackBerry logo, and subtle dimples in the surface really stand out underneath the crystal clear protection of the Fusion. Having said all of that, the surface of the phone case and the edges aren\u2019t particularly slippery, and it\u2019s an improvement over the stock feel of the device. And last but not least, the buttons. Like I said in my video, normally this isn\u2019t a \u201cselling\u201d point for me, which means I won\u2019t really be preaching about how great buttons are. Well, in the Fusion case, the buttons are phenomenal. The first time I ever pressed in the power button, it set off the \u201cwow\u201d lightbulb in my head. Not that it\u2019s a to die for feature, but in the world of TPU cases, I haven\u2019t found one yet that has such responsive, easily pressed key overlays. Job well done, Ringke!Protection: If you don\u2019t know already, consider this your warning: the KeyOne is not waterproof! Having said that, this case will not protect your phone from accidental, or purposeful dips into the pool, or any other body of water. Is that the case\u2019s fault? No. It\u2019s just not what the case is designed to do. What the case is designed to do is to provide protections from life\u2019s potential slips, drops and falls. The packaging states that it offers \u201cmilitary grade\u201d protection, and I\u2019m not sure what this means, other than the case is sturdy and should provide ample protection in case you accidentally knock it out of the night stand, or if it slips out of your pocket while you\u2019re sitting in a chair. It\u2019s definitely not rated for 10-15ft drops, or something I would entertain using if you\u2019re planning on doing parkour or BMX racing, but it does provide an excellent amount of protection for simple drops, especially with the reinforced bumper support around the edges. As you\u2019re probably used to by now, here\u2019s my Public Service Announcement: put a screen protector on the phone \u2013 which you can also find on Ringke\u2019s website! This isn\u2019t a plug for Ringke, but if you\u2019re ordering the case (even through amazon), throw one of these in your cart as well. Having a good case is great, but you\u2019re not going to be able to offer 360 degree security for your phone without a good screen protector as well; end PSA.Overall: The Crystal Clear Fusion case by Ringke is top-notch. It\u2019s incredibly affordable, it\u2019s sleek, fancy, and provides great protection for the device without compromising on the phones form-factor or aesthetics. After trying out several other cases for my KeyOne, I am happy to say that this one has won the special title of \u201cdaily driver\u201d status, meaning that it will be my go-to case for the foreseeable future. Is it for everyone? Maybe not. Some people prefer to go sans case, and some people want the extreme protections that have been traditionally offered by companies like OtterBox, or LifeProof But, does this case check enough boxes to make even the most protection oriented owners happy? I think so. The cardinal rule after all is that you don\u2019t drop your phone, but, life happens, which is why we buy cases! Fortunately we live in a world with many options, and so far, I definitely recommend you give Ringke\u2019s Fusion case a look!Pros:\n-\tIt looks and feels great, especially with the Crystal Clear window on the back of the phone!\n-\tIt\u2019s cost effective! It\u2019s not \u201ccheap\u201d, but it\u2019s well-priced, and impressive\n-\tIt protects the phone without compromising the look and feel of the device\n-\tThe buttons are snappy, and the craftsmanship of the case is top-notchCons:\n-\tIt\u2019s not waterproof, but it\u2019s also not designed to be. It\u2019s not a full enclosure case.\n-\tIt\u2019s not the cheapest, or the most expensive. But remember, you get what you pay for!\n-\tIt doesn\u2019t really have any texture to it, so it can still be a little slippery\n-\tWhile it is fingerprint and smudge resistant, it\u2019s not fingerprint and smudge proof. It will need to be wiped off every one in a while. \nIf you\u2019re interested in picking up one Ringke\u2019s new Crystal Clear Fusion cases for your KeyOne, head on over to https://www.ringkestore.com and check them out. You can also find them on Amazon, where they are currently on sale for $11.99, which goes great with Amazon Prime free 2-day shipping, if you have it.

I'm guessing the problem is that when the Hub tries to sync, it tries to upload new contact photos enriched by Gravatar to exchange, and silently fails, effectively causing sync to fail all the time after that. \nSolution is to disable Gravatar sync under Settings->Accounts->Gravatar, and then remove the Exchange account, and then add it again (so the contacts get initially synced again clean without the Gravatar enrichment).

It's opposite to many of the other devices I've had experience with ranging from Samsung to LG and Kyocera. \nNot sure if this is hardware or software or a combination of both, but an always on display would be useful.

The beautiful design with a gorgeous screen and incredible BlackBerry keyboard, combined with a near stock Android experience with a few usable additions, make it a truly compelling device. As such, you want a truly compelling and beautiful case to go with it right? Of course you do! Well SatchelSatchel heard you, and boy did they answer. The Good: Hard to go wrong with leather\nSatchelSatchel is a small company that specializes in making hand-made, high quality leather bags and accessories. They recently decided to bring their skill and experience into the world of phone cases and their efforts show here. Everything about this case exudes luxury and craftsmanship. It is beautifully stitched together and the leather is gorgeously tanned for a great look, feel, and yes, smell. Call me crazy but there\u2019s something about the way leather smells that\u2019s just awesome. The KEYone fits into the case quite well with a solid hold, but not being so tight that the phone is hard to get out. There is an extra pouch sewn into the front of the case to allow for business cards or possibly a credit card. The clasp that holds the whole thing closed is solid so you won\u2019t have to worry about your phone slipping out, but it\u2019s still plenty easy to open. \nIf the leather design is not cool enough for you, these guys are actually double agents! They are not just cases, but they are holsters too! That\u2019s right! You can relive the glory days of BlackBerry by throwing these on to your hip for even quicker access. And you\u2019ll probably want to, too. The KEYone is already a fairly large device and once inside the case, you won\u2019t want it to be spending much time in your pocket. The only way to really carry it comfortably is on your hip...like a hipster. Get it?? There are actually two options for hip-carrying. There\u2019s a belt loop that is sewn into the leather on the back, or you can opt for a belt clip that rotates allowing you to carry it vertically or horizontally (the belt loop only allows for horizontal transportation). \nIt comes in three amazing colors: Black, Brown, and Natural Tone, which starts out as more of a beige or skin-tone color, but it ages and colors beautifully with use and sunlight. The Bad: It\u2019s big...and not in a good way\nFor all the beauty of the design, there are a few things about this case that I\u2019m not a fan of. First, the small pouch on the front, while large enough to hold business cards, cash, or a lone credit card, is quite tight, making it fairly difficult to remove said items once inside. Now it may loosen up over time, but I\u2019ve only had the cases for a couple of weeks so I can\u2019t really speak to that. In my experience, it actually made it more inconvenient than using my pocket or wallet. \nSecond, I\u2019m just not a holster kind of guy. Now this is entirely personal preference, but I just don\u2019t like or use holster cases. Also, the colors I was sent would be even more difficult for me to wear because I just personally don\u2019t think they look that great on the hip. There is a black version of the case which would probably look much better but I didn\u2019t receive that one. Again, this is almost entirely personal preference, but I like to be honest. It would be hard for me to wear these on my hip every day. \nMy last issue with this case is the size. Let me qualify this by saying that I\u2019m more of a minimalist when it comes to cases, but this thing is not small, inconspicuous or subtle. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it looks great, but it\u2019s very noticeable. That may not bother you but for me it makes it almost unwieldy. Like I said before, the KEYone is not a small phone and when you put a large phone into a large holster, everything just gets bigger, and not necessarily in a good way. Once again, a lot of this is personal preference, but I\u2019m just trying to let you know what you\u2019re getting into. \nI admit that I may very well may be over-exaggerating a bit here, but these are just my impressions of the thing. You won\u2019t really know for yourself until you have one. They do have a 30 day return policy for undamaged, unused units so give it a shot!The Ugly: It\u2019s gonna cost ya\nI\u2019m just going to throw it out there, this thing is expensive. The belt loop model is a cool $118 (yeah that\u2019s what I said) and the belt clip version is 10 bucks more at $128 before taxes and shipping. Yes, you pay for shipping. That\u2019s hard to swallow, especially since BlackBerry\u2019s own leather case is $40 (some are even cheaper). Yes, it\u2019s hand made and it comes in three different colors, but $118 is a lot of money for ANY case. There was only one other manufacturer I found that even comes close to that price and they offer customization options and quite a few more colors too. \nLet me say it again though, this case is gorgeous. What you are paying for is an extremely high quality design and build that is so good, you most likely will never need to use the lifetime warranty. This thing isn\u2019t made in a factory and you won\u2019t be able to find another or better hand-crafted leather case/holster combo out there. If you really want to complete the look of luxury with your KEYone then this is absolutely the case to get. It\u2019s big, it\u2019s expensive, and it makes quite a statement. If that\u2019s your thing, then head on over to their website and pick one up. I recommend Black...or Brown...or the Natural Tone, you know what? They're all just awesome. \nAs a special gift fo Mobile Nations readers, they gave us a 10% off discount code: MNATIONS.\nBlack:https://www.satchelsatchel.com/produ...her-case-black\nBrown:https://www.satchelsatchel.com/produ...-case-in-brown\nNatural Tone:https://www.satchelsatchel.com/produ...n-natural-tone", "time": "08-24-2017 09:45 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Android Messages app stopped receiving texts after a week on my BlackBerry KeyONE", "thread": [{"postID": "post5932844", "text": "Hello,\nMy Sprint BlackBerry KeyOne is just over a week old and as of today for some reason, stopped receiving text messages from the Google Android Messages app. People are receiving texts I send from the app, but I am not receiving their texts.

Previous device that I still own is a Note 5. Been a BB user since before the days of the BB Curve. Anyway, I am having a couple issues that are driving me nuts so if anyone has any insight, please feel free to chime in.\n1) Calendar notifications for events are 50/50 meaning, some events alert me visually and audibly and some don't alert me at all. Doesn't matter if I use the stock BB Calendar, DigiCal Plus (which I've been using for years on the Note 5 with zero alert issues), SOL Calendar, etc. Calendars are synced to my Google Calendar. All work 100% fine on the Note 5. All settings on the device as well as in the calendar apps are set-up correctly. I've uninstalled and reinstalled these apps numerous times and still I get the same thing.\nHow a device built solely on productivity has an issue like this is beyond my paygrade.\n2) I have a brand new Silicone Power USB 3.0 128GB flash drive that gives me the following error when trying to access by USBTG: \"This device doesn't support this UFD 3.0 USB drive. Tap to set-up a supported format\".\nThis drive is formatted in exFat. I have three other different USB 2.0 and 3.0 flash drives, all of which are formatted in exFat that are recognized by the device. If I choose to tap to set-up a supported format, obviously it will format my drive and I don't want to do that as I have 115GB of stuff on it. The data is backed-up however, I don't want to have to reformat and reinstall back onto the drive.\n3) Just an observation, wife says call quality on her end is absolutely horrible when I call her or she calls me. Says it sounds like I'm talking from across the room. Happens even when we both have 4 or 5 service bars of signal. Probably happens on 75% of calls.\nAgain, productivity device with a productivity issue.\nAnyone else having any of these issues?\nMy main concern is the calendar syncing issue since my life revolves around calendar notifications.", "time": "07-01-2017 10:32 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5869890", "text": "On a positive note, the battery in this is as good as advertised.

Here is a bit of what I think so far, some questions I still have, and some bugs I've discovered.\u200e\nInitial thoughts!\nThis keyboard is stellar!! The keys press wonderfully, and it is so easy to type on. (Previously, my favourite keyboard was the Classic) The capacitive functionality here is more smooth and easier to predict than on the passport. The keys themselves are a clear plastic, and the underside of the keys are painted black. The silver lettering appears to be on the bottom of the key as well(but it's tough to tell. It very well could be suspended in the centre of the key) I hope these features adds to the longevity of the keyboard, and we no longer have to see paint being worn away from well used keyboards!\nI love that when I enter cursor mode, I have the option to \u200euse the arrow keys to move one character or line at a time. These arrows pop up where the predictive text typically is.\nI would like to see an update that would allow me to send a text by using the enter key, rather than using the onscreen send button.\n\u200e\nBefore the KEYone was released, I picked up a Passport and used it as a daily driver for about 5 months. I used it to practice with the capacitive keyboard. After I got the KEYone, it took about 2 days to get back to 100% speeds when typing on a normal shaped keyboard  I love that the spacebar is back where it belongs! And I'm no longer typing the $ sign when I intend to press the letter M haha\n\u200e\nI hope to see an update so that within photos, the N and P keys switch to the next and previous photos. And when viewing a specific image, I and O can zoom in and out.\u200e\u200e\n\u200e\nI LOVE how the phone hangs up quickly after a phone call! No more repeatedly clicking the end key.\u200e\nThe calendar application on the KEYone is so much easier to discern what month is being viewed!\u200e\nThe settings screen took a while to learn how to navigate. I was constantly telling myself: I've seen that screen before! Where is it?\nI think part of this may be due to how these screens and lists aren't in any particular order\n\u200e\nWithin the hub, if you type up a text, and don't send it, it gets saved as a draft. But upon backing out to the main hub screen, there is no indication of a draft in the conversation.\nOn all the BlackBerry application icons, the shading is a nice touch. It's quite subtle, and it's as if there is a light above and to the left of each icon.\n\u200e\nThank god for replacing the right shift key with CTRL. That's phenomenal. It makes selecting, copying, and pasting incredibly easy.\nI'm still getting used to androids version of the back key. I find it to be quite inconsistent. Sometimes it will go back a page, sometimes it will close a pop-up, other times it will minimize the program altogether. ...is there an application that will prevent the back button from minimizing things? That way I could just hit it repeatedly and know with confidence that I would be directed to the main page of an application.\u200e\n\u200e\n-----------------------\n\u200e\n16 Questions:\u200e\n1 if the phone is laying down on the desk, screen off, is there a way to have the screen turn on if a key is pressed? Currently, the power key is the only one that will turn the screen on.\u200e\nAnswered by Matty:\nUnfortunately not.\n2 is there a better way to quickly close all active frames? (I know there is a Clear All icon located at the top of the screen, but that is quite out of the way)\u200e\nAnswered by Matty:\nAs far as I know, the \"clear all\" is the only way to um.. clear all recent apps.\n\u200e3 what is a good way to set volume rockers to control media volume by default, rather than ringer volume?\u200e And then have a longpress of the volume rockers change next and previous tracks\n4 \u200ewhen using longpress shortcuts to change the ringer profiles, it cycles through vibrate, alarms only, and normal. But when it returns to normal, the volume changes, and becomes only ~15%. How do I fix this, so the volume isn't changed, and stays where I had it set (at ~70%)\u200e\n\u200e\n\u200e5 when using the BlackBerry device search, how do I order the search results, so that text messages or files could always be at the top of the search?\u200e\nAnswered by Matty:\nUnfortunately you can't change the way things are displayed in the search.\n6\u200e is there a way to change the functionality of the 0 key? When I'm typing, I use 0 FAR more often than Google voice. I think the 0 should be the main function, and the Google thing should be activated with a long press, or alt+press.\nAnswered by Matty:\nYou can disable the Google voice assistant if you want? This will mean every time you press the dictation key a \"0\" is selected instead of Google voice. This will save you from having to press \"alt + 0\" each time\nSettings -> Language & Input -> Blackberry Keyboard Settings -> Advanced -> Then disable \"dictation key\"\n7 file managers! What does everyone use for a file manager?? (I need one that must zip and unzip files)\nAnswered by Matty:\nCheck out the ASUS File Manager.\n\u200e\n\u200e8 how do you add custom ringers to a specific contact?\nAnswered by Matty:\nCustom ringtones can definitely be added to contacts. Open the stock Contacts App on your KEY\u1d52\u207f\u1d49. Then click on the contact you want to add a ringtone to. Then tap the pencil icon on the top right to edit it. Then click on the 3 vertical dots on the top high hand corner and then select *\"Set ringtone\"\n9 \u200ehow do you delete BBM off of your phone?\u200e\nAnswered by Matty:\nIf you do want to disable it (can't delete) simply Swipe down from the top of the home screen and tap the gear icon to enter your settings. Then Scroll down and tap Apps then Tap the app you wish to uninstall or disable, then tap DISABLE\n10 is there a way to make all of the text conversations have a uniform colour? Rather than each contact being assigned a random colour for the conversation.\n11 \u200eIn the recent applications view, I have it set to masonry. What determines the size of each tile? And what determines how they will shift around the screen, and change sizes?\n\u200e\n12 when using the keyboard shortcuts to begin to 'play a playlist', why doesn't that playlist being playing? It opens, and sits there and waits for you to press play on the screen. Is there a fix for this?\n13 I was testing the 'snooze' feature in the hub, to remind me to resp\u200eond to a text. After the reminder rang, it added a yellow line of text to the hub stating \"It is now after [date and time]\". How do I clear this notification?*\n\u200e\n\u200e14 can the convenience key be assigned to act the way the play/pause (and long-press for voice command) button works on bb10?\u200e\n15 \u200eis there a way to make*youtube videos, and regular videos (I am currently playing them through the photos application) play while the screen is shut off?\u200e\n16 \u200ewhen finished with an application, should it be left open and minimized? Or will that needlessly consume processor use/RAM?\u200e\nAnswered by Matty:\nAndroid Nougat (7.0) and later is very good at closing applications when you run out of memory so you don't have to worry to much about closing them.*\nI always close something when I'm finished with it just out of habit but you don't need to. It's not going to make battery life significantly worse if you leave them open.\n\u200e\n----------------------\u200e\n\u200e\n4 Bugs: \u200e\n\u200e\n1 if the phone is set up so typing actions from the homescreen will open the device search, and you attempt to perform a longpress shortcut from the homescrees, the device search will open and query a string of whatever character you were holding(if held for 'too long').\u200e\n\u200e\n2 when using longpress shortcuts to change the ringer profiles, it cycles through vibrate, alarms only, and normal. But when it returns to the *normal profile, the volume changes, and becomes only ~15%, rather than staying *where it was previously set (at ~70%)\u200e\n\u200e\n\u200e3 when using a longpress shortcut to lock the device, the password is required upon wakeup, and the fingerprint scanner will not unlock the device.\u200e\n\u200e\n\u200e4 Within the hub, if you type up a text, and don't send it, it gets saved as a draft.

It has to perform well for what YOU use a phone for. This phone has done that and more. The screen is awesome. Reviews or no reviews I can read the phone outside with my sun glasses on. Screen is very good. The keyone is very smooth and fast, once again review or no review. The battery is freaking incredible. I think the battery is so impressive because we have gotten use to a phone lasting about as long as a tablet less than 12 hours with moderate use. I watch videos, music, surf, ect..... Still juiced up at the end of the day. I'm also very hard on phones and I hate cases. I have destroyed me fair share of phones dropping them, sitting on them, getting crap all over them while mowing th yard or cutting down trees, and so on. I have beat the crap out of this phone (cringe worthy drop on asphalt not once but twice). Wipe it off and like brand new. This is exactly what I have been looking for.

It's definitely more of a minimalistic style approach than the DualPro, but still offers a decent amount of protection from possible surface damage or scratches. Of course, you definitely want to pair this up with a screen protector, but the case itself does a good job of retaining the look and feel of the phone, offering protection from most day-to-day hazards, without compromising aesthetics of the overall device.

So here's my little review after using my Keyone for a week in comparison to my S7 edge for a year. I bought my Keyone from Selfridge UK and use it on Telus (Canada). PS: for those having concerns about antenna bands compatibility and all, I didn't have issues. At this point, people keeps pointing specs but how does it perform in real life? Here's what I came across during my time using this phone. \n[HL]Pros (over the S7) :[/HL]1) TREMENDOUS BATTERY LIFE Did I say battery life? Yes. This phone IS the best phone I ever used in term of battery life. I consistently get 6-8h of screen on time on LTE mobile network (not wifi) in a day. If I switch between wifi and mobile network during a day, I can get about 8-10h of screen on time. On moderate use, I get about 5-6h of SOT in a lapse of 1.5-2 days of use. In comparison to my S7 edge where I get about 3-4hours of SOT for a typical work day where battery lies around 20% at 5-6pm. The battery on S7 used to be good, about 5-6 SOT, but due to poor optimization (bloatware draining battery in the background) & battery degradation...2) Optimization & softwareThe phone is fairly optimized and smooth in my day to day tasks. The blackberry launcher is not that great compared to Nova launcher where you can tweek every single thing. The icon packs option is very limited because you can only apply the whole pack. But I found an app called ''Awesome icons'' where you can modify any single icon without a launcher, root, etc ! I unlocked the developper mode to make animations and transitions to 0,5x to make it feel fast. The only thing missing is the animation speed '' Faster than light'' from Nova to make this phone perfect. Otherwise, the phone itself is very smooth I didn't encounter any lag or stutter unlike the s7 edge (mostly while scrolling where you can notice some frame drop/skip''. Update is pretty quick, I did get an update not long ago for the blackberry keyboard where on snapchat the virtual keyboard pops out everytime I type something. Blackberry is aware of some issues and are working hard to patch it as soon as possible (unlike samsung *cough*). People talk about RAM issues and all, so far I didn't have any major slow down when I have about 4-6 apps in the background. I can notice some lags when I have heavy apps in the background like Facebook & youtube but that's just minor. Personally, I close all apps everytime I'm done with them so I just keep the ones i'm using and it's all smooth. The only reason why I use the Blackberry launcher over Nova, is because of the shorcuts. I think it's fair to say it's the most conveninent feature for having a PKB. My home is now much cleaner and all my most frequently used apps are binded to a key and also placed in a folder. God I missed that feature (previously used a Bold 9000 & 9900). I think the ''Faster than light'' animation speed & icon customization is not worth the use of the shortcuts.3) Speaker and sound quality Personally, I find the Keyone to sound much better when playing a song with the speaker. The volume is loud and the sound is clear with a grain of bass better than my s7 edge. Call quality is very good, just like the old blackberries 9000 & 9900. I'm not saying S7 is bad either, but I feel the call quality is on par with the old blackberries which was really good and where Blackberry made their name from!4)Fingerprint scanner & Double tap to wakeThe fingerprint scanner on the Keyone is a no match to the S7 edge! It's blazing fast and reliable. Unlike the S7 edge where the screen has to be on or the home button has to be pressed to be recognized, I can simply rest my finger on the scanner and it will immediately unlock my phone (no need to push the button or screen to be ON to unlock my phone). I find the double tap to wake much more useful and wish it was also on the S7 Edge. Of course, there's Always-on Display, but it's still draining battery 1% an hour and power users like me won't take that chance so Double tap to wake IS the thing!5)KeyboardI think we all know that the major selling point is also the keyboard. I was also sceptic about the keyboard being glossy but after a week, it's just a matter of getting use. Typing on it is so satisfying and reminds me of my 9000 and 9900. Key travelling wasn't as good because the buttons are not as pronounced as previous devices but it's still good and I found myself typing just like before. So guys, DON'T worry about it you'll LOVE it. It's so satisfying to type on a PKB. I almost forgot why I always had a Blackberry before (i'm just 25 BTW). I have to admit I can't type as fast as on a virtual keyboard as other reviewers said, but the accuracy is much better and the best : you can type without watching the keys once you're used to so you can type more efficiently and accurately including with the symbols and shifts/alt. I didn't use a DTEK or PRIV so the flicking/swiping up gesture for word prediction is new to me. I'm not used to it yet, but I can see why people would use it to type faster. Personally, I still select the suggested word on the screen.6) NO BLOATWAREGosh, now I see why people like stock android so much. Coming from S4, Note 4 & S7 edge, I can understand why people hate so much touchwiz and their bloatware. The keyone is so much cleaner, i'd say almost stock without the blackberry implementation like Hub or calendar etc. It's so smoother and less batterry drain from bloatware that I was used on my samsungs.\n[HL]Cons (over the S7) :[/HL]\nI would like to say most cons are not major points but rather some preferences. 1) Camera (Low light) Despite the fact that the Keyone use the same sensor as the Pixel, the S7 edge still take better low light pictures. It all comes down to image processing so maybe we can expect an update in the future? Personally, I prefer oversaturated and shaper images from the S7. In day light, both perform very well, that said pictures can still be modified afterward to my preference so it's not a big deal. In low light, the S7 takes better pictures but with noises while the Keyone is opposite, ok pictures but very less noises \nFronfacing camera is better on the Keyone for selfies. Less noises and better colors. I hate the fact that I don't have the option ''Save as previewed'' like my Samsung. I always have to flip my picture after, but i'm sure there's a way to get the option through an app or something2) Screen brightness & sharpness I think we all know it's a 1080p vs Quad HD screen Amoled. Of course it's a no match when it comes to brightness and sharpness. But I still give the credit to Blackberry for putting a good screen still. I initially thought it would be a big tradeoff because I use my phone for social medias and media consumptions but it's not as bad as I thought. I still enjoy it on my Keyone, but ofc it's more enjoyable on an Amoled screen. For me, I'd still use a keyone as my daily driver whatsoever. The keyone is not as bright outdoor in comparison, but it's still usable not a big deal!3) Convenience key & Buttons locationYes for me it's a con because of it's location!!!! Even after a week, I still find myself hitting accidentally the convience key when picking up my phone or while holding. They placed a bit too low so holding the phone is a bit weird in a one-handed use. The phone is meant to be two-handed use for typing, but still achievable with one just not as comfortable. I'm still confused about the volume rocker being on right side but it's not a big deal. I only wish they had placed a bit on the upper side. I also find myself hitting the convenience key while calling which double as a mute key so sometimes I end up being confused haha. I think a bumper should fix this issue personally so I can clearly see the button emplacement while holding the phone. I'd be such a waste to put a case on this beauty so a clear bumper around the phone should fix this issue.4) Headphone jack output I can notice a little drop in sound quality from the headphone jack compared to my S7. Nothing major, just a little drop. I think we all know from the start that this phone is not meant to be used for entertainment.5) Samsung features / app I was surprised to see how I missed a few apps/features from samsung. Starting by the '' Scroll to capture'' option where I can take a long screenshot instead of fragmented ones. There's also a ''Blue light filter'' missing on the Keyone but i'm sure it's not a problem with an update, still a useful feature. Theme option is missing, I used to choose one with deep black amoled so less battery drain but hey it's not a problem anymore  But I still miss the deep black across my device. There's a dark theme on the keyone, but it's not across the device only on selected places. The ''Schedule message'' is also a feature that I miss, but i'm sure there's an app for that :P I hate the android message used as default for SMS, so I use Textra which is a mile better in term of customization. Somehow, I like the simplicity of the stock one on Touchwiz, it's just a preference.6) Lack of android pay, Samsung pay (Only in Canada for now) So far I can't use mobile payment like my Desjardins mobile payment app that I had on my Galaxy. But Android pay is coming it's way to Canada this summer so it won't be a matter anymore. No Samsung pay in Canada so far unless I have a CIBC credit card, meh...\nOverall, I wouldn't come back to my S7, but I can see myself switch from time to time. The battery and the PKB on the Keyone is so satisfying to use my S7 again. I'll still keep my S7 to take pictures tho, as I tend to prefer it over my Keyone. Whatsoever, the Keyone still take decent photo ! I'll eventually update this review with a few samples side to side. Same thing for battery life.

I'm excited about both the hardware and Android N, but the real test will come after I have the phone. What's always happened in the past is that, after trying an Android phone for a couple of weeks, and getting it all configured and working, I run into a very busy period, with lots of air travel and mobile work, and I jump back to my Blackberry Passport because it just lets me work faster and more accurately. Part of that is the keyboard, and part is my preference for all the functions that are fully integrated into the BB10 OS. Most of my work is pure communications and Internet work, so I don't use many third party apps.\nI suspect that it will come down to whether or not Office 365, including Skype for Business, works well on Android. I've tried the apps on my iPad, and was far from impressed. I don't have these apps on my BB10 phone, so the thought is that, if I can use them, that will be a win for Android.
