You will end up paying similar to what you pay for an S7 if not more. That is because it only comes with a charger and that's it. No headphones, nothing... just a plug and a cable for the weird new form of USB that it is equipped with. So it won't really be compatible with any of the chargers you own, you have to buy more if you want to have one for the home and another for the office, and then for the car as well.

I was strongly considering a Nexus 6p 64gb just for the slightly larger screen but every phone has issues, whether it be the muffled voice or rotation as example not working on the 6p I opted for the OPO3 not because it does not have faults but rather it just has better hardware.\n \r\nA Snap 820 is better than a 810 and a 530 better than 430 and Dash charging better than fast charging and handling the OPO3 easier than 6p.

Great, premium\u00c2\u0097if somewhat generic\u00c2\u0097design aesthetic. Beautiful screen (1080p is perfectly serviceable for anything but VR, and it helps save on battery life). Logical placement of all the controls, buttons and (user-assignable) capacitive keys. And dat notification slider, tho\u00c2\u0097wonderful, practical design. \n \r\nUnder the hood I\u00c2\u0092m really fairly pleased as well. This phone is as fast and stable (and 100% less explodey) as the Note 7 it replaced\u00c2\u0097a phone that costs OVER DOUBLE the OP3\u00c2\u0092s asking price. I\u00c2\u0092ve had only one app crash in a month and even that seems like an app issue, rather than the phone\u00c2\u0092s core hardware/software. \n \r\nThe camera will be an issue for some people as it falls squarely into the \u00c2\u0093fine\u00c2\u0094 range. It\u00c2\u0092s by no means bad, but nor is it class leading in any way. The software\u00c2\u0092s good and it consistently produces pretty good shots in a variety of conditions. But that 200-series Sony sensor just can\u00c2\u0092t compete against current, more expensive, flagship cameras. Still, fine is good enough for me in the camera department. \n \r\nHeard the phone\u00c2\u0092s launch firmware had some memory management and battery life problems but I haven\u00c2\u0092t experienced either in day-to-day use and I can usually squeeze a (acceptable, if a bit unimpressive) full day of frequent but untaxing use out of the device. Fast (or Dash, as it\u00c2\u0092s branded here) charging does work really well and helps make up for the somewhat \u00c2\u0093fine\u00c2\u0094 battery life. Word of warning, though\u00c2\u0097OnePlus\u00c2\u0092 Dash charging ONLY works with their proprietary Dash Charging cables AND proprietary Dash Charging wall adapter. Not a big deal for me but YMMV. \n \r\nOn the software and OS side, it\u00c2\u0092s more of the same\u00c2\u0097not a bad thing in this case. The Oxygen OS skin is light and doesn\u00c2\u0092t seem to be slowing anything down (which, honestly, is all I really require of an Android skin) and actually manages to add in some useful/fun features. Being able to change your notification LED color is nice, if somewhat useless. Screen-off pattern commands are limited but work well (draw a V on the screen to turn the flashlight on or off, right arrow to skip to the next song, etc). But the real standout features are the ability to customize your capacitive keys to your liking. Want to launch you camera with a double-tap of the Home key? Sure. Want long-press Back to open up your last used app? No problem. Want to swap the Back and Recent buttons to make it feel more Samsung? You got it. I don\u00c2\u0092t know why this simple customization feature isn\u00c2\u0092t on all phones. \n \r\nNot everything about the OS was great though, and I did find the lack of Home/Lock screen and app drawer customization a little annoying. Still, it was nothing Nova Launcher couldn\u00c2\u0092t fix and the performance hasn\u00c2\u0092t taken any kind of hit from the change. \n \r\nSo a month in, and I\u00c2\u0092m really pretty pleased with the OP3. Pleased enough, in fact, that I am seriously considering sticking with OnePlus for the OP4 next year. But there are a couple things that I would like to see before I give OnePlus my money next year. \n \r\n1) Waterproofing. I know this is a feature some people don\u00c2\u0092t care about but for me it is the single biggest feature I would like to see added for the OP4. And, conversely, if there is one thing that might entice me back to Samsung or Sony, it\u00c2\u0092s a LACK of waterproofing in the OP4. A lot of people live in rainy places and this is a big deal where I live. I would have GLADLY paid an extra $50 for a ip68 model of the OP3.\n \r\n2) Better battery life. The OP3\u00c2\u0092s battery life is okay. But it could be a lot better. Almost certainly, market pressure\u00c2\u0092s gonna make OnePlus but a 2k screen in the OP4 and I hope they make sure the battery life can keep up to that change (even if they have to thicken the device a little bit to add a bigger cell). \n \r\nDo these 2 things, OnePlus, and you have my money with the OP4. \n", "date": "17 Oct 2016"}, {"text": "mi 5 s plus", "date": "17 Oct 2016"}, {"text": "Yeah\u00c2\u0097that\u00c2\u0092s absolutely not normal.

The phone is technically \"on\" and although the screen is asleep, the device is still functioning.", "date": "26 Aug 2016"}, {"text": "I've had the OnePlus 3 for over a month now and I am enjoying the phone quite a bit.\n \r\nI do have a few issues with the phone. One being the fact that when my WiFi starts to slow down, the phone completely disconnects from the network and interrupts my app use. Specifically the games I play which require constant connections to the game. This could be a rare problem, I haven't looked into it so it may be only my problem. Another issue some people may have is the camera bulge. Compared to the previous OnePlus devices, the camera was aligned with the phone casing and was not an issue. It is now an issue. I haven't had a problem with it because I purchased a case along with the phone, but for people who don't have a case, it may cause problems.\n \r\nWhen I bought the phone, I had no idea the home button was touch. It only took me a few days to get used to. I love the fingerprint scanner. It is super reliable and fast. The only issue with the scanner is that when your phone is plugged in(charging), the finger scanner gets buggy and wont read correctly. Odd issue, but I dealt with it. \n \r\nThe last important problem is not having an SD slot. I know it's a petty thing to have an issue with, but I do like the extra space, but unfortunately with this phone, you don't have that luxury.\n \r\nThe smartphone does have many qualities that I'd like to point out. The speed is impeccable. With the unique(or new advancement) 6 GB of RAM, the phone is able to function at super fast speeds. The Snapdragon 820 cards keep the phone running multiple apps simultaneously without slowing down.\n \r\nWhat I really love about the phone, is that the phone looks very slim and it somehow looks small, but don't be alarmed, the phone is just slightly smaller than the Samsung Notes and the screen size is perfect. The resolution of the screen is great and you are able to run up to 2160 at 30 frames per second. The contrast is exactly what anyone looks for as well. You are able to adjust the warmth and coolness of the screen which really helps with preference and battery life. The screen brightness in general is very bright, so in the sun, if turned to the max setting, makes for a very visible screen. The size of the screen to the size of the phone is perfect. There is barely any space left between the end of the phone to the screen size. It looks very clean in this element. The phone in general looks extremely elegant.\n \r\nThe cameras on the phone are incredible. The main camera(outfacing) is a stunning 16 megapixels and offers the clearest of photos for smartphones out there in 2016. If you're a big junkie on cameras on phones and love the way iPhones can snap pictures super fast with incredible shutter speeds, then this is your phone. The camera is way better and offers slow motion videos alike the new iPhones. It's important to know that android cameras are often(because of software) slower and the shutter speeds are slower as the phone gets older and pictures can get difficult to take and you have to hold the phone super still for photos to be clear. But the OnePlus 3 does not have that problem. With the increased speed of the phone, software and hardware can run in perfect symmetry making for a super smooth and comfortable use in any situation. The front facing camera(selfies!) is 8 mega pixels. It's alike any new iPhone. Very clear photos and a bunch of options for choice of camera use. The flash is somewhat bright. It's not super powerful, but it's enough if your in a dark close space and need a bit of light.\n \r\nAlthough the battery size is smaller than other phones its \"size\", the battery lasts quite a long time considering the size is almost 600 mAh on average lower than other phones this big. The dash charge works great. It charges almost 50% in 20 minutes.\n \r\nThe speakers on the phone are a little low quality. It's sound quality is clear, but it lacks the bass and treble sound limits. The microphone is clear. I've heard someone call me from my phone before just to test it out and it's very clear when in Skype and on regular calls.\n \r\nAll in all, this phone is a great phone. It runs incredibly fast which is a main feature, being the performance, and is what pretty much everyone looking for a phone is after. It's look is super clean and it's quite a beautiful phone. The price is what got me on this phone. It goes for $520 USD. I compared this phone very closely to the Samsung S7 Edge. In terms of performance and all the qualities of a phone, it's very similar, aside from the Samsung being the \"Edge\". The price difference is vast and for the price of the OnePlus 3, you cannot get anything better.

Last week, I found that my camera was over sensitive to light and had a lot glare in my pictures.  Closer examining the unit and found camera glass was cracked.  I contacted oneplus 3.  They emailed me a shipping label to send back for evaluation (to see if it was due to user's fault). Well, nothing was specified in the email so I had to call service.  Well, there are a couple of issues here.  1.  It will take approximately 10 days for shipping in/ fix/return --- meaning I won't have a phone to use for more more than 10 days!  2.

Many of the users wanted to know if OP3 can really match other high end smartphones available in market? Like samsung, apple, LG. Here is the review.  \r\nIts been a week now that I am using op3, surprisingly I cannot expect if any of the manufacturer company can provide such a wild beast in such a low price.  \r\n-->> Starting of with the battery, it provides you the good battery backup atleast more than what you can expect from the smartphone, and a big thanks to the Dash Charging who can  charge up your full smartphone in approx 45 minutes. \r\n>> Camera wise, its the best performing smartphone, that we have currently in the market. Sharing one experience with you guys, took some pics from OP3 as well as from Iphone 6. One plus 3 took some amazing pics that left behind iphone with a high margin.  Excellent camera quality in outdoor conditions and well as in low light. Superb OP3. \r\n>>performance wise, no one can raise question to it, if some one is doing that, may be that guy is the volunteer of AAP(:)). How can one think that phone is going to lag or hangs when they are providing you 6gb ram, isnt a joke?  \r\n>>display, it has a bright display which can adjust itself in sunlight accordingly. Bright and vivid colors and superb body design which fits to your hand perfectly. \r\n-->Conclusion- It is one of the phone that can compete with all other smartphones price above 45k. So its better to use the brain than go with advertisement or paper wriiten specs. \r\nOne of the girl asked if she buys galaxy s6 edge or op3, I would strongly recommend you to go with op3, to get the much higher specification and the combination of everything a user can expect. And also you are going to save money that you can use for your party:) \r\nAt the end, I would like to tell you all that I am not related with any of the site, I am just like you people, a common user but yes a little bit tech savy. So if you like my post, please do hit LIKE OR REPLY and I will try my best to reach you people asap. And in the next blog of mine I will share the pics of my OP3 that I took.

First I haven't bought my phone yet and I am over 2 months here and there reading and watching all I find in order to make the best choice.\n \r\nI was a OP3 enthusiast, I was convincing myself that OP3 not only was cheap but was also something amazing, perhaps better than S7 (I would focus on some stuff and ignore other).\n \r\nHowever there is one small details you are ALL missing:\n \r\nOP3 has a limited market, you can buy it in OP website and some other partners, with a fixed price. (in my region 399\u00c2\u00c2\u0080)\n \r\nNow, Samsung S7 can be found in many e-commerce platforms and that is a game changer. Where I am SS7 is being sold at 740\u00c2\u00c2\u0080. You can now find some stores that can sell it with a great discount for 600\u00c2\u00c2\u0080. In e-commerce stores you can find it for 490\u00c2\u00c2\u0080!!!!! Brand new! Many stores. Order online, and pick it up at the store, no need to pay anything up front (in case you are suspicious like me). SS7 Edge is now at 570\u00c2\u00c2\u0080. Prices drop every day around 1\u00c2\u00c2\u0080.\n \r\nSo am I going to buy OP3 for the price of 399? MORE, being dependent on the OP3 charger for the dash charge and given the fact that the phone is slippery and does not come with headphones, you need to buy the go big or go home bundle which will put a total of 460\u00c2\u00c2\u0080. 30 Euros more and get the SS7. Comes with the headphones and since you are buying it in e-commerce for another 15 euros through in a Samsung cover. \n \r\nFor not much more, you can have the flagship of Samsung. Case to say NEVER SETTLE ahahah\n \r\nMy friend already has his SS7 Edge and is amazing, the real deal. I am currently waiting for the release of SS7 Edge+ to see how it will shake the prices before I make my move (is not every time you buy a new phone, do it well or don't do it at all).\n \r\nLets face it OP3 fans:\n \r\n- OP3 has RAM that cannot manage properly. Samsung can jump from app to app with no need to reload content (see youtube vs. videos).\n \r\n- The SS7 camera is waaaaay better. Plus the video.\n \r\n- Waterproof is as useful as it is, but awesome nonetheless.\n \r\n- Screen quality is just way way above on SS7.\n \r\n- SD Card. With all the super HD pics and 4k Video where do you expect to save all that? I suppose these files must be kind of heavy.\n \r\n- SS7 is just beautiful.

I cant say a bad think about this phone. \r\nRight now even that i just started to using this phone and im forsing it a lot downloading apps chacking games and so one i have 60% battery left with 2.44 screen on time right now. \r\nSo the battery probably will be much better than s6 edge. \r\nIts super fast.\n \r\nfingerprint reader is supper fast and acurrate, much better that one on my s6 edge. \r\nJust tested it with couple of shot side by side with my s6 edge and i think i does better photos than my s6 edge at times at times similar but i cant say worse. Im ryly happy beucos i was afraid of this. \r\nBuild quality superb.\n\n \r\nI almost forgot. I ordered separately casing that I did not receive . I have not written anything about it to oneplsu and yet they sent me an email of apology and they gave me a code for 10 dollars to use in their store beucos its taking so long.

Well, it somewhat depends what carrier's network you are on.\n \r\nIf you are on Rogers/Fido/Chatr (maybe others) that operate on the Rogers network, you will at least get phone, text, and very slow (EDGE) data via the 2G (GSM) network.  Bell and Telus and their brands (Virgin, Public Mobile, Koodo, probably others) do NOT operate a 2G network at all, so that option is out.\n \r\nI am not very familiar with what frequencies Rogers uses for 3G, so I'm not sure.  Telus and Bell use 850 and 1900 MHz, so I believe either version of the phone will get you 3G service, so voice, texting, and medium-speed data (HSPA/HSPA+).  \n \r\nWhen it comes to 4G LTE Data is where you will run into trouble.  All of the big Canadian networks primarily run on band 4, which is NOT in the global version.  Band 7 is, and it is also used in at least some areas on the major carriers too, so you may get intermittent LTE based on where you are.  But missing band 4 really means your LTE support is not good in Canada.\n \r\nFor Wind....  I think you HAVE to have the North American version, as they operate on the 1700/2100 frequencies (aka AWS) for both 3G and 4G, and the global version does not support that at all.  I think you will get zero service on Wind on the global version.\n \r\nOn the North American version, you will be fine on every Canadian carrier today, Wind included.\n \r\nEDIT:  forgot to mention the OnePlus site doesn't show you the global version info because you're browsing from within Canada.  :)  (or the US)  It only shows you the specs for your region.", "date": "22 Jun 2016"}, {"text": "One plus 3 dude of course.

I had a Lenovo vibe z2 pro which had a quad HD display but one plus 3 full HD display is no less. The difference is quite negligible. The build materials are top notch and looks like an amalgamation of HTC one and iPhone 6s. Build quality feels premium and the slight curvature feels good at the edges. Camera does protrude a bit. But a case can cover it up although I prefer it without a case as it will hide it's premium built aluminum. Sound is far better than my previous handsets I used so doesn't trouble me as I have found for some people regarding audio output. Now the best part the processor and ram. I still don't understand all the fuss regarding 6gb ram but to be honest the phone feels so fast I didn't even notice how much memory it uses. 4gb or 6gb it doesn't matter bcoz for this price range I would not even if one plus 3 had a gimmick about 6gb. In short it's superfast. Camera is also awesome. Fingerprint scanner was the fastest I have ever seen. Battery was something I worried about but to my surprise it's got a lot of punch than its capacity 3000mah dictates. I have been using with full display and had all updates from WiFi and it lasted almost one day.

This is a great question, and one I faced myself!  After researching several phone options (Moto X Play, Honor 5X, Moto G4 Plus, Zenfone 2/3, others), I had finally settled and was just about ready to order an Xperia Z3+.  Things I liked about it included: better physical size for me (I have small hands, to 5.2\" is better for me than 5.5\"), waterproof (great for rainy environment I live in), good overall specs for memory/storage/performance, good battery life, etc.  Oh and the price, and overall value.\n \r\nThe main drawback was many reports of overheating due to the Snapdragon 810.  Some say it's only when recording 4K video or gaming, some say it's even taking more than a few regular photos at a time, or doing other less intense tasks than gaming and video but as a power user juggling lots of apps and such.  I would fall into that latter category.  Also, some people said the Marshmallow update solved the overheating, others said it didn't.  It was hard to get a real feel for it.\n \r\nI was about to order it on the 12th or 13th, but decided to wait for the OnePlus 3 announcement just to see how it would compare, and I was pretty blown away and ordered one just after the orders went live.  It's a bit bigger than I'd like, and not waterproof, but it has so many pluses including:  AMOLED screen (I'm a fan over IPS), double the RAM and storage (I'm okay with no SD with 64GB!), finger print reader (z3+ has none), and the 820 which is a lot better than the 810 in the Z3+. Also the metal body I think will be more durable than the glass-backed Z3+, which I was a bit worried about shattering as well.  \n \r\nI'm still not 100% sure I made the right choice but I'm excited to get my OP3 late next week.  Honestly I don't think you can go too wrong with either.  What are your priorities when selecting a phone?  If only price, the Z3+ is cheaper.  If smaller form factor then Z3+.  If large screen then OP3.  If preformance then OP3.  Convenience of the fingerprint reader will be nice too.  It's really up to you!
