I already have a iPhone 6S as my daily driver that gives me no problems and a Nexus 6 that I rarely use because the 6S is so much faster.  I'm afraid that if I get the S7 and compare it to the 6S speed wise I'm just going to be disappointed with the purchase.  To be honest I've played with the S7 like 4 times at different stores and every time my 6S feels faster but I miss Android and the S7 Edge looks so much better.  Just today I almost walked out the door with a S7 Edge at Target only because I was told that I could stack a $100 upgrade giftcard with the $100 preorder giftcard and Gear VR.  I guess they figured out that you can't stack the giftcards so I walked out the store empty handled.  $200 in Target giftcards and Gear VR would have sealed the deal.  \r\nSo now I wait to see the G5 (I want the IR blaster, on screen buttons) is any good but it all depends on price.

I actually love TW now. \n\nComing from the Note 4, the width of this Galaxy S7 Edge is near perfect. Still features a big beautiful display but it doesn't feel like you're palming a small tablet. On top of that it's a beautifully crafted device. Easy to pickup and a joy to hold in your hand. Not to mention it's fast. Everything is fast. Opening the camera is fast. Multitasking. No lag. The app drawer snaps open. The camera hardware / camera app and fingerprint scanner also score high marks in my book. Camera pro shooting mode is the camera app I've hoped Samsung would have given us for some time. I suppose better late than never. Fingerprint scanner is every bit as nice as Apple's. I hated having to swipe down on the button and I ruined my first prints because I still thought that was how it was done. I realized you just set your finger down and it reads it. Done. Whether it's to unlock the phone, input a password or use Samsung Pay it's easy the way it should be. Special shoutout to the guys who brought back the S5's expandable MicroSD and waterproof exterior design.

Maybe it is just expectations for mobile phones.  I'll let others wordsmith \"premium\".  For me, premium is paid for appearance and performance.  I'm expecting scratches and dents.  But cracked at 2 feet?\n\r\nEveryone product category has a level of expected performance, durability (and in cases of cars, Safety) for that specific category.\n\r\nUsing the analogy of a Ferrari is a bit of a stretch and false analogy.  Nonetheless, to use your analogy, For a Ferrari, you expect power/speed, quality materials, sexy appearance,  and if you hit something going 25 mph, you survive. The last part, you expect of any motor vehicle.  It's a pretty low bar.   If I drove it 200 mph, I would have NO expectation of surviving.  There are certain things you expect from a car (let alone a premium car).\n\r\nFor a premium phone, you expect power/speed, quality, some sex appeal, and if you drop 2 feet, it doesn't crack.  The last part, you expect of any mobile phone.  It's a pretty low bar.  If I dropped 20 feet, I would have no expectation of it surviving.  Mobile phones are built with the expectation of a typical life of a mobile phone.  Yes, that includes drops.  And I'm pretty sure all mobile phone manufactures do drop test and built to it.\n\r\nA friend responded that she dropped her S7 edge around 10 times with no issue.  Yes, that is what I would expect!  (ignore that that 10 drops in 2 weeks would be considered pretty clumsy by any standard).  I don't necessary understand why others have lower expectations of a mobile phone.\n\r\nAnother way to think about it is to compare to how competitors treat \"premium\".  Remember iphone 6 bend-gate?   I never thought of putting a phone in my back pocket, but peoples expectation is that a phone is mobile and doesn't bend.  Frankly I was surprised Apple made folks whole.   The difference?  A premium service for a premium product.  I'm not saying Apple is perfect.  IMHO, it is better than Samsung in their approach.\n\r\nI just did a search on google, and discover review sites warning that the S7 edge is much easier to crack.  Wish I knew that before hand.  It was my mistake to assume S7 edge would be similar quality as S6 edge +.  How many here have seen drop test of S6 on youtube?  Amazing.\n\r\nReally sad given that S7 edge has so much potential.  Now, I have to look at a $800 Samsung \"premium\" everyday.  I think others are more forgiving then me with this experience.  I've not given up on Android.

The angle to which it drops and lend also makes a big difference.

It can and will happen depending on quite a few facts, whether it is a \"premium\" device or not. \n\r\nAs a side note, Apple sell \"premium\" devices as well for the same price which also break and crack, comparing them is pointless without all the facts They'd have to be put through the exact same drop (angle, speed, material on which they drop) and even then, they'd both have angles at which they resist/survive better and worse since they're built differently.", "time": "22nd March 2016, 04:24 PM", "postID": "post65979815", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"text": "Coming from a Meizu MX5 this phone feels fantastic!
