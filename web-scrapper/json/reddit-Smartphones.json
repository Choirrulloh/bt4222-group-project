My phone screen kind of repaired itself.", "text": "Hey guys,\n\ni'm posting this because I am going crazy about this and maybe you can help me figure it out (maybe it is something so dumb that I didn't think of it lol)\n\nWell, here's the story:\nBack in 2014, i used to have a Galaxy S (yeah, the first one of the S series, and yeah, it was already old when I had it in 2014). Pretty damn slow phone. Anyway, long story short, one day I went for a walk with it in my pocket, accidentally pulled my earphone's cord, the phone got out and went straight into the asphalt. This was the result:\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/90GNp2i\n           (exhibit A)\n\nOnly the glass cracked, the LCD (is that an LCD screen? lol) wasn't affected. I always used a plastic screen cover that I believe helped keeping the glass around. Damage was pretty good but I didn't get too sad about it because a few weeks later I would be getting myself a Note 3. When that happened, the broken Galaxy S was laid to rest inside its box at the bottom of my wardrobe.\u00a0\n\nFast forward to September 2017, when i sold the Note 3 to buy my current smartphone and had to use an old smartphone until the new one arrived. Grabbed the old Galaxy S and great!, working slow and heavy like a charm.\u00a0\n\nKept using it for the next few days, until at some point whein messing around at the old phone's stored pictures I found exhibit A (that I had sent back in 2014 to my friends to show the damage) and I remembered what did the cracked screen look like. What the ****.\u00a0\n\nhttps://imgur.com/e7T0yMn       \u00a0(exhibit B)\n\nExhibit B is the picture I took with a friend's phone at the exact moment I realized that the screen was less broken (?) than before. Here are a few considerations about that:\n\n1. The phone didn't leave its box, the box didn't leave the wardrobe. Nobody repaired the screen, and that can be told because of the two major crack points found in both pictures (first one in the bottom right corner of the phone, which may be a bit harder to see in the first picture, but it's there; and the one right above the center of the screen that can be better seen in exhibits C and D below)\n2. The glass REALLY broke. It wasn't only the plastic screen protector, which btw I never replaced nor removed, it's still there holding the cracks (?) together.\n3. There is no genius joke like \"the second picture was taken before the first one and actually it was all a prank\". No, the first pic is really from 2014 and the second is really from 2017. You can tell that by:\u00a0\n- looking at the Whatsapp design that really changed over the years; and\n- well, believing me, because i really have no other pictures of it broken. hehe\n\nThese last two pictures I took tonight when I got crazy about that again (after the first euphoria about it last year, the phone went back into the wardrobe) and decided to post it here for you guys to tell me that the solution is really dumb and laugh at me.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/vBH97Ar       \u00a0- exhibit C with white background\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/eWq7LXY       \u00a0- exhibit D with black background\n\nSo, XDA - wft has happened here? Is \"screen semi-gluing itself back\" an existing technology? Did the glass pieces only rearranged back to their normal place and the cracks are still there, but less visible? Did the plastic screen cover help?

The OLED display with True Tone and 3D Touch is one of the finest ever in a smartphone, but I don't find the notch that great. Sure, you'll get used to it; but the notch when viewing videos in fullscreen would trigger me.\n\nThe S9+ wins here. Higher resolution (1440x2960), bigger screen (5.8 on the regular, 6.2 on the plus), curved screen, customizable display options (you can choose 4 types of how color is displayed as well), better screen-to-body ratio, and the embedded home button is a big plus. Oh, and there's no notch; feel free to immerse yourself in YouTube. Did I tell you that the screen's edge will light up when a notification comes?\n\nPerformance\n---------\niPhone X wins here; the optimization of software and hardware is unparalleled, and the S9 stands no chance when competing in terms of speed and processing power. Though, unless you render videos all day, you'll find the difference minuscule.\n\nBattery\n----------\nMany battery tests in YouTube place the S9 in a superior position; it lasts longer (longer than the X, Pixel 2, and many others), and there's fast charging right out of the box. Oh, and I'm pretty sure you can't charge your iPhone while it's turned off (unless the battery's dead), while you can do that with the Galaxy; helps you to quick charge faster if you're short of time. The S9 takes it here.\n\nCamera\n-----------\nWell, this ain't fair, is it? The S9 blows the iPhone out of the water. Variable aperture, better low light, 960fps slow mo with automatic motion detection capability, manual control, customizable aspect ratio, and you can control it with your voice! By the way, it also has 4k60fps.\n\nBut, the X has its tricks of its own. Portrait Lighting and front selfie portrait is really useful. \n\nHowever, you can download a Google Camera software from XDA and get better portrait photos on your Galaxy.\n\nPS: the autofocus on the S9 is insanely fast; one of the fastest out there.\n\nOperating System\n------------------\nAgain, it's preference. You are faced with the choice of an optimized and secure but simple iOS, or a fully-customizable and deep but vulnerable Android. By the way, iOS' updates are more frequent.\n(Personally, I prefer Android after using iOS for years.)\n\nFunctionalities\n---------\niPhone X offers Face ID, Animoji, 3D Touch, Raise to Wake.....and that's about it.\n\nS9 offers way more. Here goes nothing:\n\nNeed to measure your heart rate? We got you, a HR sensor is at the back. Don't want to raise your phone to look at the time? Well, Always On Display is so much more useful than Raise to Wake (and its customizable!). Need to use your phone hands free? Bixby can do just about anything, from taking photos to changing multiple settings. Need more storage? There's SD card slot! Your ultra expensive headphones are not wireless? We've got a headphone jack! Dropped your phone into the pool? IP68's got you! Need to access your camera quickly? Double press the power button! \n\nSummary\n------------\nWell, the S9 is way cheaper, and just by looking at the above already tells you that it's the better option. But, if you're tied down by the Apple ecosystem because you own MacBooks and iPads and Apple Watches, you're better off with the X.\n\nTLDR: Get the S9.", "created": 1520267463.0, "replies": [{"text": "Hey great information here!..I was windering if you could give some perspective on long term performance of andriod vs ios.

The speed it unlocks the phone at is quite fast as well.\n\n* Day to day use I have experienced no lag whatsoever. The phone is super smooth and handles multi tasking very well as I play quite a few Japanese mobages and it has no trouble swapping between them.\n\n* My girlfriend and I are big fans of the selfie camera set up as there's a wide angle and narrow angle as well and the blur background feature makes for some really nice selfies! \n\n* So far the phone has been handling gaming really well compared to my old oneplus, no heating issues whatsoever even after an hour of games and the battery lasts me the whole day with just under 50% remaining. That's to be expected since the phone is relatively new and it's bound to degrade with age but right now it is awesome. \n\n* The speakers are another good thing I found on the phone as its higher quality than my girlfriend's S6 and my friend's S7.\n\n* One thing I did notice though is that when recording videos the auto focus gets triggered a lot so the video becomes kind of \"shakey\" (not sure how else to describe it but the video unfocuses for a tiny bit then refocuses). This doesnt bother me since I'm not big on video taking but if you are then you may want to wait a bit if Samsung will release a fix for it or look at a different phone.\n\n* Another minor gripe is that since the phone is mostly made of glass its a fingerprint magnet as I've got clammy hands, however it does come with a clear case that I've warmed up to over the week.\n\nOverall it is a phone I would recommend especially if you're into outdoor experiences as I've tested its waterproofing and its pretty darn solid.

You could buy a phone that checks out with a clean MEID/ESN from Gazelle, but end up with an unusable device that you have to exchange.  Their customer support is also incredibly frustrating.\n\nI thought it was time to upgrade from my iPhone 5S. I use Ting, so I have to buy my phone outright, so I usually just upgrade to a used older model after a new one comes out.  The offerings on eBay were looking pretty bad, so I figured it would be less hassle to just go with Gazelle, as I\u2019d heard good things about them and figured I\u2019d have no problems. I was very wrong.\n\nI ended up settling on a gold 16GB iPhone SE on the Sprint network (which is compatible with Ting), since it was the best bang for the buck and I could reuse my current case. Gazelle had a good deal on one in fair condition and a quick googling showed that their fair condition phones looked better than what my 5S looked like used on eBay, so I pulled the trigger.\n\nA week goes by. No shipping email. I contact support and discover that my phone didn\u2019t pass a second inspection. Because they didn\u2019t specifically have a gold iPhone SE in fair condition, it got held up and I was told their system didn\u2019t have any way of alerting customers to this problem. I told them they really need to fix that and I was assured they were looking into system upgrades. I was offered a silver iPhone SE in good condition and expedited shipping as a replacement, so I took the offer. It\u2019s a two-day wait for the second inspection and the phone is on the way.\n\nThe phone arrives and I immediately notice it\u2019s a gold iPhone SE \u2013 not the silver one as promised. I figure, no sweat, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. But then as soon as I go to activate on Ting, I get a flag that the phone can\u2019t be activated for an outstanding financial obligation. I immediately assumed that this is the phone that didn\u2019t pass inspection.\n\nI call Gazelle and explain that they\u2019ve sent the wrong phone and it has a flagged MEID. At first, customer support tells me the best they can do is refund my money and I buy a new phone. Then I get angry and they pass me off to a senior specialist. All I wanted was a replacement to be sent, but I\u2019m told that their system doesn\u2019t allow for replacements and I\u2019d have to return the phone and make a second order. But because it was clearly a mistake on their part, I was offered a 15% discount, expedited shipping, and my refund will process as soon as they see the package has shipped. That seemed like a pretty good deal, especially since the discount could let me get a 32gb iPhone SE for less than the 16gb.\n\nI order a new phone Friday and it ships that day \u2013 oddly not having the two business day delay for a second inspection. I think nothing of it, figuring they bumped it up the queue because of the botched order. I also got frustrated that my 15% discount was something I had to call in to redeem \u2013 which took so long that I give up and send a Facebook message, which got it processed in less than 20 minutes. It beat hearing their hold music for any longer\u2026 it\u2019s a 10-20 second generic jazz riff that plays on repeat and will now be permanently ingrained into my brain.\n\nMonday afternoon, the phone is here when I get home from work. I open it up and it\u2019s in pristine condition. I go to Ting\u2019s site for activation... and I get the same message about outstanding financial obligations.\n\nI call Gazelle, livid with the fact they\u2019ve made this mistake twice. I get transferred to the same senior specialist. While on hold for a LONG time waiting for the specialist to pick up, I ran the MEID through as many checks as I could find. Most came back saying it was clear, but I noticed that Swappa\u2019s check clearly stated there was a financial obligation. In fact, it says clearly \u201cDevice is not eligible for resale (financed),\u201d yet, Gazelle still sold it to me.\n\nThe Gazelle senior rep has claims to be surprised that this happened twice in a row, but also has no clue how to fix it. He puts me on hold (jazz riff again\u2026 the horror) and claims Sprint told him the phone was deactivated a year ago and should be ready to activate. While talking to him, I go to Sprint\u2019s website to run the MEID and find that even Sprint has the activation blocked. \n\nBy now, the senior rep starts to give me attitude \u2013 and granted, I was very, very pissed off, but rightfully so, considering this is a pretty major screw up. He tells me that I need to just go to an actual store to activate the phone and it\u2019s probably the online activation. He claims he tried to check it on Sprint\u2019s site and it wouldn\u2019t even load, so clearly it\u2019s a problem on their end. I keep emphasizing that, no, it\u2019s not Sprint\u2019s fault that Gazelle\u2019s verification method is apparently flawed and apologize for being angry, but it\u2019s a frustrating situation I shouldn\u2019t be in with a company who boasts verified used phones for sale.\n\nFinally, I agree to just call Sprint, because it\u2019s clear I\u2019m getting nowhere and I already have my return label. Sprint won\u2019t give me any information without a phone number \u2013 which makes me sincerely doubt the senior rep\u2019s claims about his call with Sprint.\n\nI call back Gazelle and I\u2019m promised I\u2019ll get a call back from the rep, because he is busy with another customer. He never calls back.\n\nI call Ting, who were very helpful (as always... Ting support RULES) in explaining the issue and why they can\u2019t activate the phone. They recommend that I use either Swappa or Glyde, as their MEID/ESN checks for sellers include the outstanding financial obligation. I check Swappa\u2019s site and sure enough, it\u2019s clearly outlined in their FAQ. Gazelle\u2019s FAQ has no mention whatsoever outstanding financial obligations.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve packed up the Gazelle iPhone SE to get a refund and promptly ordered a 64gb SE from a verified seller on Swappa for a better price.\n\nOh, but it continues.\n\nI figured I\u2019d ask Gazelle for a refund as soon as my return was picked up, as they had offered that for the first order. I called and another senior rep promised it to me, but said that the previous rep I dealt with would handle it \u201csince you worked so well together.\u201d A day goes by without a notice of a refund, so I message their Facebook page. I\u2019m told they are processing it today and that it may take 24-48 hours to appear in my account \u2013 which is total bullshit, because the last refund showed up in my email and in PayPal immediately. \n\nSix hours go by and nothing, so I send another message.\n\nThen, realizing I have plenty of evidence for a potential PayPal claim against them anyway, I decide to go with the tried-and-true method of getting any company to follow through on their promises: I posted publicly about it on Twitter and tagged them. \n\nA few minutes later, I\u2019ve been refunded. Ridiculous that it took a public shaming for one of their reps to spend 2 minutes to process a refund. \nGranted, this was an early refund based on the shipping, but the simple fact that I was promised it would be processed two days in a row and it took me pushing them to actually do it is ridiculous. Had they told me it would be delayed until the device arrives, I would\u2019ve waited.\n\nI cannot recommend Gazelle to anyone based on my experience. Gazelle clearly doesn\u2019t have proper checks to make sure the phone can be resold. Gazelle doesn\u2019t have an order system that can do a basic task like a replacement for a defective device. Gazelle\u2019s shipment department will ship out a phone that hasn\u2019t passed inspection after they\u2019ve offered you a device that did. Gazelle\u2019s reps will put you on the line with a carrier to try to resolve the problems they made by not doing proper checks before selling a device. Gazelle will drag their feet in issuing refunds.\n\nIt\u2019s a terrible experience all around. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve bought two phones on eBay and not had a single problem, yet Gazelle managed to screw me over twice within two weeks and when they knew I had enough of their incompetence, they appear to have intentionally forgot to issue my refund.

Some newer phones like S8 claim their batteries lose only 20% capacity after two years. \n\nJust as an extra tip, even batteries that sit unused lose battery capacity on their own so say you buy a \"new\" battery for your phone that has been sitting on a shelf since your phone was new, then it too will have lost some battery capacity, although not as much as the one in your phone.\n\nOh and yes batteries have a certain number of full charge cycles. So the more frequently you charge your phone the quicker you reach the end of your batteries rated number of charge cycles.  The deeper you get into that cycle the lower the maximum capacity will be.\n\nIn the end I went with the philosophy of not worrying how much I use my phone or how frequently I charge it because I'll just replace the battery down the road or upgrade.

The camera is great, perfect for your means and overall, the software is flawless. There are tons of freedom and customization options the s8 provides. This by far, in my opinion, is the smartphone you should get.\n\nNow if you want a phone with the latest Android/Google software updates, buy the Pixel 2 XL. Doesn't have a better display than the S8 and has bigger bezels but the camera is the best in the market now. With Oreo, the Pixel 2 Xl has no lag and is sure to be a good phone, just a little more expensive than the S8 (not S8+). Now, in short, this is a good freedom-providing phone with a good camera, just not the best display and without the Samsung customization.\n\nNow if budget is your thing, the OnePlus 5t is the amazing route to go. As the cheapest of them all, the Oneplus 5t boasts good battery life, the stock Android software, and a good camera.

I wanted a \"cheap\" smartphone that even if it would not be the best, it would not be slow.\n\nLG G6's price at 415 euro that I got it had everything I wanted.\n\nFirst of all, big screen at 1440p with small bezels, looking very sexy. The ONLY reason I wanted for sure a 1440p phone, is because I am using it with VR glasses. 1080p screens just do not look good with VR glasses. I am not interested in VR gaming or whatnot, as much as watching films be it 3D or not. The small bezels combined with the 18:( screens, also mean that the phone is slimmer and thus, even if it's a 5.7 inch screen, it is not that hard to hold with one hand.\n\nSecond and very important is that it has a flat screen. I find curved screens very high tech and new age, but using one is not my thing. I accepted already that new age phones need a nice strong case to survive even small unlucky falls and yesterday I was proved right as for the first time I dropped it. Curved screen phones are supposedly extra fragile due to the curve and if anything they look awkward in rugged cases. Even if I was going to use one without a case that would look weird with it's curve, the way I hold my phone  works horrible with curved phones, especially without a rugged case. I just keep accidentally touching the sides, opening something I do not want.\n\nLike I already said, I wanted a stronger phone. I got my mother a Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, because for it's low price, it has a nice strong Snapdragon 625. But when I use some heavier apps with it, it sometimes can get laggy for a split second here and there. I really love it my G6 never experiences that.\n\nAlso like I mentioned it's low price. No matter what, I do not use my smartphone in a way that I would need a more expensive stronger phone. Thankfully G6's price plummeted low and that definitely was good for me.\n\nOut of worry for how fragile new phones are, I also wanted a phone that if anything happens, it's **official** service would not cost me too much and G6 seems to have ok prices for that too.\n\n**HEADPHONE JACK**. Thank god still some companies seem to keep adding one! Even if I ignore that usb-c needs either a converter or headphones that are usb-c, I firstly do not want in any way to tire the charger slot extra for headphones. Even if I ignore that too though, I find myself many times needing to use both headphones and also plug the phone on a power bank. Obviously using bluetooth headphones would solve that, but I do not care to have extra radiation on me, especially because I use headphones sometimes for long hours and let's not forger the usb headphones would be needing charging too eventually.", "created": 1516139390.0, "replies": [{"text": "The LG G6 is a huge contender on my list!

Thankfully replacing the battery is much cheaper, so I found a New, Genuine Samsung replacement battery for a reasonable price!\n\n# Product Description\n\nI've not linked to the product page in case that's not allowed *(battery MPN is EB-BT800FBE)*, but basically it's a UK eBay product page that lists the battery as \"brand-new\", and the most relevant snippet from the description is:\n\n&gt; \"We are selling 100% guaranteed premium quality battery we guarantee to meet real capacity and full cycle\"\n\n# Age\n\nI've just received it and I'm surprised to see that the manufacture date is **29/06/2015**, which was a little over **2 and a half years ago**.\n\nI was under the impression that Lithium-ion batteries had a shelf-life regardless of whether they were used or not (which is lessened even further depending on the temperature of the long term storage area), and that they have to maintain a minimum charge. Indeed, the piece of paper that the seller sent with this battery states:\n\n&gt; \"In order for the battery to work and hold charge properly please charge them for 6/8 hours for first 5/6 days. Please note new batteries might not hold charge well in the first few days as it takes them a few days to get it Settled. Avoid completely discharging lithium-ion batteries. If a lithium-ion battery is discharged below 2.5 volts per cell, a safety circuit built into the battery opens and the battery appears to be dead. The original charger will be of no use.\"\n\n[Is that accurate? I don't know much about batteries &amp; when I install this I'll be using AccuBattery to estimate capacity for a week after the first few charges...]\n\nSo, while technically never used, I wouldn't call a several year old battery *(that's almost as old as the one I'm currently using, albeit with less wear cycles)* \"**new**\" if it turns out that due to ageing it holds significantly less than the rated capacity (7900mAh). Similarly I wouldn't consider it new if the battery functions well, but turns out to age significantly prematurely due to its already advancing age upon purchase. There's the distinct possibility that Samsung haven't produced this battery for 2 years what with the tablet being a couple of years old, but still...\n\n# My Question\n\n**So my question is this: Have I been duped into buying something that can't really be considered new? Will it be worth it for me to install this battery, will it come reasonably close to meeting the retail specs as promised, or will it be disappointing?** This tablet's three years old now but good as new in all regards besides battery, and I'm looking to get another three years out of this battery. Two, at least.\n\nIf it turns out the battery isn't going to be much good I'll get in touch with the seller and ask if they have one with a much more recent manufacture date, and assuming they're cool with it I'll have to pay some postage to send the one I just received back to them and swap it with the replacement.\n\nI don't really want to return it for my money back because I could just as easily fall foul of the same issue with the next seller I find and those return fees pile up, though the eBay description *does* say that this battery is guaranteed to \"meet real capacity and full cycle\" so I guess if it doesn't perform well I *could* return it.

These androids were the cheap- get it for free if you join phones. My friends, my girlfriend (who is now my wife ), and her parents all used IPhone. I think the most compelling argument from one of my friends is how IPhone updates are designed for IPhones. In comparing this to android, when you update an android phone, it goes to all android carriers. (I.e. Samsung, Google, LG, etc.) \n\nSo, I got an IPhone 5s about 1.5 years ago. In short- I loved the simplicity, hated the keyboard. About 5 months ago I got the newest Mac Book on the market for college. To be honest, this laptop is amazing and I am not looking to convert to PC. \n\nHere are some facts about me, so I can get an unbiased response. As to what phone I should get in my lifestyle. I will also have some questions that I would like answered. \n\nI am athletic. As in, I go to the gym and I run. I need something, even a phone case- that can handle sweat. So a water resistant phone is a must. \n\nI am a huge music lover. I have prepared for a possible conversion to android, so I use Amazon Music. So this won't be a hard transition.\n\nI like to use I Message (not the keyboard) because the text go back and forth smoothly. Is there an app for this? Also, is there a texting app that I can now use for my Mac. \n\nI am currently a college student, looking at getting my masters. With that said, is there a phone that may help with this lifestyle. \n\nLooks are not everything to me. I do like how the s8 looks, but if someone can recommend something that works better I'll  look at it.\n\nI am not a fan of Apple getting rid of the headphone jack. So I would prefer I phone with it. \n\nFinally, I am willing to dish out the cash. As long as the phone lasts me longer than three years. So I would prefer a newer/better phone. \n\nOther subreddit post: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/7cidkr/im_due_for_a_new_phone_ive_had_iphones_for_5/?st=JC7RVHJM&amp;sh=0a0de718\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/7nbeay/another_switch_to_iphone_from_android_review_post/?st=JC7S0KI6&amp;sh=394ace5f\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/70sqcf/should_i_switch_to_android/?st=JC7S5YIE&amp;sh=84803a69\n\n(Sorry for formate/typos.

Unfortunately it doesn't have a headphone jack.\n\nGalaxy Note 8 will probably be the top of the line phone if you aren't worried about money, so I would go with that as it has the best screen on the market while still having the headphone jack. Expandable memory is always helpful as well, rather than having to buy into Apple's more expensive on board storage. It's also ip68 water resistant.\n\nAs for college lifestyle, it would depend on how much you use your phone. I basically used my note 8 to do everything from writing essay to watching movies to sending emails. With Split Screen apps, I'm able to do watch a video while texting at the same time, something that isn't available on iPhone. It's available on other androids too but the note 8 has a huge screen so its super comfortable when using split screen. Samsung also has a built in app called Side Sync, this allows you to wireless (or wired) control your phone through your PC/Macbook! You can even use it to answer calls onto your computer, or better yet use it to wireless transfer a document/photo from your laptop to your phone. Doesn't work the other way around though.\n\nIf you're not the type to use your phone too much, iPhone's have the best standby battery on the market. So it'll last you all day in your pocket, maybe even two days on one charge.\n\nAs for messaging apps, nothing will ever come close to iMessage imho. If you're the type to send videos through your messaging apps a lot... you'll notice that Android message apps utilize MMS for videos and it looks horrible on the iPhone's end.

The main reason is because I too am an athletic person and long time iPhone 6 user who owned a Samsung S3 prior.\n\nThe iPhone 6 is probably one of Apples greatest achievements in the years they produced smartphones. Same can go for older generation MacBooks. I really enjoy using my iPhone 6 right up until now as a secondary phone to my current LG G6 Android smartphone.\n\nMy LG G6 was just over half the price of an iPhone 8. It is about the same size as the 8 but LG did manage to fit a screen that is larger than the iPhone 8 Plus in there. The phone came with an additional 64GB of storage in the form of a SD card. I now have my entire music library on my phone and I snap up pics and videos whenever i want, no worrying about space like i did with my iPhone 6.\n\nThe G6 has an 18:9 aspect ratio which means i can multitask by splitting the screen in exactly half and i usually use the top half for YouTube whilst the bottom has twitter. Something i cudnt do with the iPhone.\n\nAndroid really has come a long way from the days of the S3. Their apps look amazing and are about on par with Apples App Store.\n\nOne of the snags is that the Apple App Store has some really awesome exclusive apps that will never see the Google Play Store. I miss my Pacemaker music app as well as GarageBand. There may be Android alternatives but they just cant compare. Also the sound quality on an iPhone is uncontested. Because the iPhone and the software are made by the same company, the latency is kept to a minimum. Unlike Android phones that marry hardware and software from two different manufacturers.\n\nIf you are still skeptical then i advice going for a cheap Android again just to try out. The Honor 7X at $199 is amazing because Cheap Android smartphones have become really good and can compete with mid range smartphones nowadays. Look it up.\n\nAnother alternative is the OnePlus 5T which is just over $500. This is a great flagship phone at an affordable price.

Its warranty ended around the 10th of March, and a few days later the phone died. I never installed any custom rom nor did I root it, the phone was using the official ROM from Samsung and all the updates installed were from Samsung.\n\nThis situation happened after I installed the latest software update from Samsung, the phone got stuck in a black screen with the blue led always turned on, I tried secure boot and recovery both weren\u2019t successful. I called Samsung and I was told to take my phone to a shop so that their technical experts could analyze the problem.\n\nI did so and their experts said that it was an issue with the motherboard and that the motherboard needed to be replaced, which I found strange because the smartphone never showed any signs of defect and it was working as nicely as when I bought it. They told me that repair price was around 270\u20ac. I strongly asked them to contact Samsung as the warranty had ended only a few days ago, but to no surprise Samsung did not accept any charges and I would have to be the one paying the repair cost.\n\nI did not accept this solution, I contacted Samsung multiple times and no alternative solution was presented.\n\nIn all this process I felt mistreated and disrespected by Samsung\u2019s customer support.\n\nSo given this I will not be fixing my S7 nor will I be buying any Samsung device ever again and I am here searching for alternatives.\n\nThanks in advance.", "created": 1522230700.0, "replies": [{"text": "Oneplus 5T imo.

Current Swappa prices for brand new P2XLs are so low right now (hovering between $550-600). Now, my X was already paid off, so for me I'm going to pocket the extra $250 and sell off my Series 1 Apple Watch and just watch what happens with Apple later this year. I, too, couldn't get past how amazing the camera is (and it is!). I'm also a MacBook user and own an iPad Pro 10.5\" and I also dabble back and forth between Android.\n\nA few things: I have Airpods. If you set up the functionality ahead of time on an Apple device (e.g. Double-tap right ear = pause, double-tap left ear=skip track) it works on Android with no extra tweaks! Fantastic! I did download an app to show me the battery life and case battery life and it was a.) free and b.) while not perfect, definitely fills the void. \n\nRE: gestures, because you're not going to want to give those up, there's an app called Gesture Control that mimics the iPhone X's swipe up to dismiss the app and swipe up and hold to find the app switcher. Your on-screen buttons still stay there, but I don't even notice them and I actually like having them there still in many apps. \n\nRE: Battery life, so far so good. Too early to tell but it holds a charge nicely (we'll see as I get to the end of the days)\n\nRE: 'Will I regret switching once I make the leap?' Always and forever the eternal question for those of us who enjoy Android AND iOS. I think now more than ever there are customizations and apps that allow for as close to iOS as you'd like to get if you want. Plus with Android P coming up with more real-time/preview images/texts and screenshot editing, I think it'll be the closest it's ever been. \n\nI actually like the screen a lot on Saturated mode. It's a little dull on the other modes, but you'll find your favorite with three options to choose from. \n\nOne thing I was surprised about is the speakers, while louder on the 2XL are nowhere near as crisp as the X. I was a little bummed there because I imagined having even better speakers, but they're still good by all accounts. \n\nIt's only been a day, but as a previous owner of a Nexus 5 and 6P and Galaxy S8 I kind of knew what I was getting into. I can't say for sure this phone has ruined me on iOS. In all honesty, I'm sure it hasn't. I feel destined to switch to iOS every fall and Android every spring until somewhere, someday a company makes that majestic unicorn phone that handles it all! \n\nI definitely don't feel it's a step down by any stretch. There are more options to customize on the P2XL but also less of that 'it just works' feel. You know what I mean, I'm sure. The color of the panda P2XL is gorgeous and I've already had two people in the last 6 hours ask me what phone I have, something that never happened with my X. Does that matter?

The Adreno 512 video card is also way better than the Adreno 506 in the Moto and the Mali-T830 MP2 in the Huaweis.\n\n3. The Huawei has an ugly sluggish EMUI skin on top of the stock Android. Both the Moto and the Nokia come with a stock one but the Nokia has Android One which means that, in a sense, it's even more stock than Moto's and Google controls the updates themselves which means that there is absolutely no downtime. Android 9 comes out - you're getting it almost immediately. It will also be a lot more responsive, especially compared to a Huawei.\n\n4. Depending on the region the Moto and the P Smart can have 3gb of RAM which is far too little even for today, let alone for future-proofing. The Mate 10 Lite and the Nokia 7 Plus have 4gb which is much better.\n\n5. The Motos have an extremely old-fashioned design. An 18:9 aspect ratio screen with hardly any bezels feels really good, actually, and I think the Nokia's implementation is quite good.\n\n6. It has a 3800 mAh battery compared to the 3000's of the Moto and the P Smart and the 3340 of the Mate 10 Lite. Should last you quite a bit longer.\n\n7. The dual cameras on the back, as well as the front-facing one, have Zeiss optics and judging by the samples I've seen it's light years away from the Moto and, especially, the Huaweis.\n\n8.

Unlike all of those photos it doesn't have MicroUSB but USB Type C which is superior, more durable and easier to use.\n\n10. It's pretty much guaranteed to have far greater build quality than any Huawei. Most probably it's better than the Moto as well.\n\n11. It's not Chinese.\n\n\nIt's releasing at about 400 euros which is just as much as the Z2 Play (basically the same as the G5S but with AMOLED screen) and around 100 euros more than the Mate 10 Lite but you won't find any better camera for a lower price than that, honestly. If you still want to drop 100 bucks you can get the Nokia 6 (2018) that should be coming soon as well. It's a pretty similar phone with toned down specs.

The Moto G5S Plus is a really good phone for its price, I just think that the Nokias offer more for the buck and are also newer.

They would likely keep their dated design, though, and I highly doubt they'll offer as much for the buck as the Nokias. I think Nokia is really pushed by both HBM and Google to be able to eventually offer an alternative to Samsung in the premium range and they're basically making smartphones on a loss right now doing so.\n\n\nYour other option is always a Xiaomi but I have absolutely no experience with them and, yet again, they're a Chinese company like Huawei. While their build quality has been better than Huawei's recently, I think, their phone range, UI and copied designs are just as weird. The good thing about Xiaomi is that some of their phones come with the same Android One as in the Nokia which means instant updates. Though I think theirs is slightly skinned and uglier.\n\n\nbtw To just see how weird Huawei is - except for the P Smart and the Mate 10 Lite there are also the Honor 9 Lite, the Honor 7X and the P20 Lite.

Also, if youre looking for some good smartphones nowadays, I can give you some suggestions.\n\nMore expensive Premium Phones:\nSamsung Galaxy S9: The newest phone in Samsung's S Series, it comes with top of the line specs and is quite filled with features. Has a great camera and an amazing display. Its for $800 or $33.33/month, if youre on verizon.\n\niPhone 8+: There is also the slightly newer iPhone X, but it costs more and honestly I can't find reasons to justify spending more money for a slightly bigger screen. It has the same processor and power as the X, so there is no use in buying the  X. The has a great screen and comes with iOS, arguably the best operating system. Nothing more to say about it besides the fact you'll get a very clean experience. For $700 or $29.16/month on verizon.\n\nGoogle Pixel 2: Google's latest phone, is probably the fastest Android phone you can buy. It has a very sleek software experience, similar to the iPhone 8+'s, and comes with pure Android. Pretty solid choice. $650 or $22.92/month on verizon.\n\nMid range phones:\n\n*note: from here on you will find only android phones. nothing from Apple. \n\nOne Plus 5T: It's a phone that compares with premium smartphones and yet is a few hundred dollars cheaper. Is very fast and reliable. Good choice if youre on a slight budget. $500, but thats if you buy it on their website. Verizon doesnt seem to offer this phone.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7: One of Samsung's slightly older flagships. While it is a bit dated, it still is reliable and will hold out for 2 years. It will come with the next 2 versions of android. Not a bad choice if youre on a budget, but would still recommend the 5T. $480 or $20/month on verizon.\n\nCheap low range phones:\n\nSamsung J7 V: It's one of samsungs cheaper phones, made specifically for consumers looking for a cheap phone. It's good for its price, and comes with Android 7 (or called Nougat). Again, just if youre on a larger budget this would be my most recommended choice. There are other low range phones but this is the one I would choose. Samsung generally makes good cheap phones.\n\nKeep in mind these are not the only options you have. There are many more available at your carrier, so you should probably ask them as well. Ask them what you are looking for, how much you use your phone, etc. I should also tell you there are 2 operating systems. One is Android, which is used by Samsung and many other companies, like One Plus, HTC, LG, Google, and others. It is good if you like customizing your phone, as it restricts you less. iOS is used by Apple for its iPhones. It is generally a smoother experience (at least for most people), and gets constant updates. You should also ask your carrier for more information. Make sure to specify this is your first phone, so they don't rush too much when telling you everything.\n\nGood luck finding a phone! Take your time on choosing a phone, because you will most likely be using this phone for the next 3 - 4 years (maybe more) and you want to make sure that you have a phone you are comfortable with.

They see popular people and celebrities with the latest iPhones so they want that. A lot of them generalise all android phones with being that shitty budget phone they had first and not the beautiful premium flagships from the likes of Samsung and google etc... And then they are too closed minded to learn that there are other phones that are much better and even cheaper. They like their iPhone and howost of them are near enough the same and it rarely changes from next generation so they're happy with what they have so when their older iPhone slows down they don't look at all the other options they just want another iPhone. \n\nSome reasons I've heard from iPhone users on Android phones are, \"they're complicated and I can't work them\", \"they don't look nice\" and so on. \n\nYou often see people with Apple products blatantly showing them off in public, like getting a MacBook out at a caf\u00e9 or showing each their new iPhone and Apple watch so they. \n\nSome apple users would go against android saying they're just copying apple. This is true as there's a wave of notches and iOS based themes on Android but then again apple is the company that introduces a feature as brand new when it's been on an android since 2012.\n\nThere's also the apple ecosystem. You can have things like facetime, iMessage and everything linking together which is a really good feature of apple devices so they don't want to get out of the ecosystem. They then don't like android because you can't have facetime or iMessage so they're \"not as good\".\n\nDon't get me wrong, some Android users are the same. They are stubborn because their device has better features or is cheaper or something. Also, apple has a very locked down system which has its ups and downs. For example it is incredible hard to root or 'jailbreak' an iPhone and there's almost no customisation, so android users would not get on saying you can't make it yours. \n\nThis is just a series of ideas that came into my head when I read  the question so take them with a pinch of salt haha but like you said, both the highest end iPhones and Androids are both practically identical with features, great cameras, fast, good battery like etc...

My first Android phone was a Samsung phone. A big block of a phone it was. 5.8 inch display, I really liked it. I'm from India so iphones cost a bit more here. iPhone X base model costs 1400$ here. So back when I was first using Android phones, the only people who used iPhones were rich people. That's still the case somewhat. And there were no carrier locked phones which you could pay for on monthly basis. Only this year it has started so we had to pay the full price. So the Android vs iOS issue is a bit stronger in India. \n\nAs for the fundamentals, both have their pros and cons. iOS is smooth, fast, simple. It's for people who just want a phone that works all the time. iPhones in general have very few hardware and software issues with them. It just gets things done.\n\nAs for Android customization is the name of the game. You have an option to change everything including the launcher. And they cost less. India is a very budget oriented market. Phones less than $300 are very popular in India. That's why last year xiaomi overtook Samsung in volume of sale in India. \n\nIn the end both have their pros and cons and most importantly a fan base. Android fans will always complain that iOS doesn't have customization, the lock screen shortcuts are atrocious and they cost too much. iOS fans will say Android copies iOS all the time and they have a lot of software issues.

It's simply a better device, objectively speaking.\n\nI compiled a small list of specs collected from www.gsmarena.com.\n\n\nA7 vs A8\n\n\nAndroid 6.0.1, upgradable to 7.0  vs Android 7.1.1\n\nThis is important, especially if you plan to use the device for a long time. Samsung are very slow to release android updates, so starting off  with a newer base version means that you can expect to get more updates, more often. Starting with a phone released with an earlier version of android, can sometimes mean that you can't expect a lot of updates of your device. Remember that android 8.1 is the current version and the developer version of 9.0 is already out.\n\n\n\nExynos 7880 vs Exynos 7885\n\nA higher clocked processor. The 7885, is divided into six A53 cores and two A73 cores. The 7880 is made up of eight A53 cores. For day to day usage, this equates to being better at handling big loads, for extended periods of time.\n\n\n32 GB vs 64/32 GB\n\nIn my own experience. If you are able to get the 64 GB model, having more internal storage (even though you can expand), ensures a device that will remain more stable and more responsive/quicker over time. Simply because filling up your storage slows the phone down.\n\n\n3 GB RAM vs 6 GB RAM\n\nDouble the memory is better for multitasking or if you like to use a lot of different apps. Having to keep launching apps is frustrating.\n\n\nf/1.9 vs f/1.7\n\nA bigger aperture (smaller number is better), allows more light to enter the camera. This is important in small smart phone cameras, because the aperture is not variable. Having a better starting point is important. In photography, it's much easier to remove light instead of adding light. This is especially true in low light conditions.\n\n\nn/a vs 24-bit/192kHz\n\nA better DAC equals better sound. If you like to listen to music and you have a decent headset, this should give you a noticeable difference in quality and fidelity.\n\n\n4.2 vs 5.0\n\nA newer version of bluetooth. 5.0 allows connection to two devices simultaneously. It also has twice the transfer speed and better range. Also, simply having newer technology in your device is better for the longevity. In respect to technology, as new standards are rolled out it's very disadvantageous to not be able reach the full potential.\n", "created": 1522694794.0, "replies": [{"text": "Thank you very much!", "created": 1522695705.0, "replies": []}]}, {"text": "A8+ if you have to go Samsung, but I'd recommend looking around for another brand if possible", "created": 1522658692.0, "replies": [{"text": "If I may ask, why?

I think a good way of explaining this is that it is a common language every Android Oreo device has of communicating with the hardware. Before this every phone had it's own way of speaking to the hardware, implemented differently by every manufacturer.\n\nThis enables you to run a customized version of Android (custom rom) on your phone without major modifications and with almost compatibility.  This was possible before, but it was much more difficult.\n\nROMs are created by hobbyst developers unrelated to the original manufacturers of the phone. The cool thing about roms is that they let you keep using your device with the latest software updates even if the manufacturer stops supporting it.\n\nBefore project treble it was more difficult to provide 100% compatibility with the hardware. So, for example, in some phones the camera would be really bad if you installed a custom rom. Since these devices are now all sharing this \"common language\" developers can create only one custom rom and have it work across all devices with good compatibility.\n\nHope my explanation was good enough. \ud83d\ude05\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Pixel 2 also has project treble, but it isn't as necessary since it gets the latest updates directly from google.

The moto g3 is fine, (I can play pubg on it fine haha), so I'll be fine to use it for a few more months. I wanted a phone before I go on holiday in late July. The options I was considering were, Samsung s8, Oneplus 5t, HTC u11+ and the pixel 2 XL. My budget is around \u00a3500 and you get all of them for around that price somewhere in the UK. Although, despite that, I was wondering whether it would be worth the wait for the upcoming Oneplus 6. I was wondering which option would be the best and if there are any other devices I'm missing out. I'm not fussy about having a headphone jack, although, I would like an 18:9 screen size (or bezel-less kinda situation), wireless charging is meh, it's good if you have it and a very decent camera and battery life. Preferably android 8.0 or 8.1 would be niceeee. One feature I would find very useful but can just about live without would be dual sim.

The battery life isn't super great. Google pixel 2 XL has that notorious screen issue that everyone has talked about. While it's not terrible it's not as good as its similarly prices counterparts. OnePlus 5t doesn't have any cons for that price but the camera doesn't have Optical image stabilization like all the others. So the low light performance of the camera won't be as good as the others. HTC has one of the dimmest displays on any phone out there. So outdoor usage will be a pain.\n\nSo you need to decide what you want the most.

The phone comes with a quick charger and good quality earphones. The battery life of the S9+ is significant. S9+ is definitely the best phone Samsung has ever made.
