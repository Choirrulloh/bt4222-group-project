I have had multiple issues with the external memory card failing as an external application so I thought adoptive would be the answer. Until it stopped installing.\nNow my internal card is missing files and directories that were stored on the non functioning adoptive card. Meanwhile my most favorite music playing software will not search the external card now for the music stored there. I tried all kinds of combinations including allowing the phone to format the external card and reloading hours of data through the phone onto the external card (slow). I've stopped the Mixer app, deleted it's data and cache hoping it would reread and locate the external card. I reloaded the app. I used a music scan app hoping it would leave a command on the internal storage for the Mixer app to find the external card with the music.\nWhen the adoptive setup crashed and I looked at my internal card there is a whole lot of files missing that were usually showing on the internal. Fortunately, the inability of the Mixer App to find the mounted external card seems to be my only issue. I lost over 9 months of data that was either moved to the adoptive or deliberately stored there. The photos lost were irreplaceable.\nI realize a full factory restart might be in order just by noting what is no longer showing on the internal drive. It's confusing why the internal no longer shows multiple files and details but still functions fully.\nAgain my focus and issue is that the Party Mixer app is not locating the external card where the music is.
