After that drop I had a few accidental drops with it but nothing else happened to either of it's glasses!  \r\nIt must have been the perfect drop at it's weakest spot I guess, because otherwise the back would have more cracks since then.\n \r\nWell myself obviously haven't done a drop test, but it fell off my hands twice (one facing with it's back on a pavement side), and nothing happened to it except 3 very small scratches at the right metal frame.", "date": "24 Apr 2017"}, {"text": "Well Z5 is my very 1st smartphone so I can't answer that.

The Xperia z3 is a fantastic phone and my first smartphone that i truly loved, but because it uses a normal glass and not a gorilla glass it gets scratched and scuffed like nothing else and were not talking tiny scratches, the frosted glass on the back of the z5 helps TREMENDOUSLY not with just looks but scratch resistance and smudging too (a huge problem as well with the z3).

The Xperia z3 does have a bigger battery which always helps, the CPU and GPU have never been a big problem with me so whether or not you care about that is up to you, personally i dont see a reason for a over the top CPU since there really aren't many apps that can truly utilize the power (at least from what i see). The camera on the z5 is flat out better, thats all i will say on that topic. most everything else is the same but i will repeat this again because it is awful and you will notice it with the z3 always, the smudging, its awful, like the worst, your fingerprint smudges get everywhere and it is a hassle to always clean it (which happens to lead to micro scratches if you use your shirt).

Sony does have an online presence and I found that there's a huge family of Xperia owners I can interact with. I always root (jailbreak for Apple) my phones for total access/control. Sony actually assists in the process so I can find a stable, trusted custom ROM. \r\nSony plays nice with other phones (transferring data, etc), and works seamlessly with all of my devices. I love Mirror and Throw. \r\nBTW, all 3 Xperias are still running strong! I gave the T to my mom and the ZL to my Goddaughter, and neither are asking for new phones. My apologies but my theory is more is more with regards to technology. \r\nFinally, the simplicity of Xperia's appearance is sophisticated. I also like the less rounded corners of most Xperia models; it sets itself apart from all of the others. Sitting next to other phones of the same \"screen\" size, it's always smallest.

Unlike other smart phones it does not work as a hard drive when it is attached\n \r\nDesign and equipment \n \r\nthis has got to be the most stupid aspect of this phone. The earphones provided are substandard and cheap \r\nThere is no volume control on the ear phones so in order to change the volume of music that you are listening because the volume keys are positioned at the bottom of the phone you have to take your phone out of your pocket to put the volume up or down\n \r\nThe Jack socket to attache the earphones has been positioned on the wrong side of the as when using the phone in a landscape fashion the  volume keys are backwards\n \r\nThese are just some of my views in regards this phone and there are many more. I cant believe that Sony has produced such a rubbish phone as I used to use their Sony Ericsson which were actually very good in some cases and from a merchandising perspective this is the phone that features in the new bond film, bond would have thrown the this phone back at Q and said it it rubbish \n", "date": "13 Jan 2016"}, {"text": "Z5 is.

SONY still needs to do some work to improve the camera and overall build quality in the upcoming Z6. The camera needs to be faster and brighter in the Z6. And the device needs to be more durable. And it needs OIS to be truly competitive. There's more to a camera than pixels. And the build quality needs more metal and a lot less plastic making the entire device much more durable.\n \r\nAlso, SONY needs to stop ignoring and start recognizing the US market. The US is the biggest, most important, and most affluent marketplace on the planet, yet SONY fails repeatedly to recognize this fact and has not released the Z5 in the US. Instead, SONY expects its US customers to buy their $800+ phones from 3rd party re-sellers like eBay or Amazon with no warranty whatsoever. Who would do that? What are you thinking SONY? Furthermore, you need to make your warranty valid globally, not just in the country or location of purchase. Your customer support is abysmal. I don't own anything Apple makes, but Apple is great with customer service. Apple will recognize their warranty on any Apple device anywhere in the world, no matter where you bought it. Apple will provide help, answer questions, give advice, and even repair any Apple device at any Apple location in the world. Take notice of this very very important fact SONY.\n \r\nSONY, you need to advertise your products everywhere and price your phones to sell. Your phones are just simply too expensive for an also-ran device. Lower the price to something more realistic and reasonable if you really want to sell your phones.\n \r\nFinally, SONY, focus on the getting the basics right and forget about all the worthless tricks and gimmicks you incorporate in your phones that add nothing of value for the end-user of the product. For example, you can skip 4K, pressure sensitive touch screens, dinosaurs in the pictures, and Playstation remote feature, which are, frankly, unnecessary and worthless. Give us a better camera, a better warranty, better global support, and more places to go where we can actually see, touch, ask questions, and purchase your phones. At least, make your phones available on your own US website, unlocked.\n \r\nWhat's that you say, SONY? You say you are losing a million dollars a day in your smartphone division? It's not hard to understand why.\n \r\nIf you do these things and get it right, you may have a chance to remain in the race, otherwise, it's almost the end of the line for SONY smartphones. I hope the Z6 is a really great phone because \"good enough\" is no longer good enough to compete in this highly competitive arena.

It brings a vibrancy and sense of depth to colours and a subtly to the gradient of blacks it combines to form deep, engaging shots. \r\nIt excels where most smartphone cameras come unstuck, too - low light photography. Effortlessly balancing areas of light and shade. The phone's focussing is quick and on point - even when the lights have gone down. After dark shots feature minimal noise and light pollution is minimised. Its macro skills are hard to fault too, with the dedicated, physical shutter button and easily tweaked camera controls making capturing the perfect shot a breeze. \r\nThere's a secondary 5.1-megapixel camera that sits up front too. This isn't on the same level as its primary sibling, but is more than capable of taking a decent selfie, even in areas of reduced lighting - an area where many of its rivals struggle. \r\nOverall, however, the camera is the Z5's crowning glory and party piece.

Just running through Geekbench once caused quite an amount of heat, I can only imagine that running it a second time would have caused the results to be considerably lower than even this poor score, I didn't try that however.\n \r\nTwice the Camera app shut down on me due to the heat, by the end of the day I had had enough. I rang Carphone Warehouse to check my return / refund rights, and just making this call alone (which lasted maybe 10 minutes) stated making the phone hot again!!!\n \r\nLuckily Carphone Warehouse have a 14 day return policy, and yesterday I took the device back and got my refund (all \u00a3549.99 as I bought it sim-free).\n \r\nI really wanted to like this phone, and took Sony's word for it that they had sorted the heating issue's highlighted by the Z3+.....well it seems they haven't! \n \r\nMaybe I just got a duff unit, who knows but I doubt it judging by the stories I am starting to see pop up on the internet regarding both the Z5 and Z5C and heating issues.
