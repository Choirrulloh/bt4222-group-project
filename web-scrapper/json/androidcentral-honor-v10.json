I have had Samsung Galaxy note's since Note3 and while always expensive I considered them good value for money for what the can do.,But not anymore in my opinion.\nI have an Honor View 10 arriving today and I paid less the half the price I paid for my Note8. I bought it because I broke my Note4 playing ingress. The reason I used a Note4 for Ingress was to protect my Note8 from accidents. Didn't want to risk my \u20ac1000.00 phone dashing around playing Ingress. So a broke Note4 had me looking for a replacement Ingress phone, so Honor View 10 purchased and is here today\ud83d\ude01\nNow I am thinking if this phone is good I may just sell my Note8 while it's still worth a half decent amount and just use my Honor for all mobile duties. Without worrying about how much it will cost if I damage it.\nSo I will report back in a few days and give you my impression of the Honor View 10 against he Note8.", "time": "03-16-2018 03:40 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6196041", "text": "I am looking for to hearing your opinion. \nI sold my Note 8 and got the Pixel 2 XL and I don't regret it at all.
