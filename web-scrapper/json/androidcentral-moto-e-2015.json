I have found various solutions on-line, but all involve going into developer mode.\n2) I can't get into developer mode. I had done so in Lollipop - now 7 taps - even 17 taps, on Build number just brings up part of an unmovable magnified image of the about phone menu - it certainly doesn't get me into developer mode. Clicking on developer options just shows developer options are not available to this user.\n3) Home and Settings buttons don't work. They light up and vibrate when I tap them but they do nothing. So now, how do I switch quickly between apps - eg to copy from a web site into Keep or copy and paste between documents? And how do I get quickly back into the Home menu without backing out of each individual page? (I use Smart Launcher)\n4) Why has the name of the SD card changed to a 8 digit code? What was wrong with SD card 1?\n5) I seem to have less space in Internal Storage for Apps, and under apps in settings there seems to be no easy way to send apps to the SD card as there used to be. How do you do that?\nI want to reformat my SD card to Internal storage but am loath to do that if I am not going to be able to reload my pictures and music and at the moment I can find no way top get files from my PC to my phone. None of this feels like progress to me and I'm feeling I'd like Lollipop back - first step - enter developer mode - see 2 above!\nHelp!", "time": "04-28-2016 09:11 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5152281", "text": "Hi John\nMe personally, I would do the factory reset and be done with it.

There's a bug affecting a few users after Marshmallow. The soft keys not working is one of the principal symptoms. In most cases is related to the setup wizard.

My new one does indeed have a Gmail account. I don't use that for my email, preferring to stick with Outlook and Hotmail on my laptop. I was hoping Hotmail on my laptop, my phone and Gmail Contacts would all update when I amended anything in my Contacts on any one of them, but when I posted yesterday they all seemed to be doing their own thing - worse, they may have been overwriting one another. Right now, this minute, my phone is behaving, after my husband tweaked something, but I'm still loathe to key in all my tel nos again until I understand how it all works.\nRe the photos, I have Google Photos, which I believe might be instead of Gallery. Working on my laptop or my phone, I can see all my pics in Photos. I can also see them all in Google Drive, which I think may be where they are backed up. However, I can only see 26 photos if I view my phone from my laptop via a USB lead. Where are all the rest?\nI've now got all my photos backing up to Google Drive. Trouble is, I see that Google Photos is a folder within Drive, so I don't know how safe they will be there, because when I delete a pic from my phone it disappears from Photos. Why do I need both Drive and Photos? What's that all about? \nI want to put the photos somewhere safe where I can keep them forever, so that I can delete them from my phone and clear some space. How do other people manage that pls? Is there a way of saving them automatically to my laptop, for instance? I can't seem to manage it using a USB connection. Or do I have to view them in Photos or Drive and somehow copy them across?\nHope all this makes sense.

I have a Moto E that is probably about two years old. It is running Android 5.1.\nI configured the phone to require a PIN whenever I want to use it. I did that because the phone was \"butt dialing' too many people.\nThe problem is, sometimes the phone would turn on in my pocket. Then, it would enter random data as the PIN. If you don't enter the PIN after ten tries, the phone resets, under the assumption someone is trying to break into it.\nFortunately, I have my contacts backed up. The VCF files are stored not only on an 8 GB SD card I installed in the phone, but it's backed up on various media. \nI lost some text threads, but they weren't vital. I lost my home-made ringtones, but fortunately, I had them backed up as well. Had I not backed up the contacts and ringtones, I'd be in serious trouble.\nSo, the obvious question is: Is there a way to prevent the phone from resetting, simply because the phone got turned on accidentally in my pocket?

Plus my wife and in-laws can still get mms on their phones - same exact phones, same exact plan, and yes 100% sure they're all on wifi. And no they are not using any third party apps - we're talking about the messaging app that comes default with the phone. Further more all of my co-workers (at least the ones with data plans) are able to receive mms and group texts among each other without constantly switching off of the work wifi over and over again.\nIn the passed day the issue has become worse. Now I can't even send/receive mms messages with wifi off. (where as before I could at least turn off wifi temporarily to read my texts). I contacted cricket support and went through a gauntlet of attempted fixes to find out that I probably have a bad SIM card that needs to be replaced at my local cricket store. So this whole issue may not fit my original question any longer - meaning my mms may not have been failing to download merely because my wifi was on. \nI'm going to post a reply here tomorrow once I get a chance to visit the cricket store.

I wound up not getting a new SIM card - I would have had to pay for another SIM card to be activated (which I did not expect, since my phone is still under warranty). They told me even if the new SIM card didn't work I couldn't refund the new SIM, so before doing so I decided to do a factory reset as a last ditch effort. The factory reset worked. I was finally able to send/receive mms messages not only with just data on, but also while wifi was on and active as well. \nBut the story doesn't quite end there. I had to set my phone up and download all of my apps again. After downloading all of my apps and updating everything accordingly the same exact problem was back to rear it's ugly face once again. So after deleting a few apps in an effort to find a conflicting app (with no success) I decided to do yet another factory reset. Once again mms messaging worked again as expected. So now I've been in the process of adding one app at a time testing mms each time I add an app.\nI'm not 100% positive but I believe the problem child was the 3rd party messenger app I was using (messenger made by google). I didn't download this app but instead set Hangouts as my default sms sender/receiver. Once I set my sms with Hangouts the same exact problems I had before began to occur. So I set my phone back to it's default messaging app and I was able to send/receive mms just as I had after the factory reset. This strikes me as a little strange because I did a little bit of troubleshooting with my 3rd party messenger very early when I first encountered issues with my messaging.\nFor now I'm going to call that the culprit of my messaging problems, but as I continue to add more of my apps back I'll report back to this thread if need be.

But if I'm going to finally do this and plan to do it once, I want to be able to use it well. I'm planning to use only talk, text, and wifi - no data. But I need GOOD phone quality (as in PHONE quality - making calls, checking messages, you know things that we used to do with phones. speakerphone for driving/multitasking) and intend to use basic productivity apps like email (wifi dependent, obviously), calendar, a few other basic utilities and social media type things. Aaaand... I'll want it to take pictures. I have a real camera and I don't need it to be a full-time camera substitute (that would sure be nice but probably not in my price range) but you know how sometimes your camera is not with you when something awesome happens. I'm a snapshooting mom/teacher and also a lover of art and nature so I often like to just capture something interesting I see on the fly. It doesn't need to be professional quality but it should, yknow, work. And ALL the reviews say the camera is the worst thing about this phone.\nI'm coming from an LG EnV Touch, which has a really good camera for a basic phone (and a decent flash too - again, relatively speaking) Only 3.2 mp but nice color and good enough for catching a moment to share. So I guess my question is would the Moto E be a downgrade from that, or is it just not as good as other current higher-end smartphones? Is it bad compared to anything, or is it just bad if you have high standards? How would you compare it with other phone cameras in the lower-end class - like please don't even waste time telling me that it is awful compared to iPhone and Galaxy S7. Not only is that obvious but it's irrelevant with a $500+/- price difference.\nThanks in advance for your input.

I'm wondering how much better the S5 is than the Moto E? \nAlso do did your mom upgrade the OS in the Moto E to Lollipop before she decommissioned the phone? If so did it still work okay?

I did that after I charged it to 100% straight out of the box. And everything worked except picture messaging!! But I called straight talk and told them I couldn't edit the apn (which sadly you can't) but after they messed around in their system, they had me factory reset with the sim still in the phone, and go through set up. After that everything worked flawlessly! I was going to use the Moto E, after my iPhone 5C shattered on its first drop from waist height in an Otterbox (It seriously upset me) but I really missed Android even after the month and a half I used iOS. So I'm back to my LG Transpyre, (which updated to 5.1.1 btw) but I'll be upgrading to a Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime on AT&T sometime this week. But both the Moto E 2nd Gen & LG Transpyre have been amazing phones for the course of time we used them. And if you can I'd highly recommend the S5. My mom absolutely loves it! The camera, battery life, screen, and storage are just spectacular in her opinion. Only the Straight Talk version of the S5 runs KitKat 4.4.2. And I don't think Straight Talk updates their phones, I've even checked Samsung Kies and it said the S5 was on the latest software. So if you don't mind an slightly outdated Android version then go for the S5. I've also looked around on Walmart's website and I've found a Samsung Galaxy S5 on Verizon with a great price. I'll look for again and put the pictures up, if I find it. I hope this helps, and that I wasn't to confusing.\nUpdate: Seems like the AC App won't let me upload any picture attachments. \nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "11-22-2015 09:30 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4850813", "text": "Very interesting! Walmart BF ad also has the Straight Talk Grand Prime on Verizon Network for $49 which has Lollipop. But seemed like the reviews were just so-so. One reviewer said the LTE speed was slow. Display was washed out. Low pixel count. Maybe the $200+ price tag was a factor in the reviews. Moto E 2nd gen has most of the features of the Grand Prime with slightly smaller screen and no camera flash. Please let me know what you think of the phone if you get one before the Black Friday sale starts. Call quality & battery life are important to me. Moto E is only $10 in the Best Buy BF. So it's like a throw away. I'd probably order 2-3 as backups. \nI don't need to have the S5 but I figured it performed circles around the Grand Prime of Moto E 2nd gen. It's $229 in the walmart BF sale on page 9 \nWith the BOGO deal on refill cards, I bought a stack of refills so I'll be staying on Straight Talk for a while. And I like Verizon coverage.

Hopefully tomorrow or Wednesday my money will come in, so I can finally go to the store and purchase the phone. It even has NFC!

They didn't have a case, but as it turns out I had bought a Moto G (1st edition?) case sometime back, thinking I was going to buy a G (but didn't), and that case fit the E 2015 almost perfectly--so I'll have protection until the case I ordered arrives.\nI'd actually been eyeing higher models, like the G 2015, as I recently owned the Galaxy S5, but I can't decide what I want (Zenfone 2, Moto G 2G RAM model, Moto X Pure when it comes out, Nexus 5 2013, a number of ideas), and I was not really digging the ZTE Maven I was hobbling around on, so I got this to hobble around on while I make up my mind and save up my money; at least I'd have something smooth and decent.\nSo far I like it pretty good. It's smooth and not prone to hard core lag, and continues so with me now having updated to 5.1. There's nothing really to say in detail other than it just works. Most notably, unlike a ZTE Grand X Max + phablet I recently owned, it gets consistent service where I live even if only with 1-2 bars, the S5 also did, so did the ZTE Maven, but that ZTE Grand X Max + had a devil of a time doing anything here. No so with this E.\nOne question I have--I noticed the screen \"wakes up\" if I pick it up, but no matter what I tap or press, I can't get it to go from there, I instead have to press the power button the same as if it hadn't waken up to begin with. What should I be tapping or pressing?\nAlso, 2 apps I have installed for \"timed profiles\" now don't work on this phone as they had on the others.

Either way, I like this, it means you often don't have to press the power button to wake the phone up. \nThe second question--the timed profiles apps I use, on this phone they put the phone in \"priority notifications\" mode, so if you have any alerts (like calls) set to alert you even in silent-vibrate mode, they will. This at first upset me, I thought I'd have to manually put the phone in silent mode using other means and lose an easy means of having timed periods of silence through the apps I've always used.
