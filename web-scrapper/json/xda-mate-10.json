Honestly the 18:9 OLED  1080p screen is super nice regardless of the normal mate 10 having a QHD panel. I'd say it is a very well built screen\n\nQuick. The kirin 970 has been fast and haven't had any glitches or even odd stutters\n\nHaving oreo is great, and MIUI has been pretty swell in my experience. I've seen a lot of hate on it so I was a bit nervous, but honestly it just gives you a lot of different options in the settings I feel like. Personally as someone that likes to tinker with their device but doesnt feel like rooting, I like being able to tweak every aspect of the phone to the extent of the vast number settings.\n\nCons \nReally the only one I can think of currently is software stuff. I hate not being able to expand notifications from the lockscreen and idk why it doesn't let you do that. Idk if it'd an oreo thing or a MIUI thing but I hope it gets fixed in an update because I'd hope that wasn't intentional.\n\nWill add more as I think of them \n\n\nThings I don't have enough credibility to critique :\nCamera.

More testing needs to be done. So far I like there being less artifacts and the more natural feel (although this can be subtle). \n\nIn some conditions - especially when there are clearly defined lines like bold text in the picture, the normal mode can bring out more detail (a shelf full of books from about 2 m distance is such a case). So this might not be an improvement in all scenes. Also the wide aperture mode sometimes struggles with highly textured surfaces with no bigger objects (f.e. my woodchip wallpaper and my carpet - it outright smears the details in parts of the picture, maybe because it has no object to put in the center of the artificial aperture processing).\n\nAn other downside: In lower light with wider aperture mode you lose the automatic improvement of a scene (the one where you are prompted to hold the camera still), which really can make a huge difference.\n\nI am interested, what you find.\n\nEdit: So far I find the difference in bright daylight rather small.
