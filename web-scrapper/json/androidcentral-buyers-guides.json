Older Android phones (ones that came with Android versions up to and sometimes including 4.0) typically break up storage memory into 3 main partitions (i.e., areas):\n1. Application Storage: Where Android installs apps. This can range from as little as 256 MB to 3 GB, depending on the phone. Lower end phones usually have less storage, and therefore can have fewer apps installed at one time. Data that the apps generate and save on the phone may also be saved here, although they might also be saved in one of the 2 other areas below. When you start to approach the Application Storage limit, you start getting insufficient storage warnings. You can free up Application Storage by moving some apps to #2 below, but you can never move the entire app, because some key elements need to remain in Application Storage.\n...\n3. External SD Card: This is the physical microSD card that you can remove. Most of these older phones can handle up to a 32 GB card, which seems like it should greatly expand your phone's capabilities, but the problem is that the external SD card can really only be used to store media files (like photos, videos, and music), and as an ancillary storage area for some apps (but not all).", "time": "02-21-2018 05:17 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6168679", "text": "https://www.howtogeek.com/114667/how...o-the-sd-card/\nAndroid 6.0 Marshmallow lets you \u201cadopt\u201d your SD card as internal storage, automatically installing allowed apps to the SD card.

I used to have an android phone before the 7Plus, but I really enjoyed it. I had a small hiccup with it, but got it resolves and thus when I had the chance, upgraded to iPhoneX. I apologize for the lengthy post but figured I'd write my story here in hopes of informing others should they experience something similar.\nPart 1:\nMy previous iPhone 7 Plus (purchased a year ago) died due to a defective cpu and upon attempting to have it repaired at the local iPhone shop was told that I could not as I did not have the receipt (despite Apple's own website and representatives stating that a receipt is NOT required). Fast forward to 5 weeks ago when I purchased 2 iPhone X's for myself and my wife. My iPhone had an issue with the earpiece sounding like it was blown so I contacted Apple support on my holiday and scheduled a callback for when I returned. \nThey got the number wrong and I had to contact them once again. I was told by the first representative that he felt it was a software issue and that I should just return the phone to the place of purchase, though I explained that I'd purchased this from an online retailer and that this would incur me further costs and time in order to receive support. I was then disconnected. The same day I contacted another person who explained that I could return it to a repair shop to have it repaired, despite my request for an exchange, and that no receipt would be required. I also requested another callback with customer care to have this resolved. \nI then went to my local store which they gave me the address for and was once again told that nothing could be done without a receipt, despite me explaining this was purchased through an online distributor and thus without receipt and that I was told by the Apple reps that receipt would not be required. Once again, I received no callback (though I received an email saying they attempted this, despite me sitting and waiting next to my phone at the scheduled time of 5-5:30pm). \nOnce again, I contacted them again today, and have yet again requested a callback. The return date from my online distributor has now passed and the shop has refused me service twice in the past year despite both online and phone representatives saying I would not have issue. At this point, I just wish for the issue to be resolved by apple directly as soon as possible. Purchasing a $1000 phone, only to have it not work and refused customer service (twice in a single year) is absurd. I do not want to wait an additional 2 weeks (10-15 business days) with a much older phone as a replacement during the period in which they repair a phone which was broken out of box and wish to be contacted by phone to resolve this issue (a number I have given them no less than 6 times now, 4 times in the past week).\nPart 2:\nI was contacted by someone who identified them-self as a representative in Shanghai Executive Relations. Initially, he had told me that all I would need to do is go to the store and explain that this representative had investigated this issue, then this situation would be rectified. He then later said that I would have to look up the initial store's address and then contact him to inform him of the information from the initial encounter, then inform him which store I would be going to BEFORE going to the store, then go to the store, then explain to them the situation, then hopefully receive customer service. \nThroughout the call with Weng Yue Wong, the Apple Shanghai Executive Relations Representative, I asked him whether the initial advice or the latter advice was incorrect. He said neither were incorrect and that all was correct. I asked him how that could be considering the differing advice and steps he'd added throughout the call and he reaffirmed that all the information he provided was correct. \nI asked numerous times what progress had been made on my previous emails and calls and he said he did not have any of this information and did not deal with this sort of information. When I asked what his role is, he expressed that he deals with Government responses. I asked him what could be done to resolve this issue and expressed that I'd already been refused service due to lack of receipt and that I did not wish to spend more money and time travelling without a guarantee that the terms and serviced entered would be honored as per all Apple documentation.\nAfter nearly two hours of dealing with this representative's conflicting information, I requested a supervisor which he explained to me that there were none. He provided me support in Chinese and when I requested English support he refused, and when I requested clarification of this information he then hung up on me, still not providing clear details of which information to follow.\nSince my initial complaint, I have sent an additional 4 emails asking for a resolution to this issue. \nI still have not been contacted by Customer support to resolve this issue, nor have I been contacted by a supervisor as per requested. It has now been 4 weeks since purchase without support and I'm still waiting...\nHopefully I can be contacted by a representative who can provide me clear, concise information that resolves this issue for me without further expenses on my part. I have contacted an attorney and have been advised to retain all receipts for costs incurred by this issue for reimbursement due to the company's refusal of services despite adhering to all terms and services.\nMy advice is NEVER BUY APPLE, especially if you are planning to work, holiday, or reside in Asia...", "time": "12-15-2017 06:42 AM", "replies": []}]}]

Though I am not very well-versed on those specific Samsung products, I'll do my best to help!\nA few thoughts that came to mind upon reading your post:\n- glass backs do mean a bit more fragility, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you shouldn't buy one! My Honor 8 has a glass back and though I'm a little worried about its fate sometimes, it has sustained a couple drops and accidental \"bumps\" into walls (don't ask, haha). And you can very often buy glass back protectors for your phone; much like screen protectors, I suspect.\n- speaking of the Honor 8, that is a great, midrange (so it's more economical in price) phone with great specs. A small phone at 5.2\", 3000 mAh, and dual cameras with nice results for when you want to take the occasional picture. Newegg's website usually has them on for awesome deals around Christmastime - I bought mine December of last year!\n- with regards to the Moto series: if you know you do not like the look or aesthetics of the phone, I do not recommend considering it. You'll be looking at this phone for a couple of years - best to buy something you'll really love!\n- I would go to a store near you that sells both Samsung models that you are considering; and try them out in the store. See what they feel like in the hand, and try and think about which one you'd enjoy looking at/using long-term.\n- with regards to last year's phones, you can certainly find one at a great price and can rest assured about it getting updates for at least another year. Android phones usually get updates for two years after their launch date, from what I understand.\n--> Going off of that, since you are looking for a smaller phone and a solid performer that would last a couple of years, have you considered the original Pixel phone? It's at 5\", 2770 mAh (a little smaller in battery power), and it's stock Android. Plus, it's a Google phone, so it'll be first in line for OS updates!\n--> Also, even if a phone is over its two-year OS updates timeframe, that doesn't mean it will stop performing well. As long as you maintain the phone to the best of your ability and maybe clean up a couple of apps and free some space up here and there, you may be able to get a longer lifespan out of it. I've had friends use phones (Nexus 5, for example) long after software updates were available for them, and they still performed adequately.\nI'm sorry, this turned more into an essay than an answer to your post!

After two eight hour car rides in three days I got the first instance of a bug I've now found is common to the LG model; \"invalid SIM card\". Since the phone already corrupted my SD card a month back I figure that the SIM card slot isn't too long for the world (given that the main solution seems to be keep the phone cool; a cause I gave up on long ago despite giving up phone games). Anyone have a second opinion on this, or am I wise to start planning for the worst?\nPart 2: All of that said... I originally bought the G3 when I was young and foolish, doing no research on the phone before I went in and just buying the non-Apple product that had an SD card slot for the most potential storage. I have since rethought my juvenile 21-year old ways and come up with much better criteria for buying a phone; I want something that doesn't lag (I understand that a web page takes a while to load, but I'm not sitting for 30 seconds between news articles), something with a lot of storage space for music (I don't go for anything that requires me to store it off my phone; my data signal isn't nearly reliable enough), and something that is reliable enough to actually last long than the time it takes to pay off (or at least as close as I can get these days...).\nObviously cost is a concern, but I'm at a point in my life now where I'll pay a little more now to acquire a device that will serve me better long term, and even better if it will actually last longterm. That said, if two options are the same all things considered than I'm not about to splurge for splurging's sake either. In addition, so long as it's an Android I'm not too picky on manufacturer, but after the last burn by LG hardware I'm not too trusting of them at this time.\ntl;dr: I think my phone's dying but the manufacturer and AT&T both claim there's nothing they can do, and I want something that does a better job of phoning and I'm willing to pay a little more to get it.", "time": "12-02-2017 09:55 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6093552", "text": "Part 1 - a new SIM port is a lot cheaper than a new phone.\nPart 2 - \"doesn't lag\".

(Make sure it's backed up, in case the card goes bad - warranties cover the card, not what's on it.) And any phone that can handle a 64GB card can handle about any size card coming out in the next few years.\nAs for lasting long, that depends on whether you mean not breaking down (my 2013 Note 3s are still functioning as well as the day I got them, but there's a lot I can't do on them because technology changes), so if you mean a phone that will be compatible with the technology (and version of Android) we'll have in 4 years, you won't find any.\nI recently tried an LG V20.

It is pretty much shot, and have to basically get a new phone now.\nI had pre-ordered the Pixel 2 XL, but I am not really sold on any of the new flagship phones.\nOn any given day when I go to the Verizon store I might like the Pixel 2 XL one day the V30 other days, and sometimes I gravitate towards the Note 8 since I like the pen despite not using it all that much.\nAll of the current flagships seem to have pretty big flaws in my view:\nNote 8: All glass, Awkward size with the elongated 18.5/9 display, UI seems slower, price ($100)\nPixel 2 XL: No headphone jack, no flash socket, display so so with noticeable blue tint\nV30: All glass, slow updates, terrible selfie camera\nEach of them have a clear strength too:\nNote 8 : Pen, best display\nPixel 2 XL: Core Google experience, updates for 3 years, terrific simple camera, squeeze for assistant (surprisingly useful)\nV30: No real hardware weaknesses, Quad DAC\nSo I sort of go round and round in a loop. There is no clear choice. I think I still lean to the Pixel because of software, blue the display and blue shift are annoying, and no headphone jack\nSo i may eventually choose one of these, and actually already have cases for both the Pixel 2 XL (which I still have on preorder) but really not sure of best flagship. I kinda like them all and dislike them all.\nThe i thought, what if I just delay my big purchase for one more year and get something then. No guarantee the choice will be easier or better\nIf I get a \"one year\" phone would look for it to be like $250 max probably less, with a good sized screen and decent automatic camera.

My Note has been very rugged and the S pen, while rarely used, has been handy on occasion. (I won't honestly miss it too much.)\nWhat's really driving me for quite some time now is to get a phone with front facing speakers. I hate the rear speaker on the Note. HATE. (I never use headphones.) I work in a factory. It's loud, even when I go outside for a smoke break. While on break, I'll check out FB or YouTube, and any videos are very frustrating to watch. My hearing is admittedly shot, but playing around trying to bounce the sound back at me has me frequently holding the phone up to my ear to hear it, and then I of course can't see the video LOL It honestly drives me nuts. In my house, incan set the phone on a table with the kickstand case and the sound will bounce off the table back towards me, and then it's perfectly fine and plenty loud. \nPerfect conditions rarely exist after leaving home however and the speaker, more than almost anything else, drives me crazy.\nSo the big reason for picking the Pixel XL 2 is the speaker placement.\nVery disappointed that the V30 had superior codecs, but only a single speaker.\nEven the Note 8 had a single speaker, but the placement is better on the bottom - but I still don't relish the thought of cupping the bottom of the phone trying to direct sound towards my face.\nAll the publicized problems with the Pixel had me nearly reaching to cancel my pre-order, but the fact they're extending the warranty to at least cover how long I'll be making payments to Verizon, I may just keep the phone if it doesn't have any issues I can't live with out of the box.\nI did see the phone in person at Verizon after I pre-ordered, and liked the build quality and ordered a 'Panda'. \nSpeakers and screen size are my #1 priorities, not willing to go smaller. (Although the new aspect ratio did make me pause. I'm used to my Note 4's size after all after all these years.) Prior phone was a Moto X Dev edition that I loved the user experience on. I've always had Android, and will not get an Apple out of spite LOL The only feature I would have liked to try is wireless charging and I may live to regret not having a replaceable battery. \nI wish someone made a solid phone with all the features I wanted along with a monster battery.

The U11+ will come out in that time and maybe that will be the answer though I doubt it. I am probably still leaning towards the Pixel 2 XL, I actually didn't mind the muted colors. One of their engineers admitted it was factory calibrated wrong. They did not mention that in the official update, but I suspect with a better factory calibration and the software update they are doing that the display will be fine. It is still likely better than the Note 4 display regardless. But I will feel a lot better about the Pixel 2 XL purchase if there is a significant discount at Black Friday like there was on the original Pixels last year.

The screen is somewhat unimpressive with 720p resolution at 5.7\", but it does have a stylus which I've grown accustom to using with my PC (it came with a pen, so slightly more than a stylus). Mostly comparable memory/processor to the ZTE phone(s).Samsung Galaxy S6 (Boost Mobile/Unlocked):\nI've seen people loving this phone, especially since the design was a welcome change to the BandAid-looking S5. The size is welcoming at 5.1\", and the specs are overall good for its age. It doesn't have the latest OS, but will it be seeing updates? Can I root to so it goes to Marshmallow/Nougat/Oreo?

My boyfriend has the SE and he wants to switch to Android; and I tell yah, I am *this* close to showing him the world of Android. \nAnyway, as you've mentioned, Android offers way more customizable options and features than Apple. You can totally change the way your phone looks and functions with just the addition of a new launcher, icon pack, or theme. And some phones can make you have an app drawer or not. The possibilities! I change up my experience every couple of weeks. It's that addicting.\nAnd, since we're on the topic of customization and tweaking things to your own liking, let's talk about all of the options available to you! That's one thing I love about Android: choice. With Apple, you really only have two choices: the smaller one or the bigger one. With Android, you have a big variety! You can choose different brands: LG, Huawei, Samsung, HTC, and Motorola (to name a few); and you can choose them for different reasons! If you want a phone with a great battery, then the Motorola Z Play could be your choice. If you want a phone with a great camera, then the HTC U11 is your guide. And so on! There's a phone out there to match your preferences. That's one of the many things I love about Android.\nAnd price! Apple devices are so expensive, and I hate how you need to buy Apple-specific accessories so they can pair with and work with your Apple phone. With Android, there are the expensive phones; but then there are more affordable choices and options that very often deliver similar specs to those of the expensive (flagship) phones. There's no need to spend top dollar for a stellar experience with Android. I love that.\nAndroid offers so many possibilities and it's always fun to try something new! So if you're interested, hop on over to your nearest store - okay, now I sound like one of those dudes in an infomercial...\nAnyway, phone choices! If I were to recommend a phone for a beginner, I'd want to go for a phone that would introduce you to the Android experience by giving you stock/pure Android: and nowadays, that would be the Google Pixel. Its small version is a good size too, so don't worry about that! It's a solid device that performs well.\nAnother device that I'd recommend is the OnePlus 5. Great (dual) camera, solid battery life, and a good size (5.5\" - not too big and not too small). And it has the latest processor enabled, so it's super fast!\nI also recommend devices from the Motorola brand. They have a good range of phones in different price categories; and last year's phones (the Z Play, for example) offer up great experiences.\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out!

The phone is great, 5.2\", has an awesome dual camera setup, good display, and overall good battery life. Of course, it came out last year, so a 3000 mAh and not the latest processor on the market are two things I'd mention right off the bat; but not having the latest processor doesn't necessarily mean the phone will slow down and lag right off the bat. You can always disable and delete things like bloatware and do a factory reset (back up your data!) to give the phone a little clean-out every now and then. I've been using my Honor 8 since December 2016 and it has not slowed down. Sure, I get the odd glitch or two; but battery and overall performance are great. Also, the phone is gorgeous. It comes in white, blue, rose gold, and black.\nOkay, back to other phones. This next phone is above the $500 price range; but it's a great device that I think will meet your needs better. The OnePlus 5 is a great option! It just came out, so it's still expensive - around $650-$700. However, it has the latest processor and a really good camera; and 3300 mAh battery life. I've heard really excellent things about it. You could always wait for the next sale or for Christmas deals; but if you want to get your phone sooner rather than later, I understand that that may not be an option.\nYes, the Google Pixel would also be a great choice. I always recommend stock Android/Google experiences! The Pixel itself would be at a better price point soon-ish, since the next Google Pixel iteration is set to drop soon... In October, I think?

Thing is, I've lost touch with the phone market, hence this thread. I would say I'm an average user.

Terrible device, it's what made me switch to Windows Phone. Bad build quality and buggy software. Has LG improved since then?\nFor alternatives, the Motorola Moto Z Play 2nd gen. also caught my eye. This one does tick all the boxes on my wish list, but it's not available at my carrier yet, so I'm not sure about the price, though it should be within my budget.\nThe upcoming Nokia 8 also seems interesting. I'm just concerned it will be outside my budget.\nLastly, there's the Samsung Galaxy S8. I'm including this one simply because EVERYONE is recommending it. Personally, I'm a bit torn.

I'm looking for a tablet. Been eyeing two: Asus Zenpad 3S 10, version z500m and nVidia Shield K1.\nFirst of all, I have a budget of 370 euros ca.\nSo, I'm undecided. Stock android would be a plus, a notification LED as well, SD card is a welcome bonus. I'll use it for media consumption (TV shows, maybe movies, books, comic books and music), some games, and web browsing.\nI'm not interesed in the LTE versions, WiFi is good enough. If I want networks outside, I could always tether it to my phone like I did with my old tablet.\nAs I've said, stock android, notification led and SD card would all be welcome bonuses.\nAs of now, I've been eyeing two models none of which have stock android as far as I know, nor a notification LED.\nFirst is Asus Zenpad 3S 10 (the z500M version), second is nvidia shield K1.\nAsus Zenpad seems like it has a mediatek cpu, which is one of my main concerns, as I don't know if they are worse than qualcomm CPUs or if they perform better. Also, it's Hexa-core (2x2.1 GHz & 4x1.7 GHz), which means that apps might not be optimized to make the most out of it.\nNvidia Shield K1 has Quad-core 2.2 GHz Cortex-A15, gsmarena reports also the GPU which it says it's a ULP GeForce Kepler (192 cores)\nMore problems I can find with both of them is that they both have a sub-300 pixel density (264 for Zenpad, 283 for Shield K1).\nI am used to the 2013 Nexus 7 which had 323. I don't know if the difference would be very noticeable or not, especially because maybe the increased resolution helps.\nLastly, I was wondering if, since they both got Nougat, they can both use multiwindow. I think it might be kind of useful with the bigger screens.\nI, of course, welcome any suggestion about any other tablet not listed above. I'm not sure about screensize. Part of me is interested in trying something bigger than my old Nexus 7, but having never tried a bigger tablet I'm unsure about the comfort of it. I'm also not fully sure about 4:3, but I usually am able to adapt to black bars.\nThanks! \nAddendum: I've been considering the lenovo yoga tab 3 plus, even though it lacks nougat.

But this time I have no idea at all.\nRight now I've got a LG G4 that I got in October of 2015. It's been a pretty decent phone up until the last 6 months or so. But now it's starting to give some me some concern if it's going to lay down or not. It's had a problem with freezing up when trying to either turn on or turn off bluetooth. When on a charge the screen will flash from the wallpaper to a solid black screen and it will keep doing that until I can power it off and restart it. Or the battery will drain away very fast and I'm a very light phone user. That's what it did today. It cam off of the charger at about midnight last night and it's about 4pm here now and it's down to 14% left. That was the last straw. Since I only had about $40-$50 left to pay it off I went ahead and paid it off. I've had enough. I just don't trust it anymore. \nThe 3 choices I've narrowed it down to are Pixel, LG G6, and the S8. I'm with Verizon and I went down to the Verizon store a few weeks ago to see and touch all of them for the first time hoping that it would clear everything up. It didn't.\nHere is what I'm looking for in a phone. Even though I'm a light phone user I don't think my battery level should drop below 50% by the time I come home from work in the evenings so I would like it to have a good battery life. I don't take that many pictures but I do take a fair amount in low light (concerts, etc.) and I do the occasional video so I would like a good camera. I don't care anything about wireless charging or waterproofing. If the best phone has that then fine, if not fine. I don't care anything about removable battery or if it has a glass back.\nHere's what I've read about each one and it may or may not be true. Pixel - decent camera, not that good of a battery life, gets updates quicker than any other phone. G6 - better camera, fairly good battery life, kind of plain jane graphics. S8 - best camera, fairly good battery life, beautiful screen, more storage space.\nWhen I looked at all of them it was hard trying to wrap my head around this new tall aspect ratio of the S8 and G6. Putting them against my G4 it looked like they took up about the same total space as the G4 but the screens don't look any bigger. Protecting the S8 looks like it would be a challenge because of the wrap around screen. It does look nicer I guess than the other two.\nSo that's my dilemma. Having spent about 20 minutes fooling around with all of them, none of them really stood out from the other. I did rule out the Pixel XL and the S8+. They just look too long and it's not worth the extra money for them.\nSuggestions? Experiences with all 3 of them?

But I was slightly tilted towards the G6 after that hands on and now having heard what you said and reading the head to head comparison, I think the G6 is what I'm going to go with.

I've owned an original Droid, Droid 3, and Droid 4, and currently use a Galaxy S5, all with Verizon. I'm really stumped on what to get as my next phone as more often than not, I find a phone that appears to have root and the features I want (LG V20 or the Galaxy J3 V were two I've looked at), but it's for a special unlocked edition, only in certain market models, or ones that have since had root exploits plugged. I'm currently in the market because I'd rather do a planned replacement and my current Galaxy S5 is 3 years old and has obvious screen burn from the black info bar.\nWith more recent Android updates, I know that the default OS state will block file copying, which is a deal breaker for me. Using Titanium Backup is also very useful to me for rollback/migration of apps & settings. Because MTP craps out when copying a large amount of files or single files that are large, I prefer to use file explorers that can use UNC paths, which allow me to copy files easily without issue and more quickly. Due to storage concerns, I'd really rather have the ability to self-replace the memory card. I'd also like to make sure that I can decrypt the SD card for data access in an SD reader inserted in my PC.\nI've been looking at phones with SD and removable batteries. Based on experiences with Droid 4, I would rather have a removable battery, but I can deal if there's not an option. Sometimes popping the battery out was the only fix when it got stuck or in the case of the Galaxy S5, after 3 years I am now on my third battery, after the first went all \"puffy\" and it was far more convenient to replace the battery than the phone. Though, I will say, when the Droid 4 battery went all puffy after being relegated to a test/dev device, I was able to easily replace the battery, I just needed a teeny-tiny torx driver... so much for not being user serviceable.\nI'm not above switching carriers (like getting a universal unlocked phone and go GSM with ATT) provided I'd still get a decent amount of GB per month and can do a wifi hotspot without an extra (or minimal) surcharge and there's good coverage in the Nashville, TN area (*NOT* TMobile - my corporate phone is on their network and I can't use it except at work or in one place at home unless I connect to WiFi). \nSo looking for recommendations/experiences with rootable phones that can give me the experience I'm looking for.", "time": "06-16-2017 05:09 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "What should succeed a Nexus 5X...", "thread": [{"postID": "post5851197", "text": "Hi all, my Nexus 5X has finally succumbed to bootlooping temptation, so it's new phone time (LG are trying to repair it, so I'll sell whatever comes back from them).\nAll-day battery life is pretty important to me, as is size; I have big-ish hands but not sure I want a phablet as I'd find it a bit difficult to use quickly or sneakily (e.g. at work).\nCurrent contenders in my head are the S8, G6, Pixel (wildcard) or the LG V20 (wildcard, phablet, problems, can't help wanting it :/).\nI am not a huge fan of the curved screen on the S8.

My last use of Android as a daily driver is a Sony Ericsson Xperia X10, so it's been a while since I had a good feel for Android, though did spend a few days using a Nexus 5X - unfortunately as a daily driver it won't work due to only having 16GB storage.\nI'm British but planning a permanent move to the US, so a phone that works properly in both regions is essential, not optional. I need support for the following LTE bands:\n2,3,4,5,7,12,17,20,28,30.I have a US sim on H20 Wireless, an MVNO using AT&T, which at $30 covers my needs with free calling to the UK (data allowance isn't big but 3GB is more than viable).My primary SIM is on Three, but may switch back to GiffGaff, which is an O2 MVNO.I also travel semi-regularly to Europe and support for Australian networks would also be helpful.\nThe above covers everything I might need and my Lumia 950 supports the lot. Looks like most newer phones also support all of the above. Network speed doesn't really matter as the speeds modern chips support are simply not likely in real world use for a very long time...\nWhat I'm after:\n1) A phone that supports the above LTE networks, preferably dual SIM but not essential\n2) Either 128GB storage or the option to use an SD card - ideally a separate slot like in my Lumia Dual Sim but am not totally against having to maintain 2 phones\n3) Reasonable performance - Qualcomm 650 or 8xx would work\n4) Screen size of 4.6 - 5.2\"\n5) Dedicated hardware camera shutter button and a decent camera.\n6) Fingerprint or iris scanner\n7) Price of \u00a3400 or less (the 950 set me back \u00a3350ish, not happy spending more off contract)\n8) Unlocked - not interested in buying a contract and if single sim must be unlocked so that I can swap UK/US SIMs as needed\n9) USB-C just makes life so much easier so is definitely preferred (and rules out the new Nokia's). USB 3.0/3,1 preferred but can stick with USB 2.0. QI charging would also be great as I have plenty of chargers for my Lumia collection, however I could get by without it.\n10) Android - W10M has unfortunately become just too unstable with the creators update on my Lumia 950. I also have iOS covered with a cheap iPod touch and while I like it, the UI is just not flexible enough for me.\nI've been taking a serious look at the Sony XZs and X compact which come in on budget and would fit in with all of the above except having to either choose a Dual Sim US model, or a single sim UK model with fingerprint sensor and no QI charging.

If you are looking at the OnePlus I assume you are on a GSM carrier of some kind? If that's the case, here are some of my favorite picks (and i've owned and used these for extended periods)!\n1. Moto Z Play- it does a ton of things right especially the battery life. I was able to get over 8 hours screen on time consistently. This is unheard of for Android! However, the camera was a big weak point for me. If a camera is really important to you i'd look elsewhere. But, if you really care about battery- look no further.\n2. Honor 8 - you can usually find on good sale for $299.99 which is an insane value. The biggest reason I think this gets passed on is Huawei hasn't made a huge splash in the US yet, plus the processor used is not something we particularly hear about (kirin 950). However, don't let it fool you just because it doesn't say snapdragon! This baby flies! This device for me was real rounded in all areas. If you can get at $299.99 I think its a top pick, but it normally retails around $399. This won't get a ton of software updates down the line most likely. If that's a concern for you about having the latest version of android/security patches i'd pass.\n3. Nexus 6p- don't let a devices age fool you. I think we have become accustomed to only thinking the latest and greatest are the best devices out there. If someone handed me a 6p right now i'd gladly use it as my daily driver. It still has very decent specs especially running stock Android, a great screen, a good camera, good battery life, solid performance, etc... You will also receive security patches and updates at a top tier rate. You can find plenty of these in mint/like new condition on Swappa for your price range!\nHonorable mention- Moto G 5 Plus- like a z play but cheaper. The 4GB ram model will run you $299 while using the same Snapdragon processor.

I'm just an everyday mobile device enthusiast and regular guy trying to save a buck in the world. In pursuit of this endeavor, I decided to give Mint Sim a whirl, because why not? C\u2019mon, what can possibly go wrong with 3 months of 2GB of service for $35 (really it\u2019s $43\u2019ish because of tax and shipping), but seriously, I carry two phones with me every day and I thought it would be a great idea to try a cheap solution and see if really lives up to the hype. Also, I know lots of Mobile Nations users that carry two phones around with them, because hey\u2026 we love our technology, right? Without further ado, let the review begin.Attachment 255974Reality Testing \u2013 Is the service provided as advertised?\nWell, the first thing you need to know is that it\u2019s pre-paid, so you have to pay for all of it up front. Since this is just a personal experiment, I opted for the 3-month plan because it\u2019s the cheapest (I also have tethering with my other phone, as a backup). Another important thing is that you only get the discounted rate if you pre-pay for 3, 6, or 12 months (5GB is $16.67, and 10GB is $20 per month), otherwise $11.67 becomes $23, for 1-month increments (5GB is $33, and 10GB is 39.67). After taxes and shipping, the actual cost for 3-months came out to about $43 USD, and arrived within two days. Important to note --- I didn\u2019t port my number over, but it\u2019s possible for you to port your number; however, you get no additional cost savings for this. Also, bear in mind that this offer is only for new customers \u2013 shall we say \u201cnewly Minted customers?\u201dAttachment 255975Setting Up Service \u2013 How hard can it be?\nActually, it\u2019s pretty darn easy. The SIM-kit was issued a tracking number and arrived in about two days, but you can pay more for expedited shipping. The SIM-kit arrived much like any other carrier provider\u2019s would, in a card-like contraption that can be punched out for smaller sizes, so it can be used as a full-SIM, Micro, or Nano-SIM. I turned my device off, pulled out the old SIM card and popped the Mint Sim, SIM card into my phone and powered it back up. On another note, the SIM-kit does come with a little pamphlet of impressively small proportions and details how to install the SIM and setup service. Before the service will work though, you have to activate the SIM card \u2013 this is also in the little pamphlet. It only takes a few minutes. All you have to do is go to the Mint SIM homepage and up at the top there is an option for \u201cActivate.\u201d Click on the activation link and follow the few short steps, which includes inputting the activation code from the SIM-kit card. After a few minutes of working your way through the activation process, you\u2019ll be in business and can power up your device and connect to the network. I was actually pleasantly surprised at the ease of activating the SIM and establishing service! Additionally, you may have to adjust your phones APN settings, but the mini-pamphlet has all the information you need to do this for either an Android or Apple device.Attachment 255976Performance Test \u2013 Where expectation meets reality.\nAlright, so how is the service working? Well, after a week of using the service I can tell you that it\u2019s definitely not always \u201cblazing\u201d fast, as noted by Mint SIM, but it can be\u2026 and it is adequate. If you aren\u2019t familiar with Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) work, Mint Sim piggy-backs off of the T-Mobile network \u2013 minus the ability for roaming\u2026 not supported by Mint Sim. Also, based on my understanding, Mint Sim users are naturally deprioritized, meaning in congested areas your bandwidth will be much more limited at times, which I attribute to the slower speeds that I received. However, is that necessarily bad? Well, the answer is that it depends. First, objectively, I just paid roughly $12 bucks for 2GB of LTE data, but of course it\u2019s unlimited on 2G after that \u2013 If you don\u2019t know what a 56k modem sounds like, head to YouTube. Reflecting on my experience with Mint Sim so far, I have been able to achieve download speeds of up to 21.04mbps and 12.24mbps, with a top-end 13.79mbps and 9.99mbps upload speeds (this was at 10pm, and 10am, in my suburban home) \u2013 in a side-by-side comparison with my actual T-Mobile phone, I pulled 19.84mbps download, and 10.01mbps upload. Out and about during the day my speeds have sometimes been lower. At 9am in a suburban area, I managed a much less impressive 0.36mbps download, and 1.87mbps upload, whereas with my actual T-Mobile phone I was running a 21.16mbps download, and 4.82mbps upload. But, then again, just one hour later at 10am, I managed 21.04mbps download and 9.99mbps upload speeds with Mint Sim. I have experienced similarly unimpressive speeds at other remote times and didn\u2019t think to screenshot it, but the potential for speed is exists.Attachment 255978Attachment 255979Attachment 255977Fairweather Internet - How does this impact phone performance?\nHaving coped with the lower internet speeds at times, I can say that it hasn\u2019t tremendously impacted my Boom Beach connectivity, or casual browsing, or using Android Central. However, YouTube streaming and other various services are going to be disappointing at these kinds of speeds, so prepare for buffering and low-res video at times. Additionally, on several occasions I have had to turn my network antenna off and back on because of internet \u201cfreezing\u201d, meaning that data transmission stopped working \u2013 curiously, after either of these are done, the internet speed becomes much more responsive for a few minutes. On a positive note, phone calling and text messaging have appeared to be unaffected. I have actually been pleasantly surprised with the call quality and the responsiveness for messaging (no holding patterns or failure to send messages), but that needs to be balanced with connectivity and speed variances. Conclusion \u2013 Is it worth it? \nWell, again the answer is maybe. If you carry two phones around like me and can turn on wireless tethering with the other device, it really makes up for the shortfalls. If you\u2019re cool with occasional inconsistencies in data speeds, then it\u2019s also less worrisome. Call quality and messaging are more than adequate, so if you really need a cheap phone plan with the promise of internet in uncongested areas and off-peak times, this could be the answer for you. I live outside the Houston area, which if any of you are familiar with southeast Texas, you\u2019ll know that the greater Houston area is massive. I have not been able to test the network in the inner-city, which is where the best speeds and network coverage should be at. However, in the well-equipped suburbs with good T-Mobile coverage, Mint Sim doesn\u2019t always keep up. The service is adequate, but with a few asterisk here and there. Does it have enough positives to make it a viable option? I think so. If you need cost-effective communication, it\u2019s a great deal. Of course, this has been my personal experience and Your Mileage May Vary (YMMV) \u2013 So many acronyms\u2026 , so make any decisions with your best interests in mind!\n\"Does it have enough positives to make it a viable option? I think so.\"Pros:\n-\tIt\u2019s cheap and easy to setup\n-\tSometimes it\u2019s nice and fast\n-\tPhone calls and texting are reliable\n-\tInternet is manageable when it works properlyCons:\n-\tNot always \u201cblazing fast\u201d\n-\tConnectivity issues are frustrating, especially when the side-by-side comparison with an actual T-Mobile service is more reliable.\n-\tThe discounted prices are only available for first time customers, so once the initial prepayment period lapses, prices will increase.\nIf you have experience with Mint SIM, or generally have any questions or want to comment, feel free to hit me up, or head over to the comments section. \nIf you\u2019re interested, please check out Mint Sim, at http://www.mintsim.com/?utm_source=v...cUvbUpU5747523", "time": "04-05-2017 07:00 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Looking for: 5\", SD820, 4000mAh battery.

I am having some trouble deciding which phone to get though even after some pretty thick digging. \nFirst of all my main reasons for switching are the customization options and easier access to developer options. I haven't really been into mobile app development, but it is something I want to leave open for the future. Developing for both would be ideal, but I believe that Android would be a better platform for messing around and testing things for me. I also want a larger screen (the 5c has a 4 inch screen) so I can actually see videos and browse the internet without burying my face into my phone. I am looking for a high end phone that will last a little while (price does not matter). That being said these are the phones I have been looking at:\nGoogle Pixel/Google Pixel XL:\nThe XL would be the most likely phone I would get. It seems to get good reviews, has a great camera, and performs very well speed wise. I've read that it will receive updates first (of course) \nwhich is something that is useful for developers and uses at least mostly vanilla android depending where you get it. Unfortunately I have heard that many users have speaker and battery drain issues. This would be a huge issue if I am going to spend close to $1000 on a phone. I also read that they are fairly fragile and have minimal water resistance. The water resistance shouldn't be a problem (even though I dropped my Iphone in the toilet once), but the phone needs to be able to take a little bumping around because of my job if it's in my pocket. I will have a case for it. \nLG V20:\nAnother high performing phone spec wise with a great camera. I like the design of the Pixel phone better though. The updates also are not as fast obviously. It also appears to have an LG skin for the interface. I've also heard that the LG phones have GPS issues which could be a problem. Still it is the only other phone currently out that interests me outside of the Galaxy S7 and the S8 is getting closer to its release date. \nThat means either picking up one of those two phones now or waiting for these:\nGalaxy S8: \nMost popular series, has a pretty nice design and will have the new Snapdragon 835. The downsides are that I have heard Samsung is very slow with updates and is pretty far from being vanilla (that may not be too much of a problem but not really sure). Also not sure if I want a curved screen. \nLG G6:\nSeems like a pretty good phone that would be an upgrade over the V20, but not sure what the price point would be compared to the V20 either and whether it would be worth it or not. \nNew HTC Phone(Ocean/11): \nI really don't know a lot about it, but from rumored leaks, it seems like it could be a pretty good phone. Though a lot is unknown. \nSo the question is should I wait for one of these new phones to come out (as the S8 and HTC phone still don't have any real official info out on them yet and the G6 isn't available until next month in the U.S.) or should I get a Pixel or V20 hoping that I don't run into the problems some of the other users have had over the course of their existence?", "time": "03-12-2017 10:59 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5721095", "text": "Accessing to developer option or simply develop your own app.\nAnything you can use tho, but if you a developer, you may want to take a look at Pixel because of the update, app should be adapted to new version of OS tho.\nYou can use case to protect the device if you scare it will brake.", "time": "03-22-2017 09:41 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5724858", "text": "All right, thank you.

I am reviewing the iPhone 7 Zerolemon 3100mAhSlim Juicer Charging Case. Product link: ZeroLemon \u00bb iPhone 7 Battery Case, ZeroLemon 3100mAh Slim Juicer Portable Charger iPhone 7 Charging Case-Black This case works ONLY for the iPhone 7, NOT the 7 Plus (although Zerolemon does make a case for the 7 Plus). It not only offers additional protection, but it will also give your phone over 1 full charge (and then some) off of the case\u2019s external battery. This more than doubles your phone\u2019s battery life, allowing lighter users to go 2+ days without needing a charge, and heavy users to go over a full day with the phone surviving everything you throw at it (music, texting, navigation, YouTube, full brightness, productivity apps, gaming, etc.) This case charged my iPhone 7 from 20% to full in right around an hour, so it does offer fast charging speeds as well. The case has a button on the back that charges the phone. When you want to stop charging the phone, you press the button and it stops the charging. It also has 4 LED lights to indicate the charge level of the case. To charge the case, simply leave it plugged into the phone and plug a cable into the case. It directs the power to the phone first, then once the phone is charged the case starts charging. The only slight downside is that the case uses a MicroUSB input to charge, rather than Lightning. This could be a slight issue for Apple users that have several Lightning cables, but good MicroUSB cables are inexpensive. In addition, it does add some bulk to your phone. However, I have grown quite accustomed to it and now I feel weird if I hold a phone that DOESN\u2019T have a battery case on it. For most people (including myself), the benefit of extra-long battery life far outweighs the added bulk. \nTaking everything into consideration, I absolutely 100% recommend this smartphone to anyone looking to keep their phone alive a little longer each day, or needing to go an extended period of time away from a charger.

I'm getting ready to replace my original Droid Turbo, and a couple days of research suggests I'd probably like the Moto Z line or the smaller Google Pixel best, but I'm having trouble making a decision.\nMy first instinct is to go for the Moto Z Play, since it's so much cheaper than the others - I'm in the US, on Verizon, and their website currently has it for $10 a month on their new payment plan thing, which works out to $240, which is a pretty damn good deal - and the battery life is apparently killer. The specs all sound pretty decent, not top of the line, but close enough for the price, and definitely an upgrade from my year old Turbo (which I'm only ditching because there's a loose connection in the speaker and I have to keep a binder clip on it to make sound and that's getting annoying). Buuut, it's a really large phone, and I have pretty small hands - the Turbo is generally a two-handed phone for me and the Zs I held are even wider (and feel disproportionately moreso), so that's a drawback.\nThe Google Pixel (not XL) is very tempting because it's smaller and felt great in my hand, and obviously the processing power and camera and Google-direct software are fantastic but I'm concerned about the battery life and lack of expandable storage - judging by how often I'm deleting things to make space currently with 32gb to work with (well, 23 after the os, which I believe would stay similar) that wouldn't cut it, so I'd pretty much have to go for the 128gb version, but adding another $100 on top of the already rather high price just seems like a lot, and still doesn't help with the battery life if that's lacking.\nSooo... thoughts? Does anyone have experience with both?\nWould the battery life on the Pixel seem disappointing after the Droid Turbo? Am I going to notice the lower processing power on the Z Play if I don't have anything to compare it to? (Assume a fair amount of web browsing and social apps, lots of Netflix/streaming tv, and some puzzle/card games, occasionally more graphically intensive ones.) Is the Pixel worth the extra money or is the Play worth the extra width? If the battery life and fixed storage make the Pixel not worth it but the Moto Z Play isn't enough, is the Moto Z Force the answer? Or is there another phone I'm overlooking that is the perfect balance of power and battery life and size and price?

While the Moto Z Play would end up costing only $240, the actual DPP amount is $408. You're getting a $7 credit on your monthly bill. If anything were to happen where you would want or need to use DPP again to by a phone with less up front cost, you'd have to pay off the full amount, not the discounted amount. (Example: 3 months in you really want to by an S8 on DPP, you'd owe $357)\nI have the Moto Z Force Droid (which is similar in size to the Moto Z Play Droid) while my wife uses a Pixel (not XL) as her main phone.

Google Photos and it's unlimited backup feature manages this for us. \nMy wife gets a day's use out of the battery on the Pixel. The Moto Z Play Droid is a battery beast.

My friend has the Play and is a hqrdcore gamer and so the battery, audio, and display of that phone are important!

It's only for new lines, but they don't say that anywhere actually visible, only if you hover over the right question mark on the detail page. Oh well.)\nWe've now opened up another can of worms, possibly switching from Verizon to T-Mobile to lower the monthly plan costs, which would also happen to save my mom about $100 on her phone outright (\"Carrier Freedom\" paying off her dpp on Verizon if she trades it in to them, and then buying the same model from them for a nice chunk less, even factoring in what she's already paid verizon she comes out ahead), and if I do get the Pixel and we switch soon enough, they're offering bill credits from bringing one in!\nSo if that happens, I'm leaning towards the Pixel. I'd have to pay for it up front, which would be a challenge, but would save me a good bit in the long run, so I could possibly justify going up to the 128gb and eventually buying a mophie-type battery case if I need it.

I have 2 phones and can't decide what to keep. A little background info on how I ended up in this situation. \nI had a Nexus 6P 64 Gig that I got new but not from a retailer. It was a prize to someone direct from Huawei Canada that gave it to me. When I acquired the phone Huawei USA said I could get 1 year warranty from July last year when the phone was awarded for one year provided I sent them the proof it was a prize. I did and they confirmed warranty for a year. Fast forward to this past January when the phone just shut off and wouldn't turn back on. I contacted Huawei and jumped through all the hoops to.get warranty including pay for shipping to.the service center here in Canada. As it turns out the main board was bad and then Huawei said they weren't going to cover it under warranty because it wasn't a retail purchase on-site of being told that they would and I had proof they said that in records found by Huawei USA staff. So after a couple of weeks with out a phone I broke down and bought a Samsung Galaxy S7. I decided to push Huawei one more time and Contacted Huawei Canada. They finally agreed to fix the phone under warranty so now I have two great phones however the Huawei only has a 90 warranty and the Samsung now has 11 months warranty. Both phones have pluses and minuses. \nI don't want to be stuck with a phone issues I have to.pay for again if I have run out of warranty. The Nexus is reaching end of life in September 2017 and who.knows about the Samsung S7. The S7 only has Andriod 6.01 and the 6P Already has 7.1.1. I have no idea if the Samsung will ever get to that release with how slow updates come from Samsung and Roger's Canada. \nTotally don't know what is the better choice. I do like the thought of customizing the phone when it is out of warranty with rooting or ROMS.

I listen to lots of music, brows the web regularly, use Facebook and other social media sights very frequently, and enjoy being able to take nice solid photos as well. \nI went to Verizon the other night and ended up with a Google Pixel. The smaller one in 32GB. It's been a solid phone for the few days I've had it, but there are a few things that bother me about it. The fist is no expandable memory and only 32gb. My iPhone was 256gb. The second is the screen size and resolution. Coming from a 7 plus, I'm used to a slightly larger screen. As for the resolution, I can only really tell a difference when watching Netflix or Hulu. Regular internet videos look fine on YouTube and such. Sometimes at certain angles, some colors can look sort of faded too, but that's minimal. I think if I could find the XL in 128gb that might be the best option for me, but they are back ordered until April right now. So, the search continues. \nLooking for some advice. Do I return the Pixel for another phone with a larger screen and expandable memory? I like the GS7E, but I know the GS8 is right around the corner. The Moto Z looks cool too especially with all the add-ons and mods, but I know updates can run slow for Moto at times. Also, the V20 looks promising, but still felt cheap and plastic like when I tried it out. \nSo what do you all think? Stick with the Pixel?

Now I'm looking to get a smartphone, and I've done some research on what to get, but I'm still a bit confused on a few things, so I came here to as a few questions regarding mobile phones and their performance.\nTo start off, I'm looking for an Android smartphone with good performance (whatever that means haha) which can also be used to play games every now and then. I'm not a hardcore gamer or anything but I like to play games when I'm bored. I'm also looking for something that will last for next few years, like 5-6 years at least, since I'm not the kind of guy who's gonna be getting a new phone all the time. And something that runs apps and games smoothly.\nRight now, I'm looking at the Xiaomi Mi Max 3GBRAM/32GB, which has excellent overall specs and reviews alike. However, I've been looking at some Antutu benchmark tests, and have discovered that another Xiaomi mobile, specifically the XIAOMI REDMI NOTE 3 PRO DUAL 16GB phone with seemingly *weaker* specs overall (and 25% lower price) actually has better performance and is ranked higher than the Mi Max despite lower specs. So I got a few questions here.\nMy first question is, how relevant are Antutu benchmark tests, and how come a phone with weaker specs has better performance than one with better stated specs?\nMy second question is whether or not these tests are relevant to using apps and playing games? Does better performance on Antutu tests mean an overall smoother user experience, whether playing games or using apps?\nMy third question is - what does smartphone performance depend on exactly? If a phone with lower specs can perform better than one with seemingly higher end specs, than how do you measure performance exactly?\nOk, phew, I guess I'm starting to bore you already. I'm basically looking at these 2 mobile phones right now. The Mi Max 32GB costs around 280 USD, and the XIAOMI REDMI NOTE 3 PRO DUAL 16GB costs around 210 USD, basically a quarter cheaper, but with better performance than the Mi Max?\nAlso to note, I do not live in the USA, I live in Croatia, but prices are pretty much the same, more or less. One more thing - if anyone can give me a recommendation on what other phones to buy in the 250 USD range that are better than the Xiaomi phones mentioned above, then please do suggest  As a new user, I'm not that knowledgeable, so a few good recommendations would help a lot. I love the fact that the Mi Max has a 4850 mAh battery and very long life, and I'd like my phone to be durable in terms of battery power.\nAnyway, I think I talk (type) too much. Probably already starting to bore you, too.

In this time, my wife has gone through a Nexus 7 2012, Samsung Tab S and now Samsung Tab S2 8.0. I have been holding out to find a good replacement.\nWhat I am looking for is something that is a little future proof. I know the Nexus 7 only had 1GB of RAM and that worked with Android 4, but in 6, it consumed the majority of it leaving nothing for apps. Most tablets I see today only carry 2 or 3GB or RAM which in 4 years doesn't seem like that large of an upgrade and I thought that was one of the main reasons for going 64bit was to be able to access > 4GB of RAM. So I am worried in 3 years, Android 8 will consume 2GB of RAM and will be back in the same boat. So something with a good chunk of RAM would be advisable.\nAlso with the processor, pretty much any of the 64-bit SoC processors out there like the NVIDIA X1 or Snapdragon 85x series would be a good place and would be good going forward, that isn't the main bottleneck.\nFinally Storage, the MicroSD card would be nice to have since I would like to watch movies play games.\nI do a lot of Travel for work and enjoyed using the Nexus 7 while it worked on the plane for a quick video or game or something I didn't feel like getting the laptop out for. I really don't want to deal with iOS, and everyone I talk to tells me to get a Surface Pro instead but not sure I want to go that route, would rather stick to Android since it is faster.\nI know there is the Pixel C which is the high-end, but it is not expandable with MicroSD and only has 3GB of RAM which I am not sure will be good in a few years, and the cost is almost that of a Surface Pro 3 once the keyboard is factored in, and the fact that Google now only seems to support their newer tablets for a couple years is a little disheartening, the Nexus 9 is already End of Life.\nThe Shield Tablet K1 was another option, but it is only 32bit, only has 2GB of RAM and seems to have been discontinued with no upgrade in sight, so it is a dead-end.\nFinally there is the Tab S2 which is what my wife has, although from what I read there are 2 revisions of this as well with the newer one getting a new processor, I think she has the 1st revision, but she just got Marshmallow and probably slim chance of it getting Nougat officially.\nSorry for the long post, but can anyone shed some light on some options that will be supported for a few years and has a good set of specs to last as well?\nThanks.", "time": "11-16-2016 12:17 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5568832", "text": "Wish I knew.

Eventually, we'll have sub-forums for all of the various categories, but for now feel free to post something, to make suggestions, and to offer your own choices for the best phones in various categories. We promise to read each one, and to take them into account, though we can't promise they'll change our minds.\nHere's why: We've been working overtime to find the right phones for each category, and feel that, as of today, we have the best and most accurate representation of the vast Android ecosystem.
