The phones that are the same in specs or price? It was released as an answer to the s8 but has a bit better spec then the s7.

So the screen of the g6 is far better for me. I think you can find phones that are the same in price or in specs, but best is don't read too much reviews and go to a shop and play around with them. When it has 4 gig of ram and a processor of the latest 2 years it will be fine for day to day use. However if you need a phone that has the best of everything to show off with, look at a s9 or iphone x or even a v30. Phones that cost twice then this phone, everything has a price, personaly to much for that small noticable diffrence in usage. If an app opens up 0,0001 sec faster on those I don't care much. Camera whise it also personal, best camera I had was on the s7 or even the s5. G6 is a 8/10 whike the s7 was a solid 9/10 for the camera. Small diffrence maybe due to software.

A shaky hand can damage the sim tray ", "date": "28 Feb 2018"}, {"text": "I am writing this review after using this product for about 10months. So here it is. This product (black variant) was a birthday gift from my father on 10th May 2017 ( I recommended after a lot of research, of course).  It was worth 50k back then with an outdated processor (Snapdragon 821) whereas S8 offered Snapdragon 835. I still thought of putting my faith in it (No clue what got into me). Due to my extremely busy schedule, I set the phone on 12th May. It took about 5HRS for its first charge. I tried managing on and off until July ( because i did not wanted to switch to another phone as setting a phone takes a lot of time; At least for me). \r\n I got frustrated eventually since it lagged way too much, battery issue on charge time and drainage, visited the service center in July and they tried convincing me it was fine. After about 4 visits I managed to convince them to issue me a DOA certificate (dead on arrival). Got a new handset and damn, happy now. \r\nThe new product seemed to run fine, until around October is started off to lag. Lag real bad. I am a heavy user with using a tech for my work as well. \r\nWhile I was off on a trip to Dubai, the sim tray broke while I was trying to switch to a local sim. It still seemed to work fine until about a week back, 21/02/2018, when the battery drained overnight. I charged my phone next morning and switched it on, it seemed to not read one of my sim cards (airtel; vodafone seemed to work fine). I tried changing the slot and still the same. I reached out to an airtel outlet and the sim worked all fine in another handset. \r\nI reached the LG service center again, the guy suggests flashing the software (thereby losing all of my data for the 3rd time for the same pathetic product). Can't explain how annoyed (and equally helpless) I feel.\n \r\nPROS: \r\nI would surely take time to appreciate what's good. \r\n1. Camera- Outstanding. Can't beat the pictures clicked from it. \r\n2. Display- Beautiful colors and real bright and immersive display. 18:9 screen ratio gives a great experience. \r\n3. Battery- I wouldn't say good, but decent. Anywhere close to what other premium smartphones might offer. Unless, you are a one plus user. \r\n4. Fast charge- It really charges the phone good and fast. (The experience from the replaced model). \r\n5. Aesthetics- The phones looks premium and beautiful. Easy and comfortable to hold and operate.\n \r\nCONS: \r\n1. Sim tray- Extremely fragile. Handle with utmost care. \r\n2. Battery- At a price of 50k, offer better battery performance please. \r\n3. Processor- Stop being outdated. When others offered SD835, you offer SD821, and let me tell you, it wasn't worth the trust I put in the product. \r\n4. OS- It has been about a year almost, the Oreo update hasn't been rolled out. Now, when I pay 50k, I expect quality and service. I cannot wait for Android 8 when the world it prepared for the launch of Android 9. \r\n5. Customer Service- Real bad customer service. Extremely poor knowledge of the product. No audacity or manners to behave with the customer. Keep procrastinating the work. Extremely unprofessional.\n \r\nJUDGEMENT: \r\nDear LG, I have had food stored and cooked in your refrigerators and microwaves, had a TV for about 10years. I really like your products but please stop fooling and looting people by selling your phones. It is not your forte, not your genre. Please save your brand name and stick to what you are good at. You are not good at making smartphones. Face it. \r\nDear people, thank you for reading the review. I strongly support and promote LG all products (except smartphones). They are good with it.

Mine started the \"moisture detected in charging port\" (so charging is cancelled) about a month after I got it even though it is in an otter box and has never been exposed to water. You have to go out and buy a wireless charger because sometimes it just wont charge on the cord. Today for instance it charged perfectly for 30 minutes and at around 60% it decided there is moisture in the charging port... Other issue is sometimes it randomly starts vibrating an alarm about something with the usb. It doesnt stay on long enough to read it but it comes on and off in about 1.5 seconds, it will do it every second for hours, on off on off on off you have to shut down the phone to stop it.

Are you a heavy power user?  Did you leave the gaming battery saver off in the settings?  If you have any of these qualifications, then the G6 may overheat during game times.

You can play high-resolution 3D games but I'd recommend you just set them down to medium resolution rather than high.\n \r\nAs for the screen, the whole screen protection thing is unpredictable.  The G6 looks and is a solid device in durability but glass will break on any phone.  LG G6 is surrounded by Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and Gorilla Glass 5 on the back.  Gorilla Glass 3 is made to be more scratch resistant, meaning the glass is slightly harder, but also more brittle.  Gorilla Glass 5 is more shatter resistant, but more prone to scratches as well.

For starters, the presentation itself is disappointing with the lack of a prepackaged earphone since I really need some new earphones.  I do like the phone body itself though; the glass back design and full-screen experience is quite a change from my usual full bezel display that my LG L90 delivered.  All the buttons were working just fine and my camera lens was not plastic.  Bootup was quick and same goes to the fingerprint scanner too.  The display was especially vibrant, giving off nice hues, and remaining quite responsive.  My only gripe is the phone temperature with such settings.  My phone clocked at 50.3 degrees Celsius when I had the initial LG theme and max brightness on.  That isn't good.  I was pretty much forced to use the black theme and go to auto brightness to bring it down to a stable temperature (28 degrees Celsius).  As the UI goes, I really like it.  It has the same skin (close enough) to my L90 and the UI remains highly customizable, typical of Android powered phones.  Battery is good, with it going down in a stagnating pace and the quick charge juiced it up with no time.  I had a little bit of lag but it wasn't any concern to me since it does recover almost instantly and the Snapdragon 821 is still good enough for the next 4 years as I heard.  Camera quality is great, the UI is generous, and gives you a larger selection of options to play around with.  That wide-angle lens is especially joyful.  The sound quality is decent as usual, typical of LG, and it doesn't pose as a problem for music, unlike my L90, which contains static at max volume.\n \r\nOverall I really do like this phone.  It isn't anywhere near a \"bad\" phone and it runs just nicely after you compensate for certain situations and customize it.  It won't be as popular as Samsung's S8, or as fast as Apple's new A11 Bionic powered IPhone 8, but it remains as a very solid choice for any Android lover.  It contains very few gimicks, presents a professional vibe, and is backed by a very resonable price on certain carriers (500 USD for T-Mobile, 450 USD for Amazon, etc).

It lasts me a whole 7 hour school day and the afternoon including the commute to and from my home. \r\nMy only REAL problem is the camera. It's a bit of a weird story. You need to have good lighting or you won't get a good shot. If it's too dark, it looks like a sandstorm. The postprocessing on images is just horrible, which results in sub-par pictures. But, with the right conditions, you can get some good pictures. The wide-angle lens is basically the exact same thing as the primary lens, save for the wide-angle aspect of it. If fast, beautiful photography is what you're looking for, you should look elsewhere. \r\nIt's pretty similar to the Samsung S7 in terms of internal specs, though it only has 4 cores, so it won't be as snappy.

This phone has a 5.7 inch screen and U11 has 5.5 inch but the U11 has a wider screen which I prefer much more especially for typing, browsing and watching Instagram pictures. Strange thing is that when I compare Instagram pictures, not only is the picture on the U11 wider, but also taller. When watching Youtube in landscape mode, you get the black bars on both sides, and in combination with the narrow display you feel like watching videos on a 5.2 or 5.1 inch screen. On the U11 it's really great and immersive, it appears to be bigger. I think with these new 18:9 aspect ratios companies like LG and Samsung can brag about having such big screen with small bezels but you really get a smallish screen. It's ergonomic to hold and it's pocket friendly, but my hands are big enough to handle 'real' phablets and my pockets are big enough.

Speed is good just a little bit slower sometimes compared to U11 (Snapdragon 821 vs 835). The screen is not bad but less bright than U11, with 50% brightness on G6 it's the same as 30% on HTC. But it gets bright enough at 100% and is also viewable outside in the sun. I prefer the fingerprint on the front on U11 than G6's back fingerprint scanner but at least it works fast and accurately. The speaker sound is nowhere near the quality of U11 dual speaker Boomsound, but it's good enough for Youtube, Spotify, calling handsfree etc. I like holding the G6 more than my U11. The G6 has a flat back and squared off sides (I had a Galaxy s6 with the same style) and I always preferred that above a rounded back and sides. But the most important thing, the camera! The camera is good and in some cases great, but the U11 is much better in clarity especially in low light pics it's much sharper. The U11 even has a better camera than S8 and iPhone 7, so it's not a shame that the G6 loses to the U11 in camera performance. I bought the U11 for 650 euro and the G6 for 480 euro. I think the U11 is the better phone overall and I'll keep it as my main phone, but I'll keep the G6 too which says a lot about how I like the phone.

Basically a US released phone won't work on EU networks and vice versa. Not to mention Asian countries which have also their own frequencies. Your question regarding LG's decision I believe that LG already answered that by releasing LG G6+ which according to its specifications contains:  128GB of onboard storage as standard, wireless charging and 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC as standard, previously exclusive to only certain regions, and there's also B&O Play earphones included in the package.

You go to the homepage of GSMArena, then click on phone finder (the magnifier icon) on the upper left corner and select the criteria that you listed: \r\nScreen size: 5 - 5.7 inch (prefer 5.5) \r\nOS: Android 6/7 \r\nWaterproof \r\nCamera: at least 13mp main / 5mp secondary \r\nDual sim, dual standby \r\nDedicated slot for memory card  \r\n3/4 gb ram, 64gb rom \r\nThen a list of phones will come of your desired criteria. Then you go through the spec sheets of each phones, find out which of those serves you better. Then go to your nearest mall and try to get your hands on those devices. Then try to figure out which one you find the best considering all of the above criteria and your wallet-ability. \r\nConsidering that you want water resistant (not water proof, btw), the list should be very small and the devices are of flagship category of well known manufacturers. And if you are to go for Dual SIM and Dual standby along with dedicated slot for MC, then you are out of luck. Because you'll not find one until you go for Chinese manufacturers, and they don't do water resistant. \r\nSo I suggest you decide what is the 3 best criteria you want and then go for it. Personally, G6 is a damn good phone and cheaper than the S8. It gives you sturdiness, wide angle camera, cheaper price, yet when compared head to head with the S8, it gives a good fight (and wins sometimes). Yet I went for the S8. Because it felt better in my hand. My first 3 criteria were Good call quality, good looks and larger screen. Many of the phones out in the market matches those, but to me S8 felt better than others. G6 came a close second, followed by P10. \r\nGo, do some homework. It's not that I don't want to tell you, I do. But it won't be right. You're the one who's gonna be spending the money to use the device for a year at least. If you don't like it, then everything will be lost. I give it a $|-|!T what others say about Samsung Galaxy S8 (or Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or Sony Xperia ZL or Nokia N8 or any of my previous phones). As long as I'm happy about it, it doesn't matter what others think and say about it. And certainly dear, I don't know which will make you absolutely happy. Nobody here does as nobody knows you personally. So go and find it yourself. \r\nHope I could help you with the guidelines. Give a Kudos if you like what I said. \r\nTake care.

If you want a better camera, you better buy a stand alone camera or DSLR with the price you spend on phones. Phone cameras will NEVER be the same as DSLRs because of the small sensors. A phone camera should be for taking a quick photo when you didn't expect one and still be able to use it (post it in social media etc). I used to take my DSLR in parties and take photos there. Then I'd spend time to convert them to JPEG from RAW and then publish them. But it's not convenient. Now I just capture with my phone, post it even before reaching home from the parties.

But why is the Pixel having superior photos to the S7 Edge despite both having the same mp count, and even S7 Edge having OIS and f1.7 aperture (none of which are present on the Pixel)? It's because the sensor size of the Pixel is larger at 1/2.3\" (vs 1/2.5\" on the S7 Edge) so the individual pixels are definitely larger and allows more light when capturing in dark situations. Hence, Sony uses the same 1/2.3\" sensor but sacrificing resolution for bigger pixel means lower capable landscape detail shots. XZ is better than the Pixel in daylight shots due to the almost twice as many mp count, but low light goes to the Pixel, though the XZ still does a decent job of competing.
