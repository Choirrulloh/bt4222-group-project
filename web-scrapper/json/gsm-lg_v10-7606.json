There's occasional lags but bearable, it's not that bad given the chip in it. my unit sometimes have issues with the screen rotation, it could be with the app (MX Player) as it doesn't happen when using VLC or the built-in video player.

I paid about $10 each. I dumped the back cover and simply use  \r\nthe Obliq case, the battery stays in fine. the case comes off very easily as well. \r\nthe trick to getting the best battery life is A) not to use the same battery two days in a row,  \r\nB) not to charge the phone overnight and C) not let the battery fall below 30%.  \r\nall of these bad habits kill the battery. instead of plugging in the phone to charge the phone \r\n I just swap in another battery. I leave the house with one spare battery in my radix one slim  \r\nwallet just in case I run out of juice. I keep a spare in the car and a few on my desk at work. \r\n all my settings are on full blast, my screen is at full brightness. \r\n------------------------------------------------\u00ad------------------------ \r\nSome tips. To avoid image retention (ghosting) issue, you can install Nightly app from Play Store and  \r\nset its value at 80. If the display seems dim, use Lux Lite app to adjust and link the brightness to  \r\nyour preference. I have been using this combo for a month now and haven't seen a single ghosting issue.  \r\nSecondly, I believe the key to bootlooping is to not let your device overheat. You can use CPU-Z app to  \r\nkeep an eye on cpu temps and make sure the temperature does not go over 55c. Use Greenify to hibernate  \r\nunwanted user and system apps, it definitely improves battery life and minimizes drainage. Use CPU Spy  \r\napp to make sure that your device is going into sleep mode. If not, then there might be an app preventing \r\n deep sleep and draining battery; find it and Greenify it. Last but not least, disable Game Optimizer  \r\nfrom battery settings and it is also a good idea to clear all apps cache and restart the device once  \r\nin every couple of days. \r\n------------------------------------------------\u00ad------------------------- \r\nBackup Your Data Always. \r\n------------------------------------------------\u00ad-------------------------", "date": "19 Jan 2017"}, {"text": "Go For Note5,If You Dont Have Budget Problem.", "date": "19 Jan 2017"}, {"text": "Hello every one.

Just LPDDR3-RAM but 4 GB. \r\nA perfectly robust and gripped back design. \r\nThe camera is placed in the middle for symmetry, but the corner would be better. \r\nThe laser auto focus blaster could also be used for distance measurement with third-party applications. That could be very useful.\n \r\nBut their camera-application is a dream. It uses that second screen very well, and has many features. It might not be the fastest, and the burst shots are limited to thirty, but you can set framerate and bitrate and video resolution INDEPENDENT from each other. Every power-user dreams about that. Bitrate settings were possible previously on the Galaxy Note Two on Samsung, which was in 2012. There were quiality settings of low, middle and high. Low 1080p-video was equal to high 720p-video. Both were around 12 megabits per second. The V10 has no 5.1-Microphone, but the pro-mode displays the audio input from both microphones and gives you full control about photos and videos, which makes one feel like a real professional user. Additionally, pausing is supported in all modes (even slow motion), and it might be limited to 120fps, and there is no zero pause lag (known from Nokia 108, Samsung GT-i8000 and TouchWiz Camera v5.0 and higher), but I am looking forward to 2160p@60fps on phones in 2017. With 1440p@120fps, you can slow down to half, and yet have sixty frames per seconds TO SPARE. With \u00bc, you have 30fps instead of 15fps to spare. 15fps is the grey zone of enjoyability of videos.\n \r\nA physical shutter key is missing, (it could be used by applications such as games too, but would make shooting more convinient), but it has tap-to-shoot. Something, which Samsung removed in 2015 on their S6.\n \r\nThere is no way to launch the camera quickly with a physical shutter button, but the secondary screen can be used in a very similar way as the toolbox from the S5 and the Alpha, and the Edge-Screen of the .\n \r\n3000 mAh for such a power-user-phone might be slightly too low. The iPhone 2g was tvelve millemetres thick, and nobody had a problem with that. With that thickness, the V11 or V15 or V16 or V20 might achieve 6400 mAh (according to my calculations). \r\nMaybe, Samsung and LG could build together the ultimate power user phone, which contains the feature range from all phones. All sensors, all hardware, all features, and all capabilities, as long as it is possible. And maybe some additions (e.g. Dual IR blaster and reciever for 3D-aiming) and maybe a sligh optical zoom, if there are no external moving parts and other problems, ugly compromises(,) with camera hardware.", "date": "01 Sep 2016"}, {"text": "Buy samsung j2", "date": "01 Sep 2016"}, {"text": "Both are trash, bro.

Certainly more noticeable than the Soc performance.  \r\nThe real question should be why Samsung has any ram when they shut down apps constantly requiring annoying lags in performance.  \r\nThis ram on the V10 helps maximize it's 2nd screen feature accessing other apps without leaving their main screen, making calls or playing music.

The G4 and G5 user reviews from acquaintances that have had them expressed the same opinion with Samsung phones, which I have sworn by until their switch to a sealed form-factor with no removable battery or SD card slot with the Note 5/S6.  \r\nThen again, the only Samsung products I have ever owned were a Note 2 and 3, and never their low end products. \n \r\nThe nags were few and all but one were negligible; the most obnoxious was the softkeys--I actually prefer 'hard' softkeys since they don't take up the phone's screen space (but the height of the softkeys are adjustable in the settings!). Installing an FM receiver but not allowing access unless rooted is another \"Why?,\" since I live in an area where the weather fluctuates and we have power/utility outages during winter. The buttons take getting used to, and the fingerprint reader gets more confused as the phone's waketime extends past a week. \n \r\nPros? Lots: The camera is awesome and I am in search for a tripod mount for a phone now; the pictures are stunning and the settings are on par with a good PointNShoot. The ruggedness of the phone just allowed me to get a rudimentary case and screen protector rather than the bodyarmor that my otterboxes offered for my Notes, required for their fragility. Battery life is good since I am one that uses Greenify and turn off radios if they're in poor reception or not in use. If in a poor reception area battery's usually 2/3rds empty with light use during a 8 hr workday, but the quickcharger is a lifesaver.

Allow me to compare and contrast it to the H961N:\n \r\n1.The H962 comes with a charger that has an American plug. The H961N comes with an asian plug and will require a special adapter if you use it in the United States. So the H962 has what you need to charge it right out of the box in the US.\n \r\n2. The default language on the H962 is in english. The default language on the H961N is some asian language(probably Korean) and so when you boot the H961n up the first time the setup screen wont be in english. \n \r\n3. The H962 is not tied to any phone carrier. And so it has absolutely zero carrier bloatware apps and it also has absolutely no carrier tramp stamp on it. The H961N is tied to a Korean carrier (LG's Uplus carrier) and so you will see the Uplus stamp on the back of the phone, you will also see it on the boot up screen, and you will see plenty of korean language Uplus bloatware apps that will take an hour to uninstall. The H962 is the pure clean carrier free version and only shows the LG logo on bootup and has the LG logo stamp on the back. \n \r\n4. The H962 has an fm radio and comes with an fm Radio app installed on it. The H961N also has an fm radio with the radio app.\n \r\n5. Both the H962 and H961n provide the same band support in the United States. Neither will support 4G in the US.\n \r\n6. Both H962 and H961N have 64GB internal storage.\n \r\nSo with this, you can see that the H962 is the better variant to have over the H961n.

Within last 2 years I have been through an iPhone5,G3,S6 and now the V10. I don't care much about benchmark scores and who has the most this and that. However I dont know why I went with the S6 last go around. I was actually there for the G3 and the nice look of the glass on glass s6 got me. The S6 wasn't bad but like a lot of people might admit,the change wasn't good. I was to used to the \"no more side buttons\" feel of the Lg and didn't like the setup of the Samsung. I used it for 6months while patiently waiting for LG's newest smartphone. Seen this and loved everything about it. I'm not even using a case which I love bc i like being able to hold the phones true sleep shape. Honeslty guys some of you need to eat your Wheaties bc I swear one of the VERY first things I said to myself in the car outside after purchasing it was \"wow its bigger than my s6 but feels way lighter?\"(idk,maybe the s6 was just as heavy and I'm used to it?I doubt it). Also the screen,i used to look at the dimensions on paper/screen of these 5\"+ smartphones and think that it was just to much. But the way LG has done this 5.7(2.1 2nd screen) really doesn't seem to big at all and now I prefer these bigger screens to be able to see more. It's got this really cool feature where you can swipe across the bottom navigation icons and it will go into a one-handed operation smallest type screen. I have to mention how super slippery that S6 was in my hands and led to so many drops I had no choice but to purchase a case. This v10 with the rubber(actually Its made of a harder type material that is 5x stronger than plastic and feels like rubber) feels very good in my hands and provides the needed grip I need. The camera is just at the Top of the smartphone game,the s6's photos and videos were always so over saturated. Battery really isn't bad for me,some must be cranking up there brightness bc I leave mine on auto most of the time or 45%(doesn't sound bright but it is). Quick charging I don't know how fast it is exactly but it's pretty damn fast. Promo deal with memory card and battery charger a huge plus. Yea i can honestly say I learned my lesson and will be staying in the LG camp until I can find better. The only con I have found so far is the sound/speaker isn't the loudest. Its not bad sounding,just low. However,it has option for 32bit Hi-Fi when having headphones or speakers plugged in(so really not a con here). To me works out great bc wherever this phone goes 90% of the time my gear circle headphones are right along with it.  Yea whoever decides to grab one of these you won't be disapointed.
