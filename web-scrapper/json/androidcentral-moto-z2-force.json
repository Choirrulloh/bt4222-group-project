This is my third Motorola and Android smartphone (2015 Droid Turbo 2 and 2013 Droid Maxx, prior).\nI can't say enough positive things about this phone: Super responsive (iPhone X fast, perhaps?), excellent battery life, very fast Turbo charging, great Motorola camera app (much improved from earlier versions), very useful fingerprint sensor, usable voice recognition (both Google Assistant and Moto Voice), and more.\nMany misinformed web reviews (even from some of the most popular tech sites) almost steered me away from the Z2 Force, but I'm glad ignored them. \nCriticism of the Z2 Force's smaller physical battery size vs. original Z is off base, battery life is actually higher due to much more efficient Snapdragon 835 processor and other components. Also, most reviews over focus on Moto Mods, which I consider fairly useless (I own none), but the Z2 is still a great flagship phone without them.\nThe Z2's front fingerprint sensor is brilliant with Moto \"One Button Nav\" enabled to use finger swipes that are much faster than the standard Android home, app, and back buttons, plus it increases screen real estate for apps. It's also very fast for locking and unlocking with a quick touch -- I truly don't see how iPhone X FaceID can be faster or easier than this.\nPhysical size and weight of this phone is ideal if you use a protector case. Without one, it's too thin to grip, but that's the point of its design. IMO, most other smartphones become *too* thick with protective cases.\nVerizon's flexible glass screen protector is inexpensive and makes the Z2's plastic shatterproof screen look and feel as nice as any glass phone screen. I love that this Z2 (and my prior DT2) is shatterproof, it's already survived several hard drops with zero damage.\nThe new Moto camera app is a great improvement, very easy to use and some great features, and I now prefer it to iPhone and Google Camera apps. I especially love the Moto Action \"quick capture\" twist hand gesture to open the camera app (had this on DT2, as well), by far the fastest method I've ever used. I can twist the phone while coming out of my pocket, and the camera app will be open and ready to take a picture by the time I have it aimed at the subject (and while everyone else is still fumbling with their iPhones). I've snapped many great \"fleeting moment\" vacation shots thanks to this capability.\nThe Z2's dual camera lens Depth Mode effects are also fun. I've generated some very artistic blurred and black and white background style shots. Action mode multiple exposure works great too, very fast and easy to review and discard unwanted shots.\n(FYI, I've posted example depth mode photos in the sticky photo thread on this forum.)\nThe Z2 Force camera is still deficient vs other flagship phones in low light, esp. with its lack of optical image stabilization (OIS). But outdoor daylight shots are great. And FWIW, there are also some pretty positive reviews of the Z2 camera app's Professional mode by advanced photographers, too.\nThe \"chop-chop\" Moto Action hand gesture for flashlight on/off is brilliant, something I use multiple times every day on nighttime dog walks, in dimly lit rooms, in dark cabinets, etc. Seriously, it makes for the best flashlight I've ever owned, since it's instantaneous to turn on, very bright, and always in my pocket!\nMotorola also improved voice recognition by enabling both Google Assistant (\"OK Google\") and Moto Voice (\"Show Me\") to wake and unlock the phone hands free, something very few other brand smartphones can do. Moto Voice \"Show Me\" is a handy complement to \"OK Google\", I do use it regularly to open apps with my voice, near instantaneously, esp. when the phone is locked. \"OK Google\" on this Z2 works virtually the same as on my Google Home (in fact, both respond together when I'm home, which works fine). \nOther than low light camera improvements, the only other missing feature I anxiously await on my next Moto flagship phone (Z3 Force?) is IP68 waterproofing, which will be a de facto flagship trait in 2018 and beyond.", "time": "01-30-2018 05:58 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6153749", "text": "I know reviewers are heavily biased towards sasmung phones, i clearly didnt considered it in my list , but once i got hands on it, the snappy performance got me, i got one for around 375$ with free projector, after using for 2 months ,i think its far better performance than my Samsung phones.\nThe only problem for me is screen scratch issues which i know before buying it, had 3 tempered glasses before buyijg it.

Of course, by October you'll have more and even better choices available, perhaps even a Moto Z3. Either way, any new phone you get, sooner or later, will run much faster and last longer vs. your 3+ year old DT. (Unless you've replaced your battery, I'm guessing your battery life is way down by now.)\nTo be 100% clear, I didn't use a first gen Moto Z, so can't directly compare my Z2 Force battery life to one of those. But there are others on this forum doing so, plus many reporting better battery life than other current flagships they've used.\nIf you like the unique Moto gesture, voice, and display features on your DT, I think you'll really appreciate Moto's refinements and additions to them.\nOne thing last summer's Z2 Force reviews did get right, at the time, was complaints about its full retail price. On Best Buy + Verizon promotion last Oct, I paid closer to US$500 for mine, and then sold the free promotion Instashare projector Mod on eBay for $150.\nIf low light camera quality is important to you, then Samsung probably performs much better on that.\nOn Moto Mods, I can't help observing that nearly all of them have standalone counterparts -- Bluetooth speakers, compact digital cameras, Polaroid printers, battery packs, etc. -- that are a lot better and cost much less. And I don't see how snapping a speaker or projector onto the phone an advantage, if you then can't hold and use your phone, and have to fumble around removing/replacing its regular protective case to add the Mod.", "time": "01-31-2018 11:10 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6152294", "text": "You are spot on about the battery.

I also think the media is biased against Moto and ONLY looks at Samsung and iPhone. For those in the media reading this, get a clue. Take off the blinders and do your JOB and look at other devices. Yes its EASY to talk Samsung and iPhone, but life DOES exist outside Samsung and iPhone.

I LOVE the battery packs out there. They are subtle and sublime and don't really add much to the phone, yet significantly increase battery. I pretty much laugh at people that carry chargers and A/C adapters now. I keep mine in my coat pocket in case I need it. If I do, just pop it on the back and keep going with my day.

I have always liked Motorola take on a clean version of Android, I had previously owned a G series phone as a backup. I had used a LG V20 as my primary phone since launch, and was planning to upgrade to a V30. But after using the phone for a few weeks I kept it as my primary phone. The reasons why, the Android skin that Motorola applies is very lightweight, no lags, no stutter or freezes. The battery life has been great, not like the one on the Moto Z Play, but still great. The size of the phone is good for my needs, not too big nor too small. Also, I like the fact that Motorola still implemented the micro sd card, that is one feature that has kept me from getting a Google phone. There are few things that hopefully we will see in the next Z phone that would be good implementations. Such as waterproofing, better camera performance especially in low light, improved technology with there shatter proof displays and probably a much bigger battery. When I first bought a Z line phone was for my dad and it was the Moto Z Play. At that moment I did believe the mods where to expensive for what they offered. But with the Z Play we got the JBL speaker for free, at this point I have bought three style shells, the gamepad, incipio offgrid wireless battery pack, Turbo pack, Folio Mod, JBL 2 speaker, Hasselblad camera and i received the Insta Share Projector for free. I haven't spend over 300 in all the mods that I have, point is if you ever bought a Moto Mod full price, the you are doing it wrong. I have used all the mods in different scenarios, I swap between the style shells to provide a different look to my phone, the wireless battery pack when I'm at work, the Turbo pack during long days, my kids use the Insta Share Projector when we camp also in a cook out during the Super Bowl I was able to project the game as if we had a big screen, the Hasselblad camera has been used as well when camping and the JBL 2 speaker I use it at nights when listening to music. The Z2 Force is a great phone, even more if you can get at a discount price even better. When it comes to the mods all have their purpose, the ones a have bought have served me well so far and if you can get them for cheap even better. For example, Best Buy has the Hasselblad Camera Mod for 150 and if you buy three select mods they knock 25% off the price of all the mods.

I was a little upset. I hadn't been paying attention to the android world very well and I didn't think android had this headphone killing thing going on. But it hasn't been that bad. I did buy a 2 pack of headphone to usb c adapters and 2 of these bluetooth to 3.5 mm adapters. So it's a problem that can be solved with money and preparedness. But I know one day I'll be burned.

The only fallback I've had in this scenario is using the headphone jack, and I thank God it's there. Some people have older cars which do not have Bluetooth, what about there people? They shouldn't have to buy all these extra accessories as a workaround for a lack of a headphone jack. \nThere are other phones out there which have achieved being waterproof with the headphone jack so it's certainly doable.

(Measurements taken at <70% battery.)\nI'm particularly surprised the Motorola TurboPower 25W adapter bundled with my 2015 Droid Turbo 2 will *not* turbo charge Z2 Force -- no turbo charging notification, and drawing just 10W.\nInterestingly, Z2 Force takes longer to negotiate and enter turbo charging than the DT2, on all adapters, incl. the included one.\nDoes anyone know a software way to determine if the phone is turbo charging?

The other way doesn't always work because of changes to whether it prefers to overvolt or push amps, etc. QC 2.0 has 4 static modes available, but generally chooses between 5V 2A, 9V 2A and 12V 1.67A for 10, 18 and 20 W with the actual max power being at about 18W regardless of which setting it is choosing. QC 3.0 also has a practical max power of 18W but can vary the voltage dynamically from 3V to 20V with either 2.5A or 4.6A for current. \nThe short answer of this is, a QC 3.0 device is looking for 2.5A minimum as \"quick charging\" and a QC 2.0 charger cannot push more than 2A. A non Moto charger that is QC 2.0 i s going to show up as a max of 2A and therefore will never be considered Turbo Charging. The Moto 25 charger is slightly more nuanced, as detailed below.\nThe TurboPower 25 Charger does things slightly different, allowing for a max of 25W output, with 5V 2.85A, 9V 2.85A and 12V 2.15A modes. Depending on where it is in its steps, it's potentially only delivering 2.15A (with a max of 2.85A) even though it's capable of pushing to 25W, it's still doing so in a way that is recognized by the phone as being at a low voltage. If I recall correctly, the Turbo Chargers only \"turbo charge\" Moto devices. Otherwise they function as QC chargers for non Moto devices. The newst Moto Devices, which use the Moto TurbPower 30 (USB C) are able to accept 5V with a variable current up to 5.7A and they support USB PD. The TurboPower 30 charger supports that perfectly and will also rapid charge non QC devices that are compatible with PD. \nDumb question, but how are you able to charge the Z phones with the TurboPower 25?

But, I took a few dozen side by side comparison photos between my Z2 and my old LG G4. Now, while doing this, I learned a few things:\nFirst, the photos are only looking crappy while viewed on my Z2 (despite the screen otherwise looking amazing). When transferred to the PC and compared side by side on dual monitors, they actually look good, even slightly better than the LG. I'm not sure I understand how this could be happening. Although, I do notice something when I try to view a photo on the Z2... it very briefly shows me a good image for a fraction of a second then immediately replace it with a darker dreary image. I think the good image was the first pass then it does some more rendering of the image and says \"Ta dah!!! Here's the finished crappy image!\" Although, this is my first time encountering an image viewer that actually worsens the image in the second pass.... it's supposed to make it better!\nSecond, there's this round thingy in the center of the camera screen. I had just been ignoring it. If I click it so the circle becomes selected/highlighted, the image I'm seeing is then brighter and more colorful. The images I was taking yesterday were not done with this circle thingy in use. I do realize the little dot on the circle can be grabbed and make the image brighter/darker, although I'm surprised that the camera's default without this feature in use was so dark. My wife's Moto X Pure also has this feature but we never saw any dark dreary images from it by default.\nSo, I think I can stand down my initial panic that a $600 phone ($200 off at Best Buy now) had an awful camera, just a confusing camera. I'll still wait for a nice sunny day to do some more comparisons, but this is looking encouraging. Thanks for entertaining my ramblings about this. And, if anyone knows what's up with the 2-pass image viewer thing in the camera, I'd be interested in what anyone might know about it.", "time": "09-21-2017 05:23 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5987123", "text": "That\u2019s your focus and exposure.\nYou tap and slide it to set your focal point and tell the camera what to exposure for.

I can't trigger mine with my hand or any other object more than a foot away from the sensor. Does your fan happen to sit on the stand or is close enough to cause the stand to vibrate (or when/if its oscillating?)? Mine triggers on vibrations pretty easily. Lastly, (I must ask, lol) is there anything interfering with the sensor (screen protector missing the cutout)? \nHaving said of all of that I went and tested it out for myself thinking no way air could trigger the sensor. I stand corrected. I have a pedestal fan that sits 1 foot away from my nightstand and ~3 away from my phone.

And that little bit of thickness makes a difference. After using my Z2 Force for a bit, I picked up the Z2 Play at the store and it felt super thick. Most of the time, now, I just run a style shell because the built in battery is enough. Though I did pick up a battery mod at Best Buy that was on clearance, I don't really have any need for it unless I'm going to Disneyland or something where I might see heavy usage (stupid lines) without any chance of charging the whole day.\nI will say about style mods though, I wish they had metal plates or something built in so I can use my magnetic car mount.

I'll need to use the phone for at least a week before I'm ready to call it \"good\" or \"bad\", but so far I have no complaints.\n2. Camera. I have to warn you that I am not super picky about smartphone cameras. Generally all the previous Motorola's I have owned have suited my limited needs. That being said the few shots I have taken so far have been fine for me. I will post some after I have a good variety taken over the weekend.\nThe Good:\n1. Software. Motorola continues to knock this area out of the park. Phone has the standard Motorola interface we have come to love over the past 4 years. It is buttery smooth and I haven't encountered a single stutter yet. There has been one pleasant surprise: while I don't think it is the full google pixel app, the phone app does now incorporate local searches much like the google version. Very nice feature that I have been side loading for the past few years. One Button Nav: I understand this feature isnt for everyone I suggest that you give it a try. It's awesome once you get used to it. There was a software update waiting when I first turned the phone on. It claimed to fix a \"battery meter\" problem. The update was performed in the background and required a reboot at the end, which is the first time I have encountered this process. Very convenient compared to the old method that took away your phone for the duration of the update.\n2. Hardware. After all the hoopla about reduced battery size for thinness this phone is beefier than I was expecting. It is not as thin feeling in my hands as I was led to believe by most of the reviews.\n3. Here's a pleasant little quirk: the included charger does the 5V\\3A (PD) quick charging as well as Qualcomm quick charge 2.0. I'm not sure if any other charger out there can do that.\n4. Display: very good, no complaints. After the hoopla over the scratch ability, the first thing I did upon opening was to put a cheap glass screen protector on. So far despite being only $6 it has been doing the job. I do not have the \"crinkling\" sound some reviewers have reported. I'm inclined to believe that particular problem was confined to pre-production models.\nThe Bad:\nSo a couple of nitpicks that I want to relay:\n1. SD card. For whatever reason (maybe because of Sprint?) you can't make the SD card integrated storage. This is the first time I've run into this restriction on a Motorola phone, and it's annoying.\n2. Sprint bloatware. Lots of it. Good news is that almost all of it is deletable or can be disabled. \n3. Here is a minor annoyance. Recently Sprint released a MySprint app on the Play Store. On other Sprint phones, the My Sprint app would download and automatically replace the old Sprint Zone app. For some reason on this phone when I downloaded the My Sprint app, the Sprint Zone app remained, so I have both. Annoying.\nSo that's all I have for now.

This is a step down from the Moto G5 Plus I recently had, but that's not a fair comparison as the G5+ had the best battery life of any phone i've ever owned, including the 3900 Mah Droid Turbo.\n2.

This is the first Sprint phone I've owned that allows the user to access APN settings. I'm not quite sure what that signifies.\n3. Dialer: As I stated the default dialer is the google one that includes the \"nearby\" places feature. Very useful, and from what I gather none of the other versions of the Z2 force include the nearby places feature.\n4. Voicemail. Sprint's standard android voicemail app is included. It includes adds unless you want to pay extra. Annoying.\n5. Wifi calling is a part of the software, and it works fine. The only drawback is that Sprints HD voice codec is disabled when wifi calling is enabled. Recently Sprint's Samsung S8 phones were updated to \"calling plus\" which is a VoLTEish service that allows data and voice calls simultaneously.

Battery life is surprisingly good. I previously had a Moto Z Droid and battery life does not seem significantly reduced, comparatively. I am a pretty heavy user and generally average 4-5 hours of SOT with both phones. Also notable is the battery drain over night is nearly non-existent. \nThe camera is a completely different story. The new camera is utter garbage in anything but excellent light. Evening lighting in a living room results in grainy photos no matter how hard you try. HDR is a waste of time because it requires such a slow shutter that pictures are always blurred. I have minimal video experience, but it also seems lower quality than the original Z Force. \nThe phone looks and feels phenomenal in person and I actually appreciate the reduced weight. I actually don't use a style she'll most of the time because it feels so great already. I do use a bumper case just in case I drop it- I don't want scratches on the metal or screen. Speaking of, I prefer to use Armor Suit screen protectors for the Moto Z line due to it's flexibility for the plastic screen. \nThe last thing I want to mention is that the New Z2 Force should realistically be compared to the non-Force line last year considering it's size and camera setup. The Force last year was a Droid- meaning Verizon had a hand in the final specs.

It has some very notable strengths - in VERY dark lighting with a very steady hand, and HDR enabled, you can take some impressive pictures. Medium indoor lighting, especially when you're trying to snap a quick picture of something and not completely steady, are a complete crapshoot. Autofocus does seem to be extremely fast in all conditions.\nImage stabilization in video recording is completely useless; it's constantly cropping and shifting the frame abruptly. 1080p60 video with a steady hand looks infinitely better, however ironically the autofocus in video mode is TOO fast and also leads to the frame jumping around a lot as it tries to refocus. \nOverall the software experience as it relates to the camera could use a lot of refinement.\nI'm pretty happy with the rest of the device experience though. As many of the professional reviews noted, it seems like the performance is on par with any other SD835 device.

David has also picked up some deep gouges in his screen.\nNow, you would expect a few scratches on a screen made of plastic\u2014it's more resistant to impact but much softer than glass. However, the plastic Moto used this year is obviously softer than what it employed in 2016. My Moto Z Force review unit has been clunking around in a drawer with other phones for most of the last year, and it's barely scratched at all. That's in addition to being actively used for a few weeks last year. After less than a week, the Z2 Force is already more scratched. The scratches aren't always visible when the screen is on, but when the light hits at the right angle, you'll see them.\nI'm not even sure how most of these scratches happened. The phone has been in my pocket or on my desk the whole time. Well, I guess I do know how one of them happened. You see, when I first noticed the scratches, I did what I would do with any phone\u2014I ran my fingernail across the area to see if it felt like a scratch or just some gunk that would come off. I confirmed they were, in fact, scratches, but also accidentally added a new scratch with my fingernail. This should not happen ever, but especially not on a phone that costs $800.\nSince I have the previous Z Force handy, I was able to compare the screens directly. On the Z2 Force, a fingernail is enough to scratch the display. This is not true of last year's Z Force. I can't think of any reason Motorola would downgrade the materials, but that's what it did.\nFrom what we understand, Motorola changed the design of the ShatterShield screen this year to make it thinner. Part of that process included bonding the plastic cover to the display. Thus, you can't remove it like you could on the Z Force. So, if it gets massively scratched up, you would need to replace the entire AMOLED panel instead of just a plastic sheet.\nThe adhesive holding the plastic layer in place seems insufficient, too. Of the two units we've tested, both make a \"crinkling\" noise when you press in certain places. The plastic appears to be popping up slightly after being pressed down, like the adhesive isn't strong enough to hold it. The sound is very noticeable around the fingerprint sensor and at the top near the earpiece.", "time": "07-31-2017 11:47 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5908426", "text": "Yikes!

Many of them were negative but that wasn\u2019t what made me disappointed. What made me disappointed was the lack of diversity among those tasked with writing reviews and their lack of inquisitiveness.\nI couldn't find an online review written by a female. I\u2019m sure women buy smartphones as often as men do. There was also not much diversity in age. I'm sure that smartphones are used by people of all ages. The narrow perspective is disappointing.\nMany of them complained about things they didn't like but didn't inquire about why a decision was made. I'm glad some of them asked those questions but I wish more of them did. Maybe the company will just give marketing spin as an answer but at least it gives more insight.\nFor example, many of them complained about the lack of a headphone jack. They realized that the Moto Z2 Play includes a headphone jack and is just a hair thinner than the Z2 Force. Perhaps Motorola opted not to include it because they think wireless audio or digital output is the direction of the industry. Perhaps they wanted to use that space for some other component in the screen. All they had to do was ask...\nAnother thing I found puzzling was how some of them viewed Moto Mods. It\u2019s okay if the reviewers think the current mods are too expensive or the mods are not useful for them. But the Z series phones were designed with mods in mind. That is why they have keep the same shape, have the exposed connector pins and why the camera is raised. If they take some time to understand the \"Moto Mod\" platform and understand it at a basic level they are really not able to give a thoughtful review.\nI hope in the future there will be a more diverse set of reviewers and more inquiring of why product design decisions were made.

Current phone is a Droid Turbo 1 which is still peforming well although it has battery charging fatigue and I sometimes can't get through a whole day anymore. \nI almost bought a Moto Z Force Droid and I really wanted to like the Moto Z2 Force. \nLooking at this forum and knowing what I know from reading the Z Force forum, here are some things I figure someone would need to buy to bring this thing up to flagship status. \n1. Battery pack mod. Moto put a 2,730 mAh battery in the Z2 Force, down from the 3,500 mAH battery in the original Force Z. So I'd need a battery mod to get through a whole day. Since I have a Tylt wireless charger, I'd want one that could charge wirelessly. Either the Tumi or the Incipio. That's an additional expense of $89 or $99 depending on which was purchased.\n2. Screen Protector. It's ironic that the Z2 Force comes with a shatterproof screen that is also easily scratched. The flexible glass protector from Verizon is frequently cited as the one to get, so that's another $24.99.\n3. USB-C headphones. Technically not needed if I use the dongle adapter included but hey, eventually I'm going to need USB-C headphones so that's another $29 to $39.\n4. Style shell back. Maybe I think the Z2 Force is too thin and hard to handle or I want to protect the protruding camera lens housing. Or I want to change the look of the phone when the battery mod is not installed. Better get a style shell back. That's $19.99 or $24.99. I could get the wireless charging back from Moto for $39.99.\nSo, let's see...that's an additional $163 to $202 extra to bring this phone up to speed.

Time will tell. The Tumi wireless battery pack is currently $60 from Verizon.\nRe 2: It probably won't take long for Amazon to have some pretty decent screen protectors for more like $10 for 2, but anyone buying on or really near launch day will probably need the $25 Verizon one. BTW, don't put too much value in a \"lifetime warranty\" on a screen protector. They'll charge you $10 shipping for replacements, so you'll be paying basically the same money you would for a new one (or pair, possibly) from Amazon anyway. The warranty is a gimmick IMO.\nRe 3: I don't think I'd bother with USB-C headphones, personally. You can get extra USB-C to 3.5mm adapters on Amazon pretty cheap, so just buy a few & put them with your fav headphones you already have and convert them. If you need new headphones anyway, you might go USB-C, but it might be just as well to go Bluetooth. The USB-C headphones won't work with a lot of other audio equipment, so it's a pretty specialized purchase.\nRe 4: You should be able to find the Incipio style shells for more like $10.
