It was a bit of a PIA getting it activated with Sprint, but that was on Sprint's side not Moto's fault.\nIt's an upgrade in every way over the G4 plus with the possible exception of the screen, which is smaller and seems a little less bright than the G4 plus.\nThe biggest area of improvement is battery life and the processor. I got 5 hours of SOT yesterday which is probably better than any phone I have ever owned including the old Droid Maxx or Droid Turbo. The phone performs flawlessly and I'd bet if you handed it to random people on the street 90% would never guess this isn't a $700 phone.\nThere are few software differences between the G4 and G5, and most of the few changes are for the better. I particularly like the one button fingerprint controls instead of the on screen buttons. It is a useful and non-obtrusive software modification that feels like it came out of googorola days. It took me about 4 or 5 hours to get used to it and I'm not going back. One software difference I don't like is the new active display widget which doesn't seem necessary, but I can live with it.

Just take the SIM out of your current active Verizon phone and put it in the G5. It will work. If you take it in, most Verizon employees will pretend that because you didn't buy the phone from them they can't activate it and then try to up-sell you for a commission.\nA lot of people complained about Verizon's inability to activate the G4 plus when it was first released and I'm convinced 95% of the problem was either unscrupulous or just plain dumb Verizon employees.", "time": "04-02-2017 09:57 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5740561", "text": "Thanks for that advice.

In order to return to an official state, three things must occur. \n1) You must flash an official image that is the same or newer version than what you have installed\n2) You must (re)lock the bootloader, which requires #1 to occur\n3) You must accept an OTA update and allow to apply properly (only way to change status \"Modified\" to \"Official\" after relocking the bootloader)\nBe aware that Moto does NOT release or support any factory firmware images, the only ones we have have been leaked out and we do not have the latest versions for any variant, and some variants have newer version (1 or 2 versions old) and some are much older (Marshmallow versions). This means #1 is difficult to do. Item #2 is simple, if you can accomplish #1 . \nAt this point, you would be back to as pure stock as is possible, although the software status would show \"Modified\" or unofficial, there should be no errors or issues with software or other services. Getting the status of \"Official\" does require accepting an OTA from this state.\nRemember that you can NEVER completely hide the fact the device has been modified. Your bootloader status can never be set back to 0 (LOCKED), but only to 2 (RE-LOCKED). Warranty can never be reinstated, once the unlock code has been issued by Moto, regardless of whether it is used or not, the warranty is void. Even if the bootloader has been relocked, the Bootloader Unlocked warning screen will still be displayed on every startup (this can be masked with a custom logo.img, but any subsequent update with clear it again). \nThe real question here should be what problems are you having, what have you done, and can these issue be corrected?

Open each of those and tap Storage, then Clear Data (you will not lose any data, only the databases are deleted), and then reboot. After the phone appears to be up and operating normally let it sit for at least 5 minutes for the databases to rebuild automatically (there is no notification this is occurring or completed) and then reconnect the USB and try to access your files.\nThe other issue is with your computer... there are some issues with USB drivers, there can be OS corruption of the configuration, and hardware defects. First try a different USB port, preferably one of a different \"type\", meaning if you had it connected to a USB 3.0 port, try a USB 2.0 port, or vis-versa. If this fails, I would recommend downloading a Linux image and make a live bootable USB flash drive and boot to that, then connect the phone and see if you can access it (Linux requires no drivers to talk to an Android device), if you can you have a Windows or driver problem, if it doesn't work you likely have an odd hardware compatibility.\nOne last thing would be trying to connect the phone either after a booting in Safe Mode, or after a factory reset.\nOf course, all of this can be eliminated if you just use Google Photos to automatically backup all your photos online... you don't need to physically connect your device to your computer at all, just go to https://photos.google.com to access all your pictures at anytime.", "time": "09-07-2017 10:47 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5962441", "text": "There should be no need for any special \"import\" program.\nAfter you connect the phone to the computer, unlock the security screen, and accept the computer connection, can you browse the phone like a hard drive using Windows File Explorer?

For now, I am just trying to understand what happened to my photos, how they are organized, and where they are stored on my phone. I have a 128GB SD card installed and I have modified my camera settings to store my photos on the memory (SD) card.\nWhen I use the Google Photos app on my phone, I see things I do not expect and cannot figure out. For example, the DCIM/Camera folder on my SD card contains about 285 images. But when I open Google Photos, I only see 6 photos under \"Camera\".\nWhen I snoop around in the phone's storage, I start at the phone's storage settings (see below).\nThen I tap Internal Shared Storage (see below)\nThen I tap Images (see below)\nThe things that confuse me:\n1. There are multiple folders with the same name (e.g., there are two Camera folders and not shown in the screen shot are two more GroupMe folders for a total of 3).\n2. None of these folders contain only those six photos that Google Photos is showing me under \"Camera\".\n3. The Camera folders each contain 200+ images but Google Photos is not showing them to me. \nCan someone explain the design, rationale, approach that makes sense out of what looks like a confusing structure?

So you may lose a bit on general performance (especially with the 2GB version). I'm not sure about the iPhone 6's camera performance in low light but Motorola cameras has never been very good in low light. So if your iPhone 6 is good in that respect, you'll lose a bit there too. Motorola cameras tends to also lose a bit of the color in pictures: people look paler in certain settings. They're not generally known for their cameras.\nOtherwise, although I don't own a Moto G5 Plus, Motorola/Lenovo generally have great performing phones on low/mid-range budget phones. So that shouldn't be a problem as such.\nNow if you're able to pay a bit more and don't absolutely need to get a Motorola device, you could also go with a OnePlus 3T or a Samsung S7 which are high end phones but that don't cost all that much. Both devices have pretty good cameras.\nI personally have an S7 right now which has a great camera but am looking forward to the Moto Z2 Play that should come out in the coming months (I'm a stock Android fan and Motorola are the only devices I can affort :P). So when that comes out I'll sell my S7 to buy out my contract and get that new Motorola device (camera performance have never been really important to me).\nHope this helped!", "time": "04-29-2017 05:38 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5793233", "text": "I have the 4GB/64GB version of the G5 Plus and I agree with what dialonde said.

My comparison is against the 2015 Moto X pure Edition. So far I am most impressed by the G5 battery life. Under heavy use I'm getting well over one day of usage. The feeling that I need to carry a charger around with me is gone with this phone. Streaming music and YouTube videos along with Facebook messenger and multiple phone calls throughout the day I haven't had one hiccup yet. \nI like the One Touch navigation feature and I have been using it since I unboxed the device. There is a learning curve to it but once you get the hang of it it's a Nifty trick and it adds to the uniqueness. Nougat runs well and split screen works very well. \nThe biggest negatives in my opinion are the single firing speaker and the absence of the \"wave to wake\" feature my Moto X has. Dropping from a 5.7 inch higher end display to this G5's 5.2 took a little time to adjust too but ultimately found it not to be an issue. The camera on the G5 is hit and miss. I've taken some impressive photos in the daylight but once the sun sets it's a whole other story. I think the Moto X could edge the G5 out but only slightly. \nSome things I haven't tested are HD video recording, the headphone input, or streaming Bluetooth audio to a car. The lack of NFC doesn't bother me. \nOverall I'd recommend the phone as a replacement for the Moto X.
