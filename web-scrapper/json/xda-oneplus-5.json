Because its not a hardware flaw, its a \"design choice\". The Display (of every current OP5 out there right now) is mounted upside down, meaning the direction the phone refreshes its display is from the bottom towards the top. \nWhile this is not a defect or problem from a technical point of view, it can still be perceived by a lot of people, since our brains are usually expecting the panel to refresh from the top towards the bottom. The Jelly comes due to the panel not updating all pixels at once but by line after line instead.. our brain gets used to the bottom of the screen beeing updated later and simply ignores it (very rough explanation but im missing the needed vocab here).. the screen refreshing towards the top the messes with some peoples perception, therefore they notice the \"Jelly\" aka the lines refreshing last at the top..\n\nThis issue is purely caused by our brain expecting the panel to refresh from a different direction, so its simply a matter of getting used to it. I had headaches when using the phone in the first week or so, now I barely notice the Jelly, if at all. \nSome, like me, will notice it instantly at first, others might never (Just like the discussions over frame rates, input lag and so on  ). There are several factors to consider, everyone has a different sensitivity towards stuff like this and in the end, remember, its no hardware flaw, its a design choice and technically present on every OP5.\nUnless they decide to either change the way the display refreshes within the Driver or Display Controller (well, that would actually be some serious work and would need cooperation with Samsung due to them producing the Displays and the Drivers, if its possible at all - again, several dependencies here) or change the direction of the screen in a later model, the \"Jelly - Issue\" will consist.\n\nBut hey, you are right in your other post, if you dont see it, be glad about it and dont bother to start looking for the Issue, no point to try to search for flaws that you didnt have for now, be happy with your phone \n\nJust trying to clear up some of the confusion \n\nYet, this shouldnt be the topic of this thread, since this is about Scrolling smoothness, which has nothing to do with the Jelly Effect....\n\n---Back to topic---\n\nFor me, it hasnt been the smoothest experience to be honest.. while the phone is crazy fast, the overall handling feels very jittery.. Lots of dropped frames, way more than on my Nexus 5 running MIUI.. My N5  and my iPhone 6 feel so much smoother..\n\nMight have to mess with custom kernels and so on a bit more, overall it at least feels smoother than an S8 tho", "time": "25th August 2017, 09:34 PM", "postID": "post73540914", "replies": [{"text": "Yep I do understand how the jelly effect happens, and I understand that \"some people\" have this gift of being able to see it whilst everyone else \"me\" are left thinking the world has gone mad.\n\nI've honestly put my two cents in here so many times and it's fallen on deaf ears by the sounds of things so I'm going to leave it, I don't have this effect on my phone, not did I on my previous oneplus five, I have video recordings of the screen in use and this jelly effect does not present itself, I'm sure that with video slowed down even me with my eyes could see it ? \n\nEven if all that were true, if I have to be watching things in slow Mo to see them then I think it's safe to say that it's something that I don't have to worry about.\n\nI also personally don't have lags and glitches on my device, I've also owned more devices than the average shop so i do have a basis for comparison, not only that but I have an unlimited phone supply partly due to where I work, comparing my phone side by side with any top tier device yields no other reason to believe anything other than what I've just written and that's not just me that's my work colleagues seeing the same.\n\nAppreciate that yourself and others see this issue probably more than I. \n\nIf you have a fool proof way of me testing my device then please let me know and I'll check, I'll record it and I'll apologise profusely if its present.", "time": "26th August 2017, 02:17 AM", "postID": "post73542769", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"text": "I haven't notice any of the \"jelly effects\" ..ok I havent recorded my screen and play the exported video in -x16 speed to check it either..", "time": "25th August 2017, 08:22 AM", "postID": "post73532498", "replies": []}, {"text": "People are way to focused on the jelly here, I really don't mind it.\nWhat is worse for me is the stuttering.
