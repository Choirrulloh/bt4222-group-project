I have been using Bixby for sometime now. It took time to get accustomed to the accent that Bixby would understand but now with better updates it has become far more easier. I hope Samsung keeps developing Bixby integration with OS & Apps as it might be really helpful as an assistant. \n \r\nThe camera has been excellent till now...Although I have had some problems in low light with additional noise creeping in pics as compared to other flagships. The edge display is cool, however, sometimes just holding the phone leads to accidental touch. I guess this is a problem with bezel less phones. I would say I am not a heavy user...but an average phone usage of about 6-8 hours daily. The battery is sufficient for a day's usage at Full HD resolution...lasts about 2-3 hours less on QHD. \n \r\nMusic quality is better with the given AKG tuned earphones if they are adjusted with the Adapt Sound feature. It just amplifies the frequencies that you hear less to adjust the overall sound. Its a neat trick packaged as a significant improvement. \n \r\nThe fingerprint sensor position is really difficult to access and smudges the camera. Also the HR sensor requires positioning the finger in a particular fashion to enable the sensor to take the reading. I hope samsung corrects this in next flagship release.\n \r\nI have been using Samsung Dex for sometime now. Its a good option if you dont have to carry a tablet or laptop. However, it needs a screen with close to HD resolution. I faced problems connecting it to DVi/VGA as sometimes the resolution gets affected badly. However, I liked the interface Dex creates. Its simple. However, there are very few apps that adapt to the resolution so we would have to wait till the compatibility increases. \n \r\nOverall, its an amazing phone.

Trust me the only iphones worth skipping the s8 for are iphone 7plus, 8plus and iphone x. If u hate big phones like i do then your only option should be iphone x which costs almost twice the price of s8 for if you are getting 256gb even tho its basically an s8 with apple logo, os and well a11chip which so far only real world advantage is boot up time(lol).

I don't need to awkwardly looking at it in wide eyes and unfriendly location in front of your face. \r\nDEx is good. It will definitely turn your boss's and colleagues' heads (mine does). But that's it. DEx needs a long way to go to replace your laptop or notebooks. But it works amazing with your Office\u00ae files (though you need to buy it).

No matter what we say, your confusion will not go. For example, I seldom use my fingerprint scanner. I use the iris scanner instead and it's damn fast. The more you use it, the faster it becomes. \r\nFor the placement of Bixby button and fingerprint scanner, you should check those yourself, no alternative. \r\nBut if you ask me, here is my opinion: \r\nIf you want to play heavy games with smooth experience, blindly go for iPhone. I will personally vow for it that the experience will blow your mind off. But, you will lose productivity, customization and use of ease. Until and unless you have the Apple environment, unless you own a MacBook, an iPad and an iPhone, you will not enjoy the usability of Apple products. \r\nOn the other hand, if you want customization, ease of use, productivity (that's mostly for Samsung, other manufacturers are far behind in productivity, in my opinion), then Android should be your choice. \r\nThen again, in Android you get wireless charging, fast charging etc whereas in iPhone you get none. And the battery of an iPhone is relatively smaller than that of any flagship Androids. \r\nAs I said, you have to go and check and do some research yourself. Don't bias your judgement by asking us \"what would you like?\" and buy something and regret later. \r\nI know I have my own reasons to stick into Android over iOS, heck, I prefer Samsung over most other Android manufacturers out there for things that most people mark as \"gimmick\". But that's me. You gotta justify your purchase. \r\nI have heard that people had problems with their S8 & S8+, but I had none, neel, zero (till now). So I guess there is a bit of luck involved as well. At the end of the day all of these are electronic products and may fail any time. There are thousands of iPhone users complaining about their iPhones, just go and check their pages. Same goes for Samsung, Sony and other manufacturers. But there are also customers who are satisfied to the fullest. You have to take that risk. \r\nHope you will go out and check the phones by yourself and only then ask further questions. Because it seemed to me that you are asking the same question round and round and we're answering them. \r\nAnd if you are planning to buy a phone 5-6 months later, start researching before 3 months of your purchase.

So S7 & S7e will have more price drop. It's almost out of the market now and I found only 2 handsets in the market (just a few days ago, 18th Aug, 2017). \r\nNow, there is the factor that what I might like, you may hate. I love my S8, but when I wanted to buy one for my wife, she declined, telling me that it's not justified to buy a phone with BDT 78K. I brought mine in pre order, got a DeX (worth BDT 15K) & a 128GB mem card free (worth BDT 8K). In total my phone costed BDT 55K. Even I wouldn't buy an S8 right now with BDT 78K. So we went for an S7e, couldn't found a new one in black color, so had to purchase a used one. \r\nIn 5-6 months, you have to see what is the market value of S7, S7e & S8, S8+. Again, what is your preference? I know nothing about your preferences. S8 is a great phone. If you have enough money to spend, then close your eyes and buy S8. If you don't have enough money like me, decide, compare, see what is there you can go on with, what is there you must need and what is there you don't want. See what phone has those. It's totally up to you what to buy. And about the screen size, go to the market and check for yourself. What is big for someone may turn out to be just fine or small for others. To me personally, I love the screen of S8. \r\nSo, I ask you to go on and do the research yourself. Here everyone will boast their own preferences to you. Apple users will tell you, \"None, both are crap. Go for iPhone 7\". Sony users will say for Sony, Sammy fans will ask for Samsung. So, you better go and check it for yourself. \r\nJust because everyone else is using something doesn't mean you have to use that too. One of my friend went to buy S8 & brought back Huwawei P10. That is another great phone. Even 1+5, upcoming 1+5T or 5S (whatever it is naming) is going to be good. So I ask you to go and check them for yourself. make a list of what you want, what you need and what you don't want/need. Then make a checkbox under each models and see which covers your wants and needs more. Then check for price and other things. \r\nAnyway, don't want to make it any longer. Choose wisely.

Samsung can do a handful of tricks which Moto cannot? \r\nFor example, if someone calls you and you decline, S8 will remind you in 10 mins about that call and will keep reminding you until you cancel it or call that person. I can bet your Moto m64 can't do that. \r\nAgain, S8 has IP ratings of 68 whereas Moto has no IP ratings. That means, your Moto will not survive a dip in the rain whereas S8 will happily dive under water for you. \r\nThen, with S8's dual camera mode, you can take pictures with both the front and rear cameras at the same time. Wanna bet that Moto won't do that? Again, we should not forget that Samsung has one of the best (if not the best) phone cameras in the world right now. \r\nShould I continue? Well, here goes - \r\nS8 has BT5.0 that can throw sound from one application to the speaker while sound from another app to the headphone. Use of it? Well, I always listen to music. But sometimes my son wants to play games as well. I can put him in the phone speaker while running the music player on the background to my BT speaker in the other room. Got it? \r\nS8 has wireless charging, DeX capabilities (those who never used one will not understand) and the list goes on. \r\nSo, dear, the value of a phone is not about the hardware, but it's software and the brand value as well. I can guarantee you that the cost of making this phone was not more than 300USD. But they have R&D, Marketing and other departments who make amazing things happen in Samsung (for example, I used to have multiple screens in my Note4 when Android couldn't do that natively, curved screen always make my S8 a center of attention). Don't, please don't compare Motorola, Oppo, Xiaomi with Apple, Samsung, Sony. I know, now you will say that Motorola first build the mobile phones. YES, I know. That is why they are still in the market. But in this competitive flagship markets, for the last few years, Motorola couldn't show any magic (Moto friends are not some magic to me as you have to purchase them separately). \r\nAnyway, hope you will get to your senses. I would even consider if you would compare S8 with the upcoming iPhone 8. That would truly make sense. Well, iPhone will cost you a kidney, for the same reason. Never compare a Mercedese with a Tata Nano, ok? be smart. \r\nCiao...", "date": "21 Aug 2017"}, {"text": "I am a moderate to heavy user.

Even today its the same problem I ended up spending thousands for a screen guard. Back panel is very sensitive to scratches and can break very easily.

If I'm completely honest I'm no guru when it comes to analysing every single aspect and specification of every single phone on the market to determine what phone comes out on top and I know that the people who can do that are in the minority.\n \r\nI find that many people that frequent mobile forums have a kind of football supporters mentality and will defend their preferred manufacturer or bash other brands and I would bet they have no real knowledge. I mean how many people own every current phone on the market and can evaluate each one on it's own merits without prejudice....not many I would guess.... yet it seems in my experience and in my own humble opinion, many peoplr suddenly become an expert..... and I just can't be bothered with all the fan boy nonsense, does my nut in ...... I find it immature.\n \r\nI picked the S8 Plus because I wanted a big screen that had a great display and it was endorsed by many of the reviewers that I respect, I checked out the compare tool on gsmarena with current phones on the market ..... and if im honest I loved how the phone looked (blush) I also had a S6 Edge previous to this so I thought it would seem quite familiar as well.\n \r\nI'm really happy with the phone itself, although it has its shortcoming e.g I loved the look of the phone but here I am with a case on it!!!!! That to me is madness!!!! But i genuinly dont think i could keep it in reasonable condition if I didn't protect it... that annoys me..... also Bixby in my opinion has been a marketing disaster, I have a dedicated button on my phone for a beta lol and the voice isn't even up and running yet lol ......... is it the best on the market overall?  I genuinely don't know, does anyone truly know? \n \r\nTo me at least it does everything and more that I want it to. We all have our reasons to go for a particular phone and budget is a factor too. I will defend anyone who is happy with the choice they made regardless of the brand and anyway I embrace good healthy competition amongst manufacturers because it benefits us all in the end as technology progresses at a greater pace as each one strives to be more innovative ..... \n \r\nAnyway I think I'm waffling on a bit and don't know if I have made any sense. \n \r\nThanks for your reply :)\n\n\n\n", "date": "25 Jul 2017"}, {"text": "well if you want me to spell out what i mean in stead of using a phrase that comes close.... \r\nthe S8 does many things that no one phone can match. but is not the best of any of the things it does.

Lemme give some examples why I chose the S8 over many other flagships in the market. \r\n1. Almost all the flagships have AOD. But how many of them don't waste the battery when your phone is inside your pocket or faced down? S8 don't display it when it senses it's inside the pocket. \r\n2. Curved screen has edges and Samsung put edge screen there. Those who never used it will not understand the useability. I don't go inside app menu now a days. It's easy, it's unique and makes people jealous. \r\n3. Samsung is the only manufacturer who provides security like Knox (Secured Folder). You can have your office and home separated now. \r\n4. Most of you guys may say heartrate sensor is a gimmick. But since my Note4, I became more active as I could see my steps and heartrate and that inspired me to workout more. \r\n5. Most of the people always complain about Samsung putting same app twice. But to tell you the truth, I love Samsung Gallery more than Google Photo and it gives me options to edit and do more without another app. Same with the music player and other clone apps. Samsung apps seem to run smoothly on Galaxy devices (the same reason iPhone runs smooth with it's native apps). \r\n6. Samsung always innovates with their things. Yes, it's true that the first time it seems waste, but over the years I find them improving and improvising. Look at edge screen for example. It was nothing when.launched. Now it has definite ease of use. Bixby is waste of space now. But I can assure you it will be amazing in the future. I'll write on Bixby sometime, if I get some time. \r\nI'm not saying other manufacturers are worse. It's just Samsung flagships are worth giving a shot against other flagships. And when you have it, it grows into you. I have used other flagship devices, but after a while it loses it's charms. I don't feel that in Galaxy flagships. Don't even think of buying Samsung midrange devices - they are crap. But with flagship devices (new or old) you will sure discover new things every day. \r\nTake care.

As most of you know, I am a heavy user, my screen stays on almost the whole time unless I am on my bike or I am in a party. Other than that, it is either serving me as a map, or a tracker or a e-book reader or a game console or even a social network manager. And in my office it becomes my personal PC. I remember, the first day my boss saw this phone and was like meh (He uses an iP6s & OP3T). But when I brought my DeX to the office and plugged it in my monitor and started working with it, he was impressed. Sure, it can't do all the things that a PC can do. But for the office works, it sure is on par with the PCs. I even connected a Bluetooth printer for printing my documents. And the fun part is, if I am out of my desk, no one have access on my data as it is always with me. And when I put it back on DeX, bam, it is right where I left it. \r\nSince I brought my DeX in my office, I brought back my wireless charger in my home. S8 can be charged while on DeX. And man, do I need it! But I gotta tell you, I have checked a nd found out my SOT over 4h 30m on every charge, ranging up to 5h 10m. So I am pretty sure that the battery is serving me just fine, considering it has only 3000mAh battery. \r\nI have already posted a details review of my S8, most of those haven't changed yet. So I am not making this comment any longer. But in other areas, my S8 is serving me just great. The only problem I am facing now is that I am unable to find any screen protector that will let me use the Spigen casing that I am using. And I will not use the device without casings, for sure. \r\nOther than that, I am heavily satisfied with my S8. I have heard some people facing problems with their devices, but to be honest, this is the first Samsung device which is giving me service more than I expected from Samsung. \r\nTake care.

Do you really think that I'm stupid and will tell something like that after devices like HTC U11 got released? Pfbhtfht. Stop watching yourself in the mirror and read the comments thoroughly and carefully. \r\nAnd yes, I told that iPhone is prestigious. So is Samsung, Sony and mainstream manufacturers. It's the brand value that companies want to increase. No matter what I say, Apple still has better brand value than Samsung.

But don't say that 3D touch is unnecessary, it's not. If you start using things like 3D touch (by Apple), edge display (by Samsung), floating apps (by Sony), dual screen multitasking (by Android Nougat & Samsung), then how will you understand that they ease your usability? I have a Galaxy Note 12.2 tab which has the ability to show four screens at a time in split screens and up to five floating apps at the same time. Using the tab like that ease up my work. I don't have to switch from app to app, all are in front of me. Similarly, 3D touch helps you to open a particular function of an app without opening the app and click your way to that function. If you have never used those \"gimmicks\", I suggest you do. Then you'll understand that those are NOT GIMMICKS, but actual help on usability. \r\nOnce again, Korea and China are two independent countries and they deserve the respect that they are doing things by their own.

But truly, they are not. Same are you. If you were an engineer, why are you after bacteria again? ROFL. You agreed that the heat is transferred through the heat sink and/or dual pipe coolant. But through what? Does a mobile phone have fan like PC/Laptops do? They don't. So the heat is transferred to the back panel (which is made of glass or Aluminium). That's why when we play heavy games, the back feels warmer than normal usage. \r\nWhen you are talking about numbers and giving reference of two devices' difference in paper, you just can't randomly puck a number, you have to write the fact.

LOL man, LOL. Why don't you enlighten us with a few names, so we'll know which phones you are talking about. We might get some knowledge and become educated like you. \r\nBut then again, it wasn't what you said earlier. You said that S8's glass feels like plastic. Why don't you teach us fools how is it so? Maybe we'll learn something new and start seeing the world in a different angle. \r\nJust mega pixel isn't everything about a camera. First learn about a camera, then come to argue. The sensor plays a major role (we count the mega pixel for the sensor), but the aperture (f-stop), the low light capacity (dual pixels captures more light than single pixel sensors) and the lens quality also matters to get a better picture. That is why DDLRs have separate lenses, to let you get better result from the same camera body. So, when you buy a $200 phone with higher camera resolution, be sure that those phones go nowhere near (at least in the camera section) with a $500+ phone with lower camera resolution. Bring your examples (redmi note4, lenovo makes many models, which one are you talking about?) to compare with phones like Google Pixel, LG G6, Samsung Galaxy S8, Apple iPhone 7+, HTC U11 (any one or all of these, your choice) etc and take pictures and compare them side by side in a computer. You'll see the differences in the noise level, sharpness and clarity of the pictures. And that is where it matters. Any phone can take pictures, it's a good picture that real people want. \r\nNow don't start comparing these phones with DSLRs, they're not as good as them ($800 for just the camera body vs $800 for a phone with camera and lens and everything else). But now a days, any flagship (from any reputed manufacturers) device's camera can defeat any stand alone camera. \r\nCan you count? Sorry, sure you can. Do you know how pixels are calculated? I guess not. Sure, 1440 is merely 33% larger (not 10%. That is why I asked whether you can count or not)  than 1080. But that is NOT how they are calculated. 1920*1080=2073600p and 2560*1440=3686400p, which is almost 78% bigger than FHD or 1080. And fyi, who watches video all the time in a phone? Is watching video the only reason people buy a phone? What about the Internet browsing, social networking and playing games, which btw, supports 1440 with ease. And there are more apps with 1440p resolution (2K) than 1080p resolution (1K). Smart phones are not used for watching movies, but for using different apps and games actually. \r\nOne more thing. In another comment you said, \"to further remind nowadays all phone is waterprooff....heat cannot escape.... even bacteria also cannot go out.....\" - SERIOUSLY? Where did you go to school? I mean, did you ever study Physics 101? For sound to pass, you need the air to pass through as sound travel through air. If phones are sealed off to keep bacteria inside (as per your comment), then the sound will also not pass through. There are tiny vents for speakers in water resistant phones, through which the air can pass, but not the water. That is, btw, enough for heat (and bacteria, if you consider) to pass through. Last time I checked, bacteria didn't grow much bigger than they were last thousand years, ROFL. \r\nAnd yes, one of the duty of the back cover is to pass the heat through. This is why Apple uses Aluminium as the back cover rather than glass as it transfer heat better (better heat conductor). So, heat don't get trapped inside. If it would, it would definitely burn the internal parts of the phone. \r\nAnyway, if you're happy with a $200 phone, that's fine with me. But don't come to argue that a $200 phone can compete with a $500+ phone. People are NOT stupid to spend their money without any reason. Yes, if Xiaomi would make a similar phone like S8, they would cost $400 rather than $800. But you should have heard about the brand value, didn't you? It matters. \r\nSo please, my advice to you is to Google (means, search) things BEFORE you place your arguements and then talk about the facts, not some things that you've dreamt in your mind. It really puts you as a stupid guy in front of us - we don't wanna see you being stupid, we want everyone to be smart. \r\nEveryone take care.

But here are the things that differs it with S8: \r\n1. 3T is a bit larger. The 3T has bigger footprint even though it has smaller screen size (5.5\" vs 5.8\"). For some people it doesn't matter (I know I don't mind a few mm shorter screen). But where S8 shines is that it has slimmer screen, which is a joy to hold. I've used phones like SGN4, which was a phablet and one of the thickest phones around. Using S8 feels great in the hand day to day basis. S8 fans, don't talk about the PPI, please. It really doesn't matter in real life. 90% of the people never even will use the full WQHD+ resolution in S8 than the FHD+. \r\n2. S8 has IP68 rating whereas 3T has none. Maybe it is not important for many, but as I ride my bike regularly, I have the fear of rain pouring on my phone. The water resistance protects my device from going brick. \r\n3. 3T has bigger base memory (64GB/128GB), whereas S8 has only 64GB. But it can be topped up with upto 256GB (theoretically 2TB, but it's not available yet) MicroSD Card. I have put a 200GB inside and still am quite happy with the performance. It didn't slow down, doesn't restart. Those who doesn't need extra memory, 3T is a better option for them. \r\n4. Both the front camera and the rear camera is better than S8, theoretically, that is. Just the Mega Pixel isn't everything. Mega Pixel is the sensor size, how much pixels the sensor has to capture the picture. But the lens and picture processing is also important to get a great picture. The pictures of 3T is very much post-able in social media, where most of the people sees it in a phone's screen anyway. But comparing S8's & 3T's pictures side by side will show you the difference. S8 competes (DXOMarks Score 88) with PixelXL (DXOMarks Score 89) & HTC U11 (DXOMarks Score 90), whereas, 3T is nowhere to be seen in the list down to Score 80. Then again, who uses mobile pictures in a bigger screen now-a-days anyway? For actual photographers there are DSLRs. \r\n5. The BT 5.0 is nothing to frown for if you don't have it. Yes, having it on board is fun. For example, I let my kid play game in the phone while the game sound comes through the device's speaker and I listen to the music through a BT speaker in the other room simultaneously. but living without it is very much possible. \r\n6. The USB port could have been 3.1 or 3.2 in 3T, then it would have been faster in data transfer than the available 2.0 in 3T. \r\n7. Even after the battery being larger than S8, 3T can deliver the same to S8, not higher (refer to the battery test of GSMA and other reviewers). It means, though the battery is larger in 3T (3400mAh vs 3000mAh), the battery management is not good enough to deliver a better result. Same goes for the RAM management. \r\nDefinitely OP3T is a great option to have a look at if you want to buy a phone in the near future. It is cheap, actually half the price of S8, it is good looking. But I have seen manufacturers like MicroMax, like Lava, like Vivo. They were in the market, but where are they now? I don't find their products in the shelves. This is the problem with the Chinese manufacturers. Those cheap models are good, they deliver you a lot more for the value of your money, but don't even serve you much after the sales. On the other hand, look at bigger manufacturers like Apple, Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola etc. Maybe they delay to update, but have a look around and you will find a 3 year old Note 4 is getting updates, iPhone5 getting updates, Sony Xperia ZL (4 years old) getting updates. \r\nIt is not just the device we buy with the price, it is the service that we buy along with the device. Because (I don't know about others, but I can talk for myself) I use a phone for 3-4 years. If it can't serve me for that long, it's worthless to me. \r\nTake care.

I didn't know Note 5 was plagued with battery issues until I read your comment. \n \r\nI am very content with my S5 and see no need to upgrade. After 2 years 7 months, using the original battery that came with the phone, I am still able to get 5 hours on screen time.

If the default browser is the only app open and I'm browsing Facebook I can get up to 10 minutes (possibly even 12) using Wi-Fi before the battery loses a percent. I don't know if I'm one of the lucky persons or the S5 battery is simply exceptional to still deliver good performance after nearly 3 years. \n \r\nCharging is pretty much the same as it was from day one which indicates the battery is healthy. It takes 1hr. 55mins. to charge it from 0-100%, 1hr 15min. to charge it from 50-100% and a fully depleted battery reaches 85% of charge after 1 hour (it use to be 71% with Lollipop then jumped to 85% after upgrading the OS to Marshmallow).\n \r\nAnother thing to note is that my S5 doesn't get hot when charging. A tad bit warm but nowhere near hot like what I hear about other S5 and other Samsung models. For the record I have the G900H which is the Exynos version so maybe that makes a difference where heat is concerned. Does the S8 Exynos or Snapdragon version gets hot while charging?\n \r\nCan somebody please try those three charging methods with their S8 and tell me the difference in charging times compared to the S5. How long does it take to charge the S8 from 0-100%, 50-100% and how much charge does a fully depleted S8 battery reaches after 1 hour of charging.

Android offers a more streamlined option for accessories, but case options and colors are limited by a spintered market share. \r\nAnd 3) How important is camera and imaging to you? \r\nWhile the two phones stack up fairly comparably to one another, editing options are better on the S8 and overall camera build is slightly superior on the iPhone. \r\nAs the older option, the iPhone is likely going to have some cheap contract options now.

If they don't give the updates, then why will people buy it even? On the other hand, Samsung makes more than 10 phones a year, starting from flagships to entry level. And the OS is not their own. After Google releases the updates, they need to customize it to the devices' needs. So yes, iPhone is definitely ahead of Samsung there. \r\nBut wait, the story is not over. I have seen iPhone 5 (32GB) became unusably slow after the update. The reason - lack of storage space after the update. So what's the use of the update if you can't use the phone afterwards? Generally, Androids serve you for two years with updates. Then you are on your own. People who uses Androids are generally tech savvy and they know how to root their devices and go for a custom ROM after the two years period (sometimes even before two years). That keeps the phone running smooth and do not need to wait for the update from the respective manufacturers. My Note 4 was 3 years' old (released in 2014) and got an update on Early January this year. It was still in Marshmallow, but then again, so was SGS7 & SGS7e. Had I have the phone right now, I would either get the update from Samsung or would install a custom ROM along with Android Nougat. \r\nIt depends totally on how much you'll rely on the manufacturer. iPhone users have no other option but to beg to Apple whereas Android users basically shows the middle finger if the manufacturers don't support them enough and install their own OS version and custom ROM and for the next purchase chooses another manufacturer. \r\nI hope I could make you understand clearly.

Please Google it and you'll know what I'm talking about. Not only iPhones, but Androids, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, what not? \r\nAnd do you know that Apple itself has collected and sold user data to companies? They were sued back in 2015 (if I'm not wrong) for this and had to pay the price. iCloud collects and stores your location data along with your synced files, which is very much unnecessary. So does Google (else how does Google know this much?). Yes, iPhone is fast, it's damn fast and absolutely great to use when it's working fine. No other phones can be compared to it. But security? Please. That's a joke on iPhone. Even in my country (Bangladesh) I have seen local shops break the codes and get the iPhones unlocked. It takes only BDT 200 (almost USD 25 only). Yes, they can crack an Android as well. But it takes them almost one hour to do one phone, whereas for an iPhone you can have it back by 10 minutes. One person I know bought a stolen iPhone from these shops for just around USD 80. Wanna sue them? Please come and see for yourself and sue them. That is how the third world countries are running. You can say and believe a lot of things sitting inside your AC room, watching through a clear and sun protected window. But the reality is very different when you walk in the roads. Do you know that the six months old \"new\" phones you buy are mostly stolen phones? Maybe not in your countries, where law is almost perfect, but in the countries where law can be easily broken. There is a huge network and they re-pack the phones and sell it elsewhere. I found my Note 4 in India after 3 months it was stolen. Though I locked it, I'm sure someone took some time to unlock it and re-sell it. And the value they get from selling these phones have share for law enforcement and up to the top parliament members. That is why the third world countries are not doing great. And no, not always they had to sell it as parts, they can sell it as a whole phone by changing one or two parts, which contain the security data. \r\nAnyway, that wasn't the topic. Sorry for bothering you with my frustration. I just said those words to let you know that the zeros and ones you think are safe, are actually the things that you should be avoiding, or at least be careful of. Don't trust these huge companies.

But iFans don't want to accept that. iOS is for doing one thing best - gaming. Android is for doing almost everything better. It's very simple. \r\nOne more thing, iFans don't even wanna admit that the screen of iPhones are NOT made by Apple, the RAM of iPhones are NOT made by Apple, the Camera sensor  of iPhones are NOT made by Apple - yet, these are the things they boast about. Well, I certainly wouldn't just change my wallpaper and call it \"customisation\". I'm no Sammy fan, but definitely an Android fan. I used to laugh at Android when I used Symbian. Back then my Nokia 6600, 6260, 3230, 6680, N70, 3250, N73, N82, E71, E72 and finally N8 could do much more than any Android devices. Sure, Android has come a long way from the 1.6 Eclairs back then. Now it's more polished, more user friendly, more durable and, last but not least, more multitaskable. Whereas Symbian is now Resting in Peace in some graveyard. \r\nAs I see now, Android is going to be on top for a long time. No matter how much Apple or Microsoft tries, they are unable to catch it anytime soon. iOS users are few, that's why hackers don't write virus for iOS. But that doesn't mean that iOS is protected. Just because iOS don't let you share files don't mean that you are secured. Rather it is kinda stupid to me that even in 2017 they didn't figure out how to do that. My bad, whatever Apple says is ALWAYS RIGHT. Like they said how \"backdated\" the headphone jack is! ROFL. \r\nAnyway, the final thing is, I love Android, but that doesn't mean I hate iOS or Windows or Ubuntu or any other OS out there. Every OS has their flaws. If you're normal user, but want to take control of your device, go for Android. If you want to take ABSOLUTELY EVERY CONTROL with being a nerd (read, genius - just not the Apple one), go for Ubuntu. But if you are unable to understand what does what and are happy that besides calling and texting your phone can play you music and show you some videos and (oh, how can I forget) play games fluently, but let you change ONLY the wallpaper in the name of being customization, sure, go for iOS. \r\nPlease don't take it negatively.

The following are my findings: \r\n1. If you ever mention slightly that you MIGHT even think of buying an Android device, specially Samsung, they will start screaming at you. I've found people asking \"iP7 or S8?\" The result was, well, you can guess. \r\n2. No iFans are logged in into their account. They all post in Anonymous. There can be a few reasons behind it - a) iPhones don't let them log in (like it don't let them share over BT. b) They really are not iPhone users. They are paid to create hypes over iPhone. Else they would log in and people could track them back and see whether they really use iPhones or not. c) They don't own an iPhone, just became iFans after reading the specs. \r\nI have a colleague who is a die hard iFan. He never used one, until recently, but always would find time to tell me how good iPhone is. Recently he bought an iP7 & now he is not happy because the battery doesn't stay longer and can't share anything over the BT. \r\n3. iFans hate the fact that Androids have much higher resolution. iPs never had over 1K display, so they keep no stones unturned to try to prove that higher resolution is a gimmick. \r\n4. At the end of almost every discussion they say \"iP is faster than any Androids\" (they really are) or \"A10 is the best processor in the world\" - if fast is EVERYTHING, then iPs are great. But unfortunately being fast doesn't mean much, at least to me. And, if A10 would be the best processor, why don't they use it in MacBooks? \r\nI'm NOT saying that iPs are worse. But it's not enough. I mean, the games run best in iOS, because the games are optimized for THAT resolutions only. Whereas in Android world, every phones have different resolutions and apps (and games) have tough time to match the resolution. That is why the games don't run perfectly on Android devices. Yes, if you want to play games, you MUST get iPhone for that. But if you want productivity, iPhones don't support much there. It should be your choice, your goal on what you want - Playing games or doing work. iPhone is definitely the best media house whereas Androids are powerful working tools. \r\nTake care.

But I have to warn you that you'll be disappointed with the battery as it is no where near the Note 4. But there is fast charge, so it'll help you on that issue. The security is much strong in S8 & S8+. The second batch (after the pre orders) should be on the way to the shelves by now. So go and hold one in the shops and see for yourself whether you can go on with it or not. I can only say that I'm 100% happy with my S8. But that doesn't mean that you will be happy as well.

Ciao...", "date": "16 May 2017"}, {"text": "So, it's been a week with my new Samsung Galaxy S8 & as promised, here is my pure user review. \r\nThe screen of the S8 is amazing, I mean, simply amazing. I keep on staring at it all day long. Luckily my phone doesn't have any red tint issue or restart issue. I'm loving every moment with it. It's fluent and fast. Those who are complaining about Samsung's laggy TouchWiz should use this phone for a while. It's totally new and swift, doesn't lag anymore, but stammers sometimes (there is a difference between lagging and stammering). Will it lag in the future? Well, that's only time can tell. For now, it's better than previous generations. \r\nI've got a theory on this. My last Samsung product was a Note 4 from 2014. At that time Android couldn't do multitasking in split screen, couldn't do floating apps, couldn't do a lot of things that my Note 4 could do. To enable them Samsung had to go through a lot of skinning. But now Android itself can do all those things, so Samsung could make S8 lighter than before. That's why the UI is so light this time around. \r\nYes, when you press the Bixby button, it waits for a while (why, I don't know). Other than that, all my commands are executed perfectly. I downloaded some benchmark apps and my device's score is mostly higher than that of the review devices in the published review units around the word. \r\nBtw, I don't know why they have put the Bixby button there without finalizing it properly. Though I've never \"accidentally\" pressed it, sometimes it annoys me that there is a button and I can't use it properly. Yeah, I know thay I can remap it with apps, but I was talking about using Bixby, not something else. \r\nThe battery is not as good as I expected. It's not giving me a whole day service. Then again, I come from Note 4 and nothing can compete Samsung's Note series there. But it may also because I keep watching YouTube, browse net, play games like Temple Run 2, Flight Pilot or Robbery Bob 2, listening to music, and obviously, taking notes and doing office works in it. But the fast charge and the wireless charger on my office desk covers me there. So I think I'm good for the time being. \r\nI am used to with a 12.2\" screen with four part split screen (Note Pro did spoil me there), so I don't find the split screen unusable. And on top of that, the floating apps does come in handy in times. The edge screen is very useful and only those who never ever used it will call it a gimmick. The keyboard is good, very easy to type or swipe. I'm using it now to write the user review, btw. \r\nThe download speed is great, so is the upload speed. I find my S8 grabbing all the Wi-Fi data in my home and other devices those are connected in my home have to put on a fighr to get a chance for the net. \r\nWhat I hate about the phone is that it's a fingerprint magnet. I can't keep it open to show off the back. I had to put it in a case to protect it from fingerprints and scratches (did I forget to tell you that S8 is much more fragile than other phones out there? But as I'm a grown up and matured person, I don't drop my phone. I take a good care of it. It's your own carefulness that will keep your phone broken or intact.) \r\nThe cameras are pretty good. They are on par with iP7+, LGG6, GPixel etc. The front camera is great. But I find the faces turned out softened. No matter how much \"beauty face\" I turn down, it still \"smoothen\" my face. The 3D view is one thing I'm crazy about, though I'm unable to publish it like a 360 cam in social sites. Oh, I love to take videos of the fishes in the aquarium (and my friends are jealous of that). \r\nAs I told earlier, I don't have any problem with the fingerprint scanner on the back. Yeah, it's placed oddly, but I checked it before buying and I don't hate it (neither am I a fan of the placement) I don't use face unlock. Instead, I use iris scanner. The more I use it, the snappier it becomes. It opens everything in a mere fraction of a second. And it works perfectly in the dark too. Only in the morning it asks me to open my eyes more, LOL. \r\nI don't use Bixby, neither did I stop it from working. I just talk with Google Assistant instead, that's it. \r\nThe sound quality is loud & good enough through the speaker and the headphone. Both are clear, to the least. \r\nI love the BT5.0, as I can connect my wife's BT Headset along with mine while we watch the TV series together. Again, I listen to music in BT speaker while my son plays Temple Run 2 in the phone, both hearing different audio. \r\nThe DeX attachment is so-so. It is not as good as using a PC, but with time it might become better in the next generations. \r\nYeah, till now S8 is snappy, but I can't promise that it'll be the same after a year or so (if we follow Samsung's trend). But for now, it's an awesome device & a very good purchase. Yes, there are some devices which are on par with the performance of S8, but may or may not match the cost. But for me, S8 serves me the most for my bucks. It may be not the case for everyone, but as for me, it's the best I can get. It feels great in the hand, just perfect for my palm. But it may not be the same for everyone. \r\nS8 have some flaws, it's not perfect in any sense. But it's not an ugly or slow or crap device either. Those who are saying that have never hold one in the hand. The main reason behind my purchase of S8 is the looks. It stands out in the crowd of flagships. All my colleagues at one point or another took my S8 and played with it for a while. Everyday at least once I'm asked, \"Is that the S8?\" or \"What's that phone in your hand?\" \r\nPeople does buy an iPhone for prestige. It has it's brand value. In the phone world it might be the RollsRoyce, being the standard of prestige. The Sony might be the Lamborghini, whatever the looks is, it's powerful. But you have to admit that the Samsung is the Audi and S8 is the Audi R8, sexy looks with attitude and delivers the power when needed. You might not agree with me, but hey, that's what I think, that's only my own perspective. \r\nTake care.

My only request to all users of S8/S8+ is that they should also check their handset too on the Samsung Fast Wireless Charger that while charging wirelessly is it showing 'Fast Wireless Charging' or it displays only 'Wireless Charging' which is also showing on my S8 too.   \r\nBy investigating this we can inform the SAMSUNG team to take this matter seriously and on priority and try to resolve it or otherwise, they should accept that they made this default change in their S8/S8+ phone that its Fast Wireless Charging is being disabled and it will only charge at regular Wireless Charging, not like Note 5, S7 and S7 Edge smartphone.", "date": "12 May 2017"}, {"text": "Im a samsung fan", "date": "12 May 2017"}, {"text": "2 millions product aint no joke boy", "date": "12 May 2017"}, {"text": "still don't get why samsung only put Quick Charge 2.0 whilst Snap835 already supported QC 4.0 its damn slow for a expensive phone to charging 10% to 100% for about 2 hours. \n \r\nBelieve if it was QC 4.0 you only need about 70 mins from 10% to full charged or even quicker", "date": "12 May 2017"}, {"text": "Be Careful when you're grabbed it or holding it dude.. it's looks like very risky if a phone with full glass body back and front, but their maximize the design of a phone combined with metal color inside of it, so...

You have to manually upgrade it to higher resolution. \r\nI know that not everyone is like me. That's why I never said (or will say) something else is bad and something is good. I always say, it's your money, your choice. Choose wisely so that the device serves you better than other devices within your budget. \r\nMaybe I was wrong about the iris scanner.

You trolls are after something silly like red tint and are blabbering like some goats all over the place. \r\nEven Apple put dangerous disclaimers in their official disclaimer page. For example, iPhone 7/7+ is water resistant to the grade of IP67. Very good. But if you dunk one in the water and then try to charge it immediately, the device will fry. And funny thing is, Apple did the disclaimer about that in the page. And the warranty don't even cover it.

Please do the homework. \r\nAnyway, for me S8 it is. My phone is going to be in my hand soon and I'm gonna love using it because it gives me those things that I love, not those things that people love. At the end of the day, it all depends on the user. Else companies like Symphony and MicroMax wouldn't be able to sell. \r\nSo, whichever you choose - G6, S8 or even iP7/7+, be happy with it.

In case you didn't know, Ford was the first one to build a car. \r\nI remember, back in 2014, my wife's Asus tab didn't have a home button and it would vibrate when you would press the virtual home button. I guess Apple copied from Asus, right? \r\nAnd now, here is a line I am copying from your given link: \"In one of our many posts on Wednesday covering Samsung's big announcements, we commented on how annoying it was that Apple fans were accusing Samsung of copying Apple's naming scheme by calling its phablet the \"Galaxy S8 Plus.\" Last time we checked, 2014 came after 2011, which is when Samsung released its first smartphone with \"Plus\" in the name. \" \r\nIt seems like I'm not the only one getting annoyed with lame and stupid accusations. If you can, find out real flaws that S8 has (and I can assure you, this device has some flaws, but I won't tell you, you need to stop being lazy and find it out yourself, LOL). Use your brain and say those, for we are starting to doubt on your IQ level out here. \r\nTake care.

That's why genuine reviewers take a week or two to review the device to get the hang out of them before they can get the real usage values. \r\nBtw, check whether your screen on time is 4hr 30min to 5hr+.

Why don't you please go through it and find out how fragile iPhone 7 is comparing to S8. Here it goes. Please, do enjoy.\n  \r\nThe reason gorilla glass 5 cracks is because they are not fragile proof, but shatter proof. If you don't know the differences, I suggest you open a dictionary or google it. It's like not understanding the differences between water proof and water resistance. LOL. One thing for sure, you never failed me to laugh. Stop doing it, I might pee. \r\nThe face recognition is one thing you are right. But just a few flaw don't make a device fail. Do they? I should then ask you to send me a file over bluetioth or change your settings through the NFC or change a theme on your phone. I am 100% sure that you'll not be able to do any of them. Does it then make iPhone a failure? You tell me. \r\nNaming S8 Plus is copying from iPhone? Since when? When did Apple put a Copyright law against using the Plus name? Isn't it just another biased iD-iOt screaming in a lame excuse? I think so. I believe others will also say so. \r\nAlso, iPhone not having a home button doesn't mean that S8 copied from it. A lot of devices these days don't have home buttons and that too from long before iPhone 7 was launched. Another lame scream I heard there. If that's not the case, woukd you agree that if Note 8 has fingerprint scanner inside the screen and iPhone 8 or whatever has the same (which will come later this year or early next year), Apple will be hold responsible and will be pointed at for copying it from Samsung? I remember other phones having cameras and MP3 player installed before the very first iPhone. Did Apple copy them?? Heck, even the dual camera is not iPhone's originality. So, did they copy? Cat got your tongue? \r\nFor the answer of your third link, please follow my first link and the answer again. \r\nOne thing for sure, you made a point out here. I always thought five points mean 5 points. I remember a joke after reading your comment. Please feel free to read if you're not lazy. \r\nA teacher asked a student to give and example of an amphibian. A frog, he answered. The teacher asked, Can you give another example? The boy answered, another frog. \r\nYour complaints against the S8 seemed the same to me, broken glass, copying iPhone and broken galss - these are your three points.

Are you willing to pay that much for this phone? It's your call. \r\nBut let me tell you something. I lost my Note 4 last January and since then I've been tracking this device (rumored at that time). I liked what was coming forward. Finally it was launched at it was the best looking phone in the market (absolutely my opinion only). But comparing to other phones it wasn't much to provide. Yes, it has bigger and better screen, has a great screen to body ratio, a unique design. BUT it has the same performance even after the upgrade of the processor. Yes, the RAM management and the UI is better now, but it's the same old. The S7 & S7e has the same performance like S8 & S8+. The camera is just upgraded through software (though they changed the hardware with similar, not the same, sensor). It's basically the same old Galaxy S series inside. \r\nNow, I have played with S7e (as S7 is unavailable in the markets in our country). I found that S7e is good, but what stopped me from buying it was the palm rejection of the curved screen. Whenever I held the phone, the screen was either unresponsive or opening apps by itself that I don't want to open. So if you consider the daily usage, it would definitely hurt your usage. \r\nHad I have my Note 4 with me now, I wouldn't think about buying an S7e or S8. But as that's not the case and I'm using an S4 mini (or my Note 12.2, which is very tough to carry as a phone, LOL) for the time being (even though the screen of the S4 mini is hard to read after using a bigger screen phone like Note 4 for such a long time), I feel that I need a phone with a bigger screen. S7e was rejected for the palm rejection failure. S8 is a uniquely designed phone, so I thought, why not? \r\nNow, about the price. It's costing me around 950USD in my country. But with the pre booking they are going to provide me DeX (with the fast charging), which costs around 160USD. Again, the shop I'm buying from, they are going to provide me a 128GB MicroSD card for free, which would cost me 100USD. So, deducting those we get 690USD, which, in my book is very cheap, considering that if I want to buy an S7e, it will cost me around 720USD at present in my country. But had S8 been 900USD and above (which is the case now, that the pre booking is over), I wouldn't definitely buy it. To me, the phone is costing 690USD only (though I am paying much more, but getting all the value returned). \r\nThat was my case. Now you think about it yourself. Are you willing to spend this much money or not. If you have the cash, go to the shops and hold it for yourself. I was attached to it when I first held it in my hands. It felt amazing. You can see that the screen is so big, which makes you believe that you won't be able to reach to the farthest corners, but I could, and I'm talking about S8, NOT S8+. I always wanted to have a curved screen since Note edge (which was a variant of my Note 4, but at that time edge panel was not refined like now, but more like a show off). \r\nIt's your call now. I hope I have cleared the roads for your thoughts. I don't know you personally, so I don't know what you want and/or need. It's you who will have to understand it and buy accordingly. If not the S8, there are plenty of options around - LGG6, iP7 & iP7+, Oppo3T, HTCU and the list goes on. You go to your nearby shops and see what you can find at what price. Then look here in GSMarena and compare the specifications and go through the reviews. Then you will have an idea which one of the phones you want. Then make your call. \r\nHave fun.

Now, if you please back up your words, particularly on S8 (or S8+) \r\n1. being a flop worldwide \r\n2. battery draining fast \r\n3. being ugly \r\nThere is numerous videos on YouTube that shows how S8 is winning on battery test against other flagship phones. I'm not particularly taking any names to avoid conflicts. But why don't you do a search and find it out yourself if you're not lazy. \r\nWhat about the other points I made? You seem like avoiding them on purpose. I was so looking forward that you'd try to confront me.on them, but glad.to.know that you've come to your senses. \r\nIf you do a search you'll find out that not only in US (the link was just an example), but in Korea, in India they have also broke the previous records. On the rest of the world they are on par. \r\nIf you follow the tech world, you'll know that Samsung is not doing good on TVs, LG & Sony is the king there, fridge, washing machine, AC and other gadgets are the same for Samsung. They are doing okay on other segments, but in mobile devices, they are doing excellent. \r\nAt least know what's going on around before making such bold comments. Else your comments become nothing else but a laughing stock. \r\nHave a good time with your iPhone. An iPhone is ONLY good if you use it with the Apple environment (iPaf, Macbook, iWatch etc). In Android world you can get the things that you see fit. I used my LG Watch Urbane with a Note 4 and Note 12.2 Tab with a Dell XPS. I don't like to be controlled and compelled to stick to one environment for using my things to the fullest. That's why I'm against using the Apple product. All my gadgets work in perfect syncronization even without being manufactured by one company. \r\nFinally, if you're happy with your iPhone, why are you wasting your precious time in an s8 forum? The answer is, you're not satisfied. Be satisfied, or stop pretending to be satisfied and have the thing that satisfies you. Take care.

However, I do have to point out that the wireless charger is quite pointless to be honest. The whole point of it being that you can charge your phone on the go anywhere you are in the house. What I'm trying to say here is that the only benefit of the 'wireless' charger is that you don't have to connect the wire to you phone. You still have to dock your phone and can't use it in the mean time. It would've at least been satisfactory if it was more of a wireless power-bank, which you can carry around anywhere and charge your phone when you need to. Even with the wireless charger you have look for power sockets. And your IR sensor comparison isn't quite valid if you think about it. The remote controller works from wherever you are standing, you don't have to take the remote and make contact with the IR sensor to make it work (it would still be 'wireless'). I hope you get what I am saying.  \r\nI would just like to point out that I am not bashing any company or product. I just felt like you comment wasn't quite accurate so just pointed that out.

At that time, the controller needed to be connected with a 25ft long cable with the VCR. The benefit was that you could control it from a distance. \r\nIn late 90's I started seeing pure remote controls with IR control. These controllers didn't have any wires. I guess you don't know how they work. The remote sends signal via IR to the sensor, which is connected in the device with wire. \r\nSo, by your definition, we shouldn't call them wireless remotes as the wire connects the sensors in the device, right? Really? (Surprised emo here) \r\nWell, a wireless charger works the same way. The charger is connected through the wire while the phone gets thw benefit of being wireless.

That's a lie my friend. Even a country like Bangladesh has demo units available. By your name I guess you are from Russia or countries beside Russia.

If you can't prove me wrong in at least five points, put your mouth shut, please, as you have lost the truth and dare. \r\nYours truly \r\nAndroid lover (iOS disliker, but iD-iOts hater)", "date": "30 Apr 2017"}, {"text": "Dear Mr. (Un)biased, your words don't fit with your claim, so please change it. \r\nI can see at the beginning you started with naming Samsung as a shiny stone while claiming iPhone as Diamond. That's very much BIASED. Again, you screamed like a baby about wireless-charging and why-we-don't-need-it $h!t. For your info, the iPhone 8 IS 90% confirmed to have a glass back to have the built-in option for wireless-charging. I am waiting for you now to say that you DON'T need wireless-charging, one more time, just one more time, oh, pretty please. See, that's NOT unbiased. The moment iPhone removed the headphone jack and others still have it, I heard iD-iOts started screaming about how headphone jacks don't matter and how they are so old and blah blah blah. But before that their claim was on THAT VERY headphone jack and the BEST HEADPHONES that Apple provided with the device. WOW! Bunch of hypocrites. \r\nLast night I was watching Flossy Carter's \"S8 Real Review\" in YouTube. If you don't know this channel, go and search for it, everyone should love this guy. He never takes bribe from any companies and he buys the retail phones with his own money (and before you ask, he is very rich, that's how he manages to buy all the devices) and finally gives a L-O-N-G review of the device(s). Last night he reviewed S8 & S8+. His \"things I don't like\" list was long, so was his \"things I like\" list. \r\nBack to the original story. His brother is iFan. at one point Floss showed him the Iris scanner in the S8, he was amazed, but didn't wanna lose to Floss and said, \"Does it work in the dark?\" So they moved in the pitch black trunk of the car and tried it and BOOM, it worked! His brother was speechless. Finally what he said was, \"Well, it's a gimmick, nobody needs an Iris scanner.\" I can find similarities with our friend Mr. (Un)biased here. \r\nAgain, when Apple launched Siri, everyone said it was a gimmick and nobody needs it. But then look around now. Even Samsung is trying to work themselves in the game with Bixby. What will happen to Bixby, only time will tell. But I'm curious to find out what our iFriends out there say when iPhone 8 (or whatever the name will be) will have the wireless-charging on board. I know, I know, till iPhone gets it, it's always a gimmick. Silly me! Phbfhbfhfhff. \r\nAnd if Smartphones were all about just basic needs, then they wouldn't be called \"SMARTPHONES\", or would they? I guess the word smartphone is a gimmick as well as iPhones never could became one yet, truly. Just like curved screens are gimmicks now as Apple seriously failed to do so in the upcoming iPhone, and the fingerprint scanner inside the screen is a gimmick as iPhone isn't gonna have it while Note 8 will have it, thanks to Synaptics. And before you ask, Apple has a great (NOT) relation with companies like Synaptics, so they won't build them what they want, LOL. That friendly (?!?) attitude from Apple and it's fans, so popular. But if they somehow manage to put the fingerprint scanner inside the screen by themselves, that would be like \"Apple did it first again, they have yet set a trend, yay!\" WOW! But guess what, Note 8 will launch before iPhone whatever. \r\niPhones have NFC, but it's use is limited, has bluetooth option, but for connecting a headset only, you can't share files over bluetooth. For that you don't need more than BT v1.2, do you? You can't connect your iPhone with a PC (or Mac) which doesn't have iTunes installed and use it as a thumb-drive (pen-drive). Dude, it's 2017 already, NOT the year 2000. And again, your home Mac, your office Mac and your phone will have the same number of same songs in each devices in the name of Sync. You can't choose which to sync. And the list goes on and on. So please, think of your own problems before criticizing others. There is a proverb, \"Grapes are sour\". If you don't know the moral of the story, well, my bad. If you were so intelligent, you wouldn't be what you are, right? My bad. Sorry, my bad! \r\nAnd if someone says anything, I mean ANYTHING better than iPhone, they keep on going, \"You are paid to say so\". Well, it proves that they also know iPhones has nothing better inside, just the shell, but yet it sells. How they sell it? By paying people to say good about iPhones. And that's how they think everything works, pays to talk. Well, I don't feel like correcting you guys anymore. You are worthless, beyond my speeches. \r\nYou know something? As Apple says, I should say it in my own words, \"You wanted to be iD-iOts, you just don't know it yet\". \r\nSmart ones, take care.

By that standard, our S8 unit managed an average deltaE of 2 and a maximum one of 3.2, using the AMOLED Basic mode. \r\nThe S8 has a total of four selectable screen modes, each with its own gamut specifics. If you really want to get technical about it, AMOLED Cinema is very accurate as per the DCI-P3 color gamut. AMOLED Photo is what you want to come as close to Adobe RGB as possible and Basic Screen mode aims towards sRGB or Rec. 709. The latter is usually what consumer digital cameras, TVs, laptops and other tech aim for, so it could be a familiar sight, if you spend a lot of time in front of other screens.\" \r\nWhat it says clearly that S8 screens are one of the best screens available.

Still the iD-iOts are trying to troll on others as they can't contain their jealousy. \r\nFinally, half eaten is so threatened by S8 & S8+ that they knows if they don't go beyond S8 duos, they will fall on the ground. It'll be proved in front of everyone that it's not worth anymore. Samsung makes more than one design in a year and can take it if one fails. But one spec-iAl company makes only one design a year (two recently) and even after that if they fail, they'll be known as losers. I'm sorry, the correct spelling should be iLosers then. \r\nI don't like to go on conflicts. I love to believe whatever you like is your own choice. But I had no other options but to say these as some iD-iOts started to cross the line over here. If you hate S8 so much, then why are you here in this S8 page? Why don't you go to your own page to love it? We want to hear constructive reviews here, not bashing S8. If there is a real problem, we are ready to hear constructive reviews.

I think the reason your phone is heating up is because of the aging device. As the phone got updates over time, and as the earlier files are never deleted (ROM = Read Only Memory, which have the first loaded OS, ICS 4.0.4 in your case), the memory have started to slow down. It's normal. Even the best phones will do the same. In present time, a phones lifespan is considered two years, where you have already went for almost five years with it. \r\nBut have you checked the S8+ yourself? I know it has a bigger screen and all, but did you hold it in your hand? I did, and it didn't feel good to me (even when I used to have a Note 4 before). Specially, the reason that the fingerprint scanner on the back wasn't easily reachable, I switched to S8 instead. But hope you have made the right choice. My one hour time with the S8 & S8+ was way too good. After that one hour I even made a video of S8. I would give the link, but it is in my native language, so you wouldn't understand. \r\nAnyway, wish you all the best. Btw, when is your phone coming to you?

After the page loads, in the \"compare\" section, type Galaxy S8+ and hit \"Enter\". Then let the page reload. After that, go to the next \"compare\" section and type Galaxy s7 edge and hit \"Enter\". The result will show you comparisons of the three phones. That should give you the idea of which is what. \r\nBut if you ask me, the following are the plus points for S8 & S8+ over S7e: \r\n1. Bigger screen (6.2\"(S8+) VS 5.5\" OR 5.8\"(S8) VS 5.5\") - S8+ is much bigger, while S8 is about the same size as S7e \r\n2. Newer Chipset (Snapdragon 835 VS Snapdragon 820 OR Exynos 8895 VS Exynos 8890 - 10nm VS 14 nm) - S8 & S8+ are better \r\n3. Screen comes with better \"palm rejection\" than S7e \r\n4. Lighter touchwiz (now called Samsung Experience) \r\n5. Better onboard storage (64GB VS 32 GB) \r\n6. Has Iris Scanner now (S7e don't) \r\n7. Fingerprint Scanner is in an awkward position. But it is tough to reach it on S8+, easy on the S8, even for smaller hands (Those who complain about the Fingerprint scanner unreachability on S8 may have puny hands) \r\nAnd the followings are the plus points of S7e over the other two: \r\n1. Being the last years flagship it is much cheaper than it was (actually half of it's initial release) \r\n2. The camera on S7e is not far behind of S8 & S8+ \r\n3. The battery of S7e is better than S8 & S8+ (3600mAh VS 3000mAh & 3500mAh) \r\n4. Still a good looking phone \r\n5. Has the same IP68 rating and the option to top the storage upto 256GB (that is the highest available until now) \r\nSo the decision is yours now. But one thing I must add, being the newer, S8 & S8+ will have more upgrades than S7e. But that is not an issue if you do a custom ROM. In my opinion, S8 is the better choice of the three as it is still very compact and you get the best of both worlds. And frankly speaking, it is the best looking phone out in the market now, hands down. But as usual, you may consider about phone lag after a year. To avoid that you should restart your phone at least once a week, once a day if you can. and keep your phones internal memories free by avoiding installing apps that you don't use. I'm using a Note Pro 12.2 for almost 3 years now and it is serving me the same as it did when I bought it. Mind you, the Samsung UI was cR@p back then.

As I've said earlier (and I'll stick to that), No single phone model can kill another company. What kills a company are: \r\n1. Lack of innovation (example: HTC) \r\n2. Listening to the POV of the users (again, HTC) \r\n3. Same old design (though Apple actually set a trend there and to be honest, it's working pretty well for them) \r\nBut in my opinion you can kill a company if you can put a mole inside the company (what Samsung did to Nokia). That way, you leave your perfect things and head for the worse. \r\nEven if Apple fails to put fingerprint scanner on the screen, even if they can't make the edge screen on the special iPhone, it'll still live. You wanna know why? Because, you agree or not, iPhone is the snappiest of all. It may not look S E X Y, but it IS the fastest phone around. If you take out ALL the customization options from Android, it'll become fast as well. But as that's not gonna happen, it is as it is. There will always be people looking for deep customization and not at all. There will always be people for amazing new design and same-old-boring design. Everyone should respect other's choice. Think about it, you really don't want everyone to like what you like. If that would happen, all the boys would run after a single girl and all the girls would run after a single boy. Thanks to Almighty that's not the case. So everyone, chill. \r\nIn here people expect the hands-on user experience review, not \"my phone can do this and yours cannot\".

I believe iPhone8/iPhone Apple Edition (whatever they name it) will have it's own place and nobody will be able to take it. I personally think the fingerprint scanner on Sony phones are also placed in a stupid place (on the side). Stupid because everyone can guess that the right thumb is the only finger to reach there comfortably. But hey, if the user is happy, who am I to speak? The only reason I ordered an S8 over S8+ is because of the fingerprint scanner. I tried it, and I know personally that it's not hard (if not very easy) to reach it behind in an awkward place. Every phone ever made has their drawbacks, there is NO PERFECT PHONE in the world. And believe me, no one want to make one as it will be near impossible for the next generation of the device to follow the trend of perfection (go through marketing 101 books to learn more). Sure, one company will always want to kill another company, but if you think it can be done by just one phone, well, phfbfbfbb. \r\nPersonally I don't like iPhones because the lack of personalisation, but  iPhone shines where others cannot, sheer performance. Well, I don't care if my phone opens a second later (and a few more in games, but I don't waste my time on mobile gaming, I have my gaming console for that), so I think I choose personalisation over performance. Those who want their phone faster, they choose iPhone. Those who want Jack-of-all, goes for the Android. As simple as that. Then why is the \"my phone is better than yours\" $h!t? Cool, man.

If you don't believe me, you can go and do some homework on the topics. \r\n1. Anonymous said, \"resolution of screen is set low by default I guess on purpose to save battery and as soon as you enable high resolution a warning pops up about higher battery usage\" - well, almost every phone that are updated to Nougat or coming with Nougat (specially those which have QHD resolution), can change screen resolution by Android default. And those who can change, are set to FHD by default. Check LG G6 if you don't believe me. Even that came with the FHD resolution by default and shows the battery usage warning if you want to upgrade the resolution to QHD. \r\n2. Peteraven said, \"i bought galaxy A3 after one year screen start to flicking. After these experiences with samsung phones I tell you that I will never own a Samsung product anymore\" - If you compare a flagship with a mid range phone, that's a pity. Because you have no idea about any phone and you are just babbling. I can get you below 100USD Android phones (definitely Chinese made), they will be good in the shop, but as soon as you start to put a few apps inside, they will slow down, lose their performance as they don't have neither the RAM, ROM nor the processing power. You can't really compare it with high end flagships, can you? SA3 is a mid range phone at best. And I've used Samsung mid rangers, believe me, they are more crappy than those Chinese phones. \r\n3. LoL said, \"Seriously some of smartphone already come out with 6000mAh in cheaper price. Android this day all about battery life\" - Please show me a flagship that has thin waist and a battery like 6000mAh. Flagships are more like show off and they seldom go beyond 3500mAh. Only a few of them is on the 4000mAh mark. I have a phone that has 6500mAh, but it's a basic phone and it stays STRAIGHT TWO MONTHS without charging. If battery life is all you care, go for basic phones. And please, don't come and tell me about RAM. iPhone has 2GB RAM but runs fast. It's all about RAM management. The phones that has more RAM, usually is unable to manage the RAM. It's the fault in the coding of that particular company IT department. \r\n4. Mohsen85 said, \"Only xperia xz premium 6544 geekbench 4k hdr Speaker stereo Camera 960 f Better price High build quality\" - Well, I honor your choice. But why Xperia XZ didn't win my choice are as follows: Same old bulky box design (my 5 year old Xperia ZL has the same looks, only plasticy instead of glassy). XZ uses the 4K screen ONLY WHEN a 4K content is viewed in the video. Else, it uses the display as same 2K (AKA QHD) as other flagship phones. 960fps is a superb function, no doubt. But it is \"a bit more like hit and miss\" (quoted from Android Authority in YouTube). If you fail to push the button on the right time (human timing error), then the 1/16 second 960fps SlowMo is not going to serve your purpose. If it would record at least 5sec SlowMo, I would DEFINITELY go for XZ this year, no matter how boring the same-old-same-old design looks. But that is NOT the case in reality. But if someone likes it, then it IS a good phone. Heck, there are people who loves iPhone (without the headphone jack and wireless charging in this future age). But I honor their choice. It's just not for me (and some other people, we are basically stupidly, deeply, madly in love with Samsung, right?), but a lot of people likes what I like. Sometimes the mass can be wrong as well. \r\n5. Hephaestus8 said, \"Its not even in the market yet isnt it. I heard it will release around June\" - No, you're wrong. SGS8 & SGS8+ is going to be on shelves tomorrow (April 21, 2017) worldwide, specially in USA & Korea. In Bangladesh we will get it on May 8, 2017. And I wouldn't say XZ an obsolute phone. THAT has it's own market share as many people like many different things. Just because it didn't serve my purpose shouldn't mean that it won't serve someone else's. \r\nThat's all for now.

But no doubt, it is one of the top feature rich, as well as one of the best looking phones out there. With time Android phones gets slow, we all know that, iPhone doesn't - even that's true (but iPhone slows down with updates). But you don't judge something for things yet to happen. \r\nI have a senior alumni who was a fan of iPhones. He started from iP3G, later bought iP4s, then iP5. Last year he wanted to buy iP6 or iP7, whichever he could manage. I asked him to try out the older SGN5 (SGN7 was out then) with the promise that if he didn't like it, I would buy it from him with full amount that he bought, even if the phone had scratches or any other problems. Long story short, I offered him iP7 for his SGN5 last night, he declined with a devilish grin. That is how I can tell you how Samsung is better than other phones. The reason Samsung is doing so well despite of being slow is because it's so feature rich. Well, there are people who don't like such feature rich phones. Even for them there are Google Pixel and Motorola phones. But as for me, I love different features that separates me from the crowd. Someone below commented me something like \"Go and buy this phone if you are so in love with it\". Well, in Bangladesh it is almost 950USD in pre-order (along with the DeX though) and I have already pre-ordered my SGS8 which I hope to have in my hand by the second week of coming May. \r\nI understand that not everybody wants to customize their phones, so not all phones are good for them. If I don't do customization at all, what is the use of using Android even? But that doesn't (and shouldn't) mean that iOS is bad. I don't understand why iOS fans hit on Android fans and vice-versa? Why can't it be like \"Yes, the phone you're talking about is good, but it's not my type\" or \"Good phone, but need to improve on this and that.\" Why is it always trying to bash others? No matter how much nonsense you speak or write here, to me SGS8 is the best phone around right now. But that's for me and me only. It's MY opinion. Why can't you guys take that as a USER OPINION and continue a friendly relationship in the forum? \r\nI hope other phone users who come here and read the comments will be sober enough to not to start a fight or argue.

Ciao...", "date": "18 Apr 2017"}, {"text": "The 12MP camera from last year's SGS7, SGS7e & SGN7 were one of the best (if not the best) mobile phone cameras around. After the last year's problem with SGN7, the company faced huge loss. People were looking forward for the Note 7, but had to choose a different device instead. And in the phone market, it's not unlikely to move away from one company to another. So Samsung faced a huge loss there. \r\nThis year, the release of SGS8 & SGS8+ was huge for Samsung. If they make any mistake, they will be gone from the number one position. So they are playing very careful. If you have followed the tech world for the last three months, you will know that Samsung has promoted on how they are checking the battery on eight levels to avoid any mishaps. This is to build trust among the users. That is why Samsung wanted to create a full screen phone, a phone that was supposed to be marketed a few years later. But to make that happen they needed to make sure that the camera is not worse than last year. We all know that SGS7 & SGS7e had one of the best cameras of last year. So they changed the module, but kept the resolution same (so that the algorithm behind the sensor can be the same, at least) and worked on the software (but not much). They just made sure that the low-light performance is at least a bit better from last year, which they did ensure (somewhat). That's why SGS7 & SGS8 has the camera of the same resolution, but NOT the same units. \r\nOn a side note, Samsung wanted to make the All-Screen phone later, not this year. But to pull the consumers toward them, they had to move forth with the idea sooner than they expected. That is why Synaptics didn't get the chance to finish the work on the Screen Fingerprint Scanner and Samsung had to put the Fingerprint Scanner somewhere. The front of the phone had no place and the back of the phone has battery on the middle. My best guess is that SGS8 was supposed to have a dual sensor camera and they had the place freed up for the Fingerprint Scanner (don't judge me for the guess, it might be wrong). But whatever the problem was, the scanner ended up in an awkward place, no doubt. \r\nAnd if the rumors are true, the SGN8 will have the Iris scanner, as well as the Fingerprint Scanner embedded under the screen, as well as the dual camera. Well, that's the future to tell, right? Ciao...", "date": "18 Apr 2017"}, {"text": "Well, if you're happy (read jealous), we're happy. For your info, after the last incident with Note 7, Samsung became cautious, which is a very good move for such a big company. If you would know even something about tech, you would know that the \"same 12MP camera\" is actually \"NOT THE SAME 12MP camera\", rather an upgrade on the sensor, keeping the same resolution. The camera process is also upgraded. I don't want to go into detail for someone who pretends to be sleeping. If you wanna know, why don't you go ahead and do some homework on the new camera unit? But the bottom line is that it is NOT the same camera module like last year. Everyone knows why Samsung put the Fingerprint sensor in that odd place, you should also. And if Iris scanner is a gimmick, well, I have nothing else to say then. I guess next you'll say a headphone jack is also a gimmick, right? LOL. And people are freaking out that SGS8 is more expensive than some SPEC-iAL phone out in the market. \r\nI agree with you, totally agree. The phone is ugly, pure ugly. Actually, it's the ugliest phone around in the market. No, the ugliest of any phone EVER MADE and WILL BE MADE. But only to those who are jealous.

I got a chance to use them for a while (as much as I could in the display units) and I would say they are better in person. It seems that Samsung has worked on the palm rejection and now it didn't bother me as much as on SG7e. I got a chance to hold the LGG6 as well. That's another good device, I'll have to say. But looks wise, SGS8 is the best looking device at present, in my opinion. I have rather small hands and I could hold the S8 without any problem. Even better, it felt very good in my hand and I could reach the awkward placed Fingerprint scanner with ease. But it wasn't the case with SGS8+. It felt large and I was unable to reach the back without some palm acrobats. \r\nNow, there will be no Bixby, at least, not in the beginning. The plan Samsung have with it is large. So, it will be huge when it comes in full, but till then I'd rather use Google Assistant. The UI seemed lighter this time around, so there's a slim chance that the device will not slow down in a year. But, who knows, right? \r\nThe price of the pre-ordered units are around 950 USD here in Bangladesh. I know, I know, they are very expensive. But they will provide 160 USD worth of Samsung DEx (fast charging) with it, so it will become 790 USD. And the shop that I pre-ordered with, Gadget&Gear, they will provide a 128GB Micro-SD card, worth 85 USD, which will reduce the price to almost 705 USD, which, in my sense, is a pretty good deal. \r\nI wanted an Orchid Grey version of the S8 with Exynos chipset, as many of you might know by now, but unfortunately we will be getting the obvious Midnight Black, Coral Blue (for SGS8+ only) and Maple Gold here in Bangladesh. So I settled for the common Midnight Black instead. Samsung promised to ship the devices on 8th May, 2017, all fingers crossed. \r\nAs far about the battery, some YouTubers recently showed that the battery of SGS8+ is marginally better than that of SGS8.

Regarding the SGS8, one must understand the following things while comparing it with SGS7e: \r\n1. The new processor is an upgrade from the last flagship (SGS7e or SGS7), which is now more powerful (a little, if not highly powerful) and faster (yet again, a little) \r\n2. The battery of SGS8 is 3000mAh, may not seem much on the paper, but reviewers all around the world in the web and in YouTube have confirmed that the battery is enough to work your way throughout the day using your phone moderately. For heavy users, it will last till dinner time. The reason for this is the SGN7 and now Samsung wants to play safe. If this year anything happens to SGS8 or SGS8+, then they will be in deep trouble. The battery is good, but not one among the best. That is why Sammy didn't even say anything about the battery life of the new flagships. \r\n3. RAM is good in my book. If a phone's OS knows how to \"manage\" RAM, then it doesn't need more RAM like 6GB or so. For example, look at iPhone's 3GB RAM. It's \"NOT ADEQUATE\" in someone's book, but is quite good in service. It's all about RAM management. Yet, Sammy is offering a 6GB version of the SGS8+, those who are complaining about the 4GB RAM being too low, can buy them instead. But as I know, those companies who are boasting about 6GB RAM in their phones can't provide a code for better RAM management. \r\n4. ROM is another thing everyone is complaining about. Well, in this case, the bigger is the better. A certain portion of the ROM memory will be occupied by the phone as usual, the user gets the rest. When a phone upgrades, the main OS embedded never gets erased, but the link is just re-positioned from the previous OS. So it is possible to downgrade your phone after the upgrade using \"flash\", until and unless you delete/erase it deliberately. \r\n5. People are saying that the camera is the same as SGS7/SGS7e. Well, in paper it is SIMILAR, not the same. They have used similar lens with same focus ability, but better sensor underneath. But bear it in mind, that the camera upgrade is NOT much from last year's flagships. Now the camera of SGS8/SGS8+ can take better low-light picture because it takes more than one photos in a mere second and combine them to reduce noise in the final display. The front facing camera though, got an upgrade. The 8MP camera looks good in paper. But the main feature that I like over the previous phones is that it now has auto focus and facial recognition, a much wanted feature. \r\n6. The screen looks gorgeous, absolutely stunning, to be honest. BUT, I personally am NOT a fan of 18:9 ratio. Though it is what made the screen look better, I liked 16:9 ratio better. None-the-less, this is one of the best screen available for cell-phones available today. \r\n7. The security is very strong on SGS8/SGS8+. You have fingerprint scanner (don't let me start on this). Sammy wanted to put an under-the-screen scanner, which was unavailable before the product launch. So they crammed the fingerprint scanner wherever they could - at the back, in a very awkward place. This is very hard to reach for both hands and a tall phone should have this even lower. But I'm glad that there is Iris-scanner present. Like the SGN7, the Iris-scanner is fast and accurate. But I wouldn't depend so much on the facial recognition, as it can be fooled by a picture of yours. \r\n8. I don't want to talk about the Bixby. Let it roll first, if I use it, I'll know how much it worth. But for now, I prefer Google assistant over it. \r\n9. Funny enough, now a days people don't argue much on the main thing that a phone is supposed to do, make and receive a call. Don't you think that should be our main concern on a phone? As far as my concern, the phones have great reception. The clarity is great over the network. \r\nLast, but not least, would you buy a SGS8/SGS8+ if you already have SGS7/SGS7e? Yes and no. If you have SGS7, then you should try out the edge screen and it's features. It's different. If you have SGS7e, then you might give it a thought. Is the Iris-scanner attracting you too much? Does the 18.5:9 ratio feels worth to you? There's nothing much on SGS8/SGS8+ other than the bigger screen, Iris-scanner, bezel-less display. The awkward fingerprint scanner is a no-go to me. \r\nIf you don't have the last year's flagship (any make), do you need to upgrade? Definitely yes, if you have the cash. A lot has changed in the last two years. So if you have the cash in your wallet, go out and check the recent flagship and buy one of this year. \r\nIf you're an iPhone user, do you need to upgrade to SGS8/SGS8+? Definitely no. You are into Apple environment because you like it. iPhone users should wait for the iPhone8 or iPhoneX, whichever they name it. As far as the rumor going, this is supposed to be awesome. \r\nSo, this is what I wanted to say. Sorry for the long post. Hit thumbs up if you like what I said. I would love to get constructive criticism. Ciao...", "date": "09 Apr 2017"}, {"text": "Have you seen S6 Edge+ or Galaxy Note5? Same battery with 5.7\" display.

Yes the battery capacity is related to size and weight, but the main culprit is thickness. Apple can afford a small battery, because their OS is locked and do not have multitasking, so their phones consumes in an optimized matter, this allows them to have smaller battery capacity and they translated that to thinner body. Unfortunately whatever Apple does, right or wrong becomes the trend everybody must follow and so did Samsung, they reduced battery capacity in order to reach the iphones 7mm thickness. They invented a lot of excuses to cover up for the resulting loss of battery performance and it kind of worked for women, who care more of the looks and prestige, rather than practicality, the male users though backfired and hence the S6 had the worst sales of the series, despite the all new marvelous look. With S7 edge, they hit the sweet spot, around 8mm feels, looks and is premium enough and can host a big enough battery to make the day, even for power users. Then the bezel war begun, which is esp important as the sizes have grown so much and the secret here lies at maintaining the 7,2cm wideness, so that it can be operated by one hand and reduce lateral sides to minimum and upper bezel as much as you can, this leaves even less room for the battery, yes the added height helps, a lot, but it barely compensates for the smaller overall space the minimum bezels demand. And after the Note 7 fiasko, they decided to let extra free space for the battery to breathe, so they couldnt get a bigger battery. The onky solution was to add 0.2 extra mm os thickness, then they could easily fit an extra 200-300mah on the S8 and S8+ and we wouldnt complain, but their obsession of having Apple like thickness, took the better of them and this is the reason why i wont downgrade from the S7 edge to S8...", "date": "03 Apr 2017"}, {"text": "lol you are hilarious .totaly agreed with you those are bad sales employee from other companies who dont nothing about tech he could easly bring 1 or 2 real concern about new s8 but he brings false reasons .", "date": "03 Apr 2017"}, {"text": "it is finally here my friends!!

This is purely my opinion. Dont get triggered or anything. They could had put bigger one like in the Note7. Note7 had 3500mah battery in a body just 5mm taller than S8 and it exploded. It was designed aggresively by Samsung.\n \r\nI noticed they put 4000mah battery on Galaxy A9 2016 and C9 Pro. Both are over 161mm tall. S8 is only 148mm tall. So, you can pretty much imagine the battery limit size relative to its body size - for Samsung at least. Oneplus 3 which is slightly bigger than S8 also sport a 3000mah battery too. Though, I find it odd how Oneplus update the Oneplus 3T with 3400mah battery without increasing the weight of the phone. LG G6 relatively the same size as S8 have 3300mah battery. 2800mah in LG G5 saved by its removability. We can continue to argue battery size with the XZ Premium which is bigger than Oneplus 3T but with mere 3230mah battery. To be honest, major brand rarely or never had any flagship with over 4000mah battery. \n \r\nSo, in the end there is no right answer with battery size.

I don't expect Samsung to update S1 to Nougat, but S6, S7 , Note 4, Note 5 the hardware is capable of running Android 7.0 My S7 is still running 6.0.1 with December 2016 Android patch level.

I have had an S7 edge for the past year and I do not regret it, the software isn't as efficient as an iPhone with resource management but it surely does make up with features. Atleast if I expose my phone to water it doesn't get destroyed instantly or even drop it from hip height, it would take a good 5 to 10 drops for the screen to crack compared to an iPhone which would shatter instantly. All of the phones are in the same money range so it is all a matter of taste. iPhones are a more software orientated phone where as Sony like to push and show what hardware and features can be accomplished in a phone of today whereas Samsung and Google make phones which are helpful with business management while trying to make something simple to use with semi-top of the line hardware to get things done at the same price as both an iPhone or a Sony.\n \r\nTo be honest, I am really looking forward to what Samsung are bringing to the market with the S8 and the S8+ and some of the features it carries.

In the remaining 14 minutes, the frameskip does not get much worse. But after six minutes, it is so severe, that your audience can get dizzy, and even 60fps are smoother than permanently laggy 240fps. \r\nAh yes, unlike Apple, Samsung's camera application since S6 (TouchWiz NatureUX 5) is severely vulnerable to screen rotation.

At the moment I am far more interested in the P10 or G6, here are my reasons:\n \r\n1. The screen / phone is too tall, far far beyond 1 hand use possibilities\n \r\n2. The easy shatter glass on the front and back is still there (take a look on ebay for s6 & s7 models and see how many of them have cracked / scratched and broken screens on front & back, it's quite concerning)\n \r\n3. The screen size to body ratio is no revolution, they could & can cut plastic bodies to far more accuracy than this +10 years ago (drip feed the public for maximum profit, same with the curved screen oled tech, it's over 15 years old now, could have shown up on the S4).\n \r\n4. Moved away from 16:9 screen size ratio, this is a really bad idea. If you watch movies or youtube a lot then your going to have some black bars appear on the sides and if they stretch (distort) the video to compensate for the new aspect ratio, that will put additional load on the cpu/gpu and will take it out of the battery.\n \r\n5. Still no front facing speakers on bottom bar, plenty of room there for it\n \r\n6. The phone does look good, however it's just a bigger stretched out version of the S6 edge and s7 edge, nothing new here.\n \r\n7. Software, bixby? Please... New model, now packed with even more bloatware from samsung (if I do get my hands on one I will be rooting it and flashing it with an Android Ice Cold Project ROM or Stock Android ASAP).\n \r\n8. Putting this thing in a case makes it look just as bad as all the rest, want a preview see s6 and s7 edge devices in cases.\n \r\n9. I was not impressed with the level of detail in the S7 camera (lots of noise in comparison I found), P10 and G6 cameras look really good (NOTE: G6 is not 16:9 either! /cry). Hopefully they they will fix this in the S8. However the pixels camera is really good.\n \r\n10. Finger print scanner location. Right at the top next to the camera lens. Great idea, NOT! G6 monkey face rear is about as good as it gets for this location for the finger print scanner. Putting it right at the top next to the camera lens is bad for the following reasons. 1. Can you reach it easily and unlock easily with 1 hand hold phone without turning it round? 2. How often are you going to put your finger in the camera lens dirtying that up?

Especially in late 2015. Samsung still does not have unlimited burst shots and 1080p@120fps. But the S7 really improved burst shots. It goes well above 20fps (around 22-24fps), and the endurance is 100 Shots. In lower light, it shoots at 10fps, but still stops at 100 for no reason. Better than those ridicolous twenty-shot limit from before.\n \r\nBut the S8 will probably bring 2160p@60fps. I dreamt for this glorious combination of smoothness and detail for several years. \r\nMaybe, it will also get pre-rec and OIS-lock, as known from Panasonic HC-V550 and some other camcorders.  \r\nPRE-REC needs more battery runtime. And it requires the camera to be in video stand-by, which is not easy with the user interface since S4, where photo- and video-mode were combined on one user interface. \r\nBut you will never miss a moment again. \r\nOIS locking is explained here:   \r\nIt will try to lock the OIS, always to point in the same direction, instead of following movements in a gentle way.\n \r\nThe projector will be useable as a night clock. Didn't the FDR_AX33P already have that feature?\n \r\nHowever, 2160p@60fps will be a glorious update. Make your space storage ready, because it will take twelve megabytes of storage for every second to be recorded. But it will allow to extract excellent still frames out of videos and to see very beautiful smoothness. Combined with 2160p \r\nAdditionally, you can slow down to half the speed, and yet have ordinary thirty frames per second TO SPARE. Perfect for video editing.\n\n \r\nMaybe, we will even get a DCi-2160p-mode with 4096\u00d72160 Pixels, which is an aspect ratio of 256:135, and this at 48 fps.", "date": "11 Oct 2016"}, {"text": "Just take the S5 and: \r\n- update CPU, GPU and RAM \r\n- Increase SDcard (same space, more GB) \r\n- Improve the IP to 68 \r\n- Don't, please don't put 4K screens... we don't need more pixels we can't see which drain our battery \r\n- Wireless charging out of the box \r\n- USB C\n \r\nYou will get everything you need (+ removable battery).\n \r\nAnd there you go... you have your S8 ready..\n \r\nAs a reward - you can send one towards me for testing :)", "date": "11 Oct 2016"}, {"text": "4k 60 fps Camera???!!!!!

You could survive for days.\n \r\nBut the peak brightness of the Note 7 was so high, that it could be used as a torch. But also the lowest possible brightness and also lowest possible loudspeaker volume because muting is important.\n\n\n \n \r\nFor me, there are no compromises. Who had a problem with the thick iPhone 2G? 12mm? Just make a phone in 2017 that thick, and you will be able to pack very much hardware into it, instead of struggling to squeeze everything into a slim casing. A phone as thick as that would still be comfortable to hold, if the exteriour is designed in an ergonomical way. \r\nWhat if you get trapped in a dark wood? Then, you better have multiple days of battery life with compromises. Better than the compromises of the wood itself.\n \r\nThat's just an extreme example. But think about the fact, that people from 100 Years ago permanently dreamt about such a versatile device, which also fits into the pocket. Alarm clock, video cinema screen, camera, camcorder, audio recorder, stopwatch, clock, barometer, hygrometer,  air thermometer, sport/underwater camera, slow motion camera, telephone (duh&#8252;), note/draw-book (Galaxy Note), torch (flashlight), navigation device, music player, computer (E-Mails, Schedule, Messaging, etc.), TV remote control, gamepad, combined cinema (group play), light sensor, MicroSD-card reader (I know, MTP is inferiour), USB-reader with correct adapter; pulse measurement device, video calling, \u00c2\u0085\u00c2\u0085\u00c2\u0085\u00c2\u0085\u00c2\u0085.\n \r\nALL THIS (may vary by device) fits into your phone now. You have it everywhere you go. (Did you:) Ever thought (think) about that? \r\nHow will people in many decades or a few centuries look back to today? Who knows?\n \r\nBut why is the mobile telephone so importnat in everyday life? It's just everything packed into one small device such as a smartphone. For us today, we forgot, how important and practical it can be. It's just everyday-life for us. Ever wondered, how hard it is for some people to live without it today? Does all stuff I mentioned above fit into your pocket? Maybe, the S8 will even bring us a night cinema with it's projector. Then, it could do things like displaying the time like a night-clock on the wall! How awesome would that be? I use a wall-projection alarm/radio clock for years, and it's so comfortable. But our phones do everything for us today. \r\nJust six years ago, many people still used point&shoot-cameras or camcorders to take movies of their kids in e.g. a theatre show, that their sweet and little preschool kids perform. I would say 95%. At that time, there was just iPhone 3GS and some VGA-recording phones. Those HD-phones such as the i8910, they always ran into deep trouble with light conditions and dynamic range. Now, I barely see any camcorders. Just mobile phones and maybe a few tablets. That's it.", "date": "10 Oct 2016"}, {"text": "Yeah. \r\nBut one problem with those phones is, that they are getting unpredictable.  \r\nIf somebody misuses the power of that phone (e.g. abuse the video camera), and has actually zero tech knowledge, and also does not know, how dangerous it can be, everybody can hold such a powerful weapon.\n \r\nExample story: \r\nSomebody gets a Galaxy Note 7, just because it is the newest phone, without even knowing about what it is capable of. (let's forget about exploding) \r\nThen, the power of 22 fps of burst shots, F/1.7, S-Pen, and others belong to him. \r\nSomebody has a Galaxy S2, but knows about the Note 7's potentials. He would know, how fast that camera can be.\n \r\nI don't know, how exactly I can stress my story, but if I would get the newest phone, and somebody else in my class gets it too, without having any technical knowledge (which would be my huge advantage), but just, because it is the newest phone, I would loose the pleasent feeling of being equipped in a superiour way.\n \r\nWhat if only people with more technical knowledge can buy flagships, because they had a license for it?

(better than 1440p, less space needed than 2160p. But 1440p is a good balance) \r\n\t\u00c2\u0095 Getting many lost features such as self-capacitive touchscreen layer or MHL (MicroHDMI) back. \r\n\t\u00c2\u0095 Slow-motion HDR video \r\n\t\u00c2\u0095 Camera: Set burst speed by dragging the shutter button up or down after pressing it \r\n\t\u00c2\u0095 Instant shot mode (shoot picture on shutter button push, and not release) \r\n\t\u00c2\u0095 Camera user interface: permanently show zooming bar + limit me to lossless digital zoom \r\n\t\u00c2\u0095 Log all possible data into the metadata during video recording (current zoom, focus, focus spot, all sensor data, exposure compensation). \r\nIf digital video stabilization is enabled during video recording itself in real time, it needs more system ressources, because the device has to struggle for stabilization.
