S8 is my third and last Elephone. My S7 was fine and still is after passing on to my wife. I wanted the big 2K screen and the 21MP camera. I got the big beautiful display but basically a useless camera. The S8 is now my mini tablet used for web browsing, ebook reader, email and occasional Youtube and it works fine for that. I gave up on it as a carry around phone after trying to take a video of a baby turtle release while on vacation in Mexico, a \"once in a lifetime experience\". Unwatchable with the continual hunting for focus. I have replaced it as a phone with a 5 inch screen, Helio X20, 3GB, 32GB (with a 128GB SD card) Kodak phone and a 21 megapixel camera that actually works ! It is very disappointing that Elephone has not tried to fix the camera bug since last October and I doubt that an Oreo upgrade is at the top of anyone's list. I have not tried Google Camera 7.0 and will not bother because I have my very good replacement. Shame because I could have bought a very good 7 inch tablet for less money to do the same thing.", "time": "15th March 2018, 04:54 PM", "postID": "post75899949", "replies": []}, {"text": "I have to say this phone has exceeded my expectations in every way. \n\n* Battery life is amazing once you remove the spyware. 2-3 days of normal use for me, and that's with Life-360 on all the time.

Really the design as a whole is far above what I was expecting in a cheap phone.\n* Fingerprint sensor is super fast and reliable\n* The OS seems solid as a rock. I've seen no problems with calls, wifi or bluetooth, and it hasn't crashed on me once.\n\nAs for the supposed cons:\n\n* No notification LED is no problem - just configure the NoLED app and it's brilliant.\n* Likewise the camera seems fine on mine. I used Open Camera for a few minutes and it seems just the same as my old Oneplus.\n* I don't see any of the video sync issues people talk about either. I don't use netflix so maybe that's still broken but ... look, it's 2018, get yourself a VPN and live free.\n* If you're into action games the decacore CPU sucks down juice like there's no tomorrow.
