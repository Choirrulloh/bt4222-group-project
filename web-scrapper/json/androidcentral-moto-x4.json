While it is a very high performer in essentially all categories, I began to wonder if it's price we're truly justifiable. \nI have always had a soft spot for Moto phones since my first flip phone and smart phone we're both Motorola products, the later being the Droid Razr M on Verizon. I decided to give the Moto X4 a try when Project Fi offered it for $250 with a $80 service credit after activation and here are my thoughts after four days of use.\nBuild quality: Definitely a high build quality with the use of quality materials. Moto seems to have copied HTC's glass effect, though possibly with a different method than the pigment impregnation of the glass back. The phone feels weighty, though very slick. It is actually quite difficult to hold on handed without a case because it literally slides down my fingers. Overall, build quality easily matches Pixel 2.\nSpeaker: While the X4 only has one speaker, the quality of the sound is superior to the Pixel 2. The Pixel 2 had a harsh quality at anything above 50% in my experience. The X4 actually has a deeper and better tuned sound that enables me to hear more detail at a louder volume than the Pixel 2. In fact, I can hear a podcast through my X4 better while in the shower than I could with the Pixel 2.\nDisplay: I have seen a few reviews about poor or mediocre display visibility in sunlight, but I haven't had that experience at all. The display is both bright and clear with excellent saturation on normal display settings. While technically lower resolution than the Pixel 2, the difference is imperceptible.\nPerformance: here is possibly one of the two most obvious differences from the Pixel 2. The Snapdragon 630 in the X4 is noticably slower than the 835 in the Pixel 2. It is not frustratingly slower, just noticable. I have not had ANY issues with performance with either phone so I hesitate to say the more expensive Pixel 2 is worth the extra money for this reason alone. I can literally do everything I did with the Pixel 2 with the X4.\nCamera: The X4 camera is, hands down, inferior to the Pixel 2. The lack of OIS is blatantly obvious. With that said, the camera tuning from Moto is respectable because I can actually get pretty good pictures with the X4. Better, in fact, than I was able to achieve with the Moto Z2 (putrid product, btw). While the Pixel 2 camera had excellent performance and legitimately good added features, the extra features in the X4 camera app are more surprisingly impressive than the Pixel 2. In everyday life, the X4 camera features are more satisfying to use.\nCharging and battery life: battery life for both is comparable. Charging speeds are a whole different ball game. The Pixel 2 crawled to 100% as far as flagship phones are concerned, but the X4 flies! This comparison is with both phones using their OEM included chargers. The one shortfall of the X4 is that it tends to get quite hot while turbo charging.\nCall quality: Using both phones on Project Fi in Raleigh, NC, neither phone had reception issues of any sort. The main difference is that the X4 speaker is superior and allows me to hear the other person much more clearly than the Pixel 2. Other than that, there are no perceptible differences. Both switch seamlessly between carriers and WiFi and both utilize VoLTE very well.\nBonus: The X4 can connect to four different Bluetooth devices at the same time which is pretty awesome and unexpected for a mid range phone.\nFinally, my person preferences led me to choose the X4 over the Pixel 2. It can do 9/10 of what the Pixel 2 can and at a far lower price. That's all I can think of for now, but if anyone has questions about the X4 please don't hesitate to ask.", "time": "02-28-2018 02:19 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6175872", "text": "Interesting review, since I recently bought a Pixel 2.

Great phone. I got the Fi version. I've had Nexus 4, 5, 5X and 6P. This phone is right in there. Specifics:\nScreen: great quality, I can't tell any difference in vibrancy, density, clarity, etc. It looks great. Larger than the 5X, smaller than the 6P. It's a great size. It is not as easy to read in full sun as the AMOLED on the 6P.\nSpeed: some early reviews were worried about it being slow, or slow to respond to touch, etc. I'm not seeing any of that. It's like butter.\nCamera: again, I almost didn't buy the phone because some early reviews really trashed the camera app as slow and poor. It is not slow at all! I think the whole criticism was fake news - really. I like the phone features. As to quality, to me, it is like all my other Android phones. Good pictures, but not as good as iPhone photography (don't know what it is that Apple does to make their photos so damn good!) My only criticism is no Photosphere. I do use that from time to time. There must be a separate app somewhere that I can get to be able to continue.\nFeel in the hand: Much easier to handle that my 6P, but still a handful. I'm a \"no case\" guy and the phone is slippery, but so was my 6P when I first got it.\nLook: ehh. It's not bad, but nothing special to look at. Personally, I'm not a fan of the rounded corners and sides. The camera hump doesn't bother me at all. A little thing, but on the screen, the \"Home\" capacitive button, instead of a single circle, it uses two concentric circles, and I don't like it. I'm sure it will grow on me.\nCalls: great phone! Phone earpiece is louder than my 6P. Handles calls beautifully.\nFingerprint reader: it's on the front bottom and I was worried I wouldn't like it, but it's a non-issue. I use my two thumbs instead of index fingers. Same - same as 5X or 6P.\nStorage: It only comes in 32G. I have 133 apps installed. 22G used, 10G free. BUT - it has a SD card. \nSoftware: Motorola did a good job in living up to the Nexus (AndroidOne) spirit. There are only 3 Motorola apps on the phone. One, their Home launcher (got rid of it in a hurry - love Nova). The other I love, which is a notifications app. As your hand goes over the phone when its locked and the screen is dark, it will light up with time, battery strength, etc. Very nicely done and optional. It also has options to stop the phone from ringing after you pick it up but before you answer it, or lay it facedown to put the phone in \"do not disturb\".\nOverall: to me, it's definitely a major step up from the 5X. It's maybe a little step down from the 6P. But, the price was great, and since BOTH by 5X and 6P were casualties of the bootloop, I wanted to get what I thought was a better built, \"tougher\" phone - a Motorola. Don't know if that's true, but that's my perception.\nSo, no regrets! Love the phone.

Fortunately, my wife had ordered an unlocked one for me from Motorola and it arrived Saturday so I set that one up and I have been using it.\nThe issue I had with the Amazon version, and I am sure it was just a problem with that partucular phone as it has not happened with the one from Motorola, was that it would not always charge. I plugged it in Friday morning when I first got it and charged it to about 92% before I started going through the setup since I knew that would tax the battery. The setup went fine and it was only down to about 82% when that was done. I used the phone throughout the day like I would with my current daily, the Moto Z Play, and I didn't need to charge it until Saturday morning around 10:00 am when it got to about 18%. \nI plugged it in and saw the Turbo Power connected message and saw the charging battery icon in the notification section, but when I cam back about an hour later, it was in battery saving mode and was down to 12%. I made sure the plug was in securely, flipped to the battery screen, but it showed that it was not charging. I switched chargers and cables but still got the same results. I then rebooted and charging started working so let it charge up to about 45%, used it for awhile and then wanted to fully charge it to take it out with me for the day. Again, I had the same no charging issue and had to reboot to get it to charge. At that point, I boxed it back up, got the refund started with Amazon, dropped it off at UPS, and set up the one from Motorola.\nNo charging issues with it or any other issues so far. It is plenty fast, the build quality is really nice, well except for the thin SIM/Memory card tray, bit other than that I like it as much as I did my 2014 64GB Moto X Pure, which was my daily phone until I wanted super battery life and got the Z Play.\nI got a few compliments on how nice the phone looked, especially in the Sterling Blue color, as one of my friends thought it was stainless steel. The brightness of the screen when using it in bright sunlight is what I would expect since I have had all of the Moto X 's and the Z Play, not great but again, not unexpected. I will wait to comment on battery like once I put it through a few days of typical daily use. I know it will not be like my Z Play, but if it can make it from topping it off in the morning before work and last until I get home, then that will be fine.\nI love the feel of it and will use it naked until my clear Cimo Premium Slim Protective Cover arrives in a few days and then I will see how much extra thickness that ads, but for now the Moto X4 is batrely noticeable in my pockets and while it is kind of slick, I have not had any issues with coming close to having it slide out of my hands.\nI haev enjoyed all of my Moto phones and still have two of the 2013's, one is still brand new, I skipped the 2014 initially and bought the 2015 without even seeing it, which in hind sight was a mistake as it was just a bit too big and top heavy for me to use comfortably. I kept it around as a backup but will be listing it for sale soon as I only used it for a month or so before I luckily caught the 2014 64GB Pure on sale directlt from Motorola. I enjoy the battery life of my Z Play but wanted something smaller to replace my 2014 Moto X and this X4 seems to do that nicely.\nI will follow up with battery life, teh clar case, and anything else that I feel I should mention, sometime later this week. \nI did buy a Samsung Galaxy S8 when it came out and while the screen looked great and it was fast, I cannot get used to the 18:9 aspect ratio and it was so slick that I knew I would end up letting it slip if it I used it for too long without the case, so I sent it back. The phone that I compare everything too for feel and screen size, and this may seem odd to a lot of people, is my LG G Flex 2. That has been my favorite phone as far as in the hand feel, size in my pocket, and overall screen size without much extra bezel. I have a Galaxy Note 4 with a second number that I use as my work phone, and I will sometimes take the micro sim out of it and swap it in the G Flex 2 so I can use it. A 5.5' screen is really the sweet spot for me as long as the overall phone is not too big and I was really hoping that LG would have continued the Flex line. \nAnyway, I am a gadget nut and keep way too many of my old cell phones and tablets, but it is fun to go back and use some of them everyone once in awhile and I am definitely not going to run out of backups.", "time": "11-05-2017 09:55 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6056764", "text": "Well, I spoke too soon on the battery charging issue as it happened again this morning.
