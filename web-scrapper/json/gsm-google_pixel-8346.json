And the reason behind this is, Google doesn\u00c2\u0092t sell these phones directly, they sell it through Third party resellers and thus the 14 day clause, which is not mentioned anywhere. But this seems to be an eyewash and the real reason is unknown. \r\n5.\tWhen the phone is submitted for service, since it\u00c2\u0092s a sealed phone from all sides, they heat the LED and apply pressure on the sides to get the LED out of the Panel, which leads to more damage on the Panel due to pathetic quality of the paint used on the panel. But the service center or Google Support know this, they will never accept it, as the damage can always be dropped on the customer on the grounds of \u00c2\u0093AESTHETIC ISSUE\u00c2\u0094. \r\n6.\tProper answers will never be given by Google support or the service center.

Many Huawei and Xiaomi phones have outsold Nexus devices. Google Nexus/Pixel devices are niche. Google is not a hardware company. They rely on Samsung and others to help sell Android which helps Google sell mobile ads. They lack retail stores for true aftercare services. They lack an ecosystem since any mobile browser in any platform can work their services. \n \r\nWhat is special about this Pixel device? Nothing except fastest software updates. Nexus devices were never really best at the features they offered. Samsung doesn't offer anything new but they excel at hardware aspects like display, battery life, camera, and recently design. Not in any given year prior was a Nexus device ever the best smartphone of the year. They never excelled in camera and battery life. They never had the best displays or audio. They no longer hold a price advantage. \n \r\n2010 - Nexus One, Nexus S. Not the best that year. Went to iPhone 4.\n \r\n2011 - Galaxy Nexus. Not the best. Weak TI OMAP SoC. Best was probably S2, 4s, N9, or first Note. \n \r\n2012 - Nexus 4. Weak glass and battery life. Poor camera and washed out display. Best was probably iPhone 5 or Note II. \n \r\n2013 - Nexus 5. Same issues as predecessor. Best was Note 3 surpassing LG G2... \n \r\n2014 - Nexus 6. Probably the first truly excellent Nexus. But best still goes to Note 4 surpassing it, OnePlus One, iPhone 6 Plus, and HTC One M8. Last Note with removable battery. \n \r\n2015 - Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X. Best probably was another Samsung with the S6 edge or + variant. Note5 took a step backwards. \n \r\n2016 - Pixel, Pixel XL. Note7, S7 edge, iPhone 7 Plus, and maybe LG V20 surpasses this. \n \r\nThe last 4-5 years a Samsung had the best overall phone even if Google's oil don't mix well with Samsung's vinegar. Samsung should leave Android. That's Samsung's main Achilles. Their software skin is no good on Android. But they excel in hardware and the only true OEM out there. \n \r\nAll you are buying is for faster software updates with Google devices. It isn't BEST in any other aspect except maybe in Android speed tests. It loses in many other areas and have zero hope it tops in camera and battery life being an HTC.
