I've been rocking a Galaxy S3 since it first came out and strangely, it's never failed once. In fact it still runs though far slower than other phones. I'm at a crossroads. I haven't been able to get carrier network updates and am stuck on Android 4.2.2 \nI'm not a fan of spending high dollars for a flagship phone since I'm not a gamer nor do I stare at it constantly like many do. And while I know the camera in the Axon isn't great, if I want to take awesome photos I'll get a DSLR. \nI want something faster, easy to view in daylight, works on ATT and is running at least Andorid 7.\nSo does buying a used Axon 7 make sense?

The only downside is the camera when used to take indoor shots. They come out on the dark side even with the flash. Outdoor shots are excellent. My favorite phone and now my daily driver is the V30.

I'm curious as to how many of you owners are out there. If you have one then it's 100 percent safe to say you indeed have the sleeper phone of the year 2017. Think about it when you pick your phone up next time. Check out the build quality. The high end all metal no plastic premium build. Then go to YouTube and take a listen to your favorite song or watch your favorite movie or something. The speakers are nothing short of amazing. Then go to your browser and check out the speed of the 617 processor in this phone. It's plenty fast and zippy. In fact I've not experienced any lag in my Axon 7 Mini at all. Then open your camera up and take a few photos. They are crisp. They are clear. The shutter is fast. It's 16 megapixels strong. Then take a look at the amoled display. Check out how punchy the and vibrant the colors are. The resolution is sharp, crisp and clear even though it being 1080p it's HAD Amoled. Have I left anything out on this phone. If I have please feel free to add to my post more features about this phone as I want to see what I've left out that is important in what makes a phone good and not average. So with that said we us owners of this phone the Axon 7 Mini get all of the above mentioned for only $199. Taking all of that into account there is no other phone on the market that comes close to what you get with a Axon 7 Mini for the money you spend. I mean what other phone on the current market gives you top notch features some being flagship level such as the build and speakers that you can easily compare price wise to the Axon 7 Mini? I buy and sell a ton of phones. I mean a lot. I know for a fact that why this phone has not simply flown off the shelves is merely the fact that it's actually priced so low that most mobile phone consumers have written this phone off to be cheap and on par with that of of other sub 200 dollar phones which if you think about it, if you have not picked up this phone and held it, listened to it, browsed through web with it and take pictures with it you'd automatically think that you get what you pay for. So in fact this phone has been widely written off by even the major phone article companies to be that of a cheap $199 phone. Well they are right about it being cheap but they have omitted the most important thing. User quality. There is simply not another phone for this price that gives you anything near what the Axon 7 Mini gives you. I mean it's become my daily driver. For me to say that means something because I do go through just that many phones. Will it become my back up phone to my newest phone I have coming? Well yes, but that phone will have a 820 processor and was once a $700 dollar phone upon it's initial release meaning it was a flagship phone in 2016. What I'm saying is that there is a reason all of us Axon 7 Mini owners still have this phone and still use it on it on a daily basis. You get an upper level mid ranger device for the price of a very low tiered phone in today's current market standards. Look at the regular Axon 7 for example. That phone is flagship in every since of the word but you only pay $399 for it. That's the price of a decent mid ranger in itself right there. My conclusion is that most consumers and even professional writers which by the way I can do much better than most of them have simply written the Axon 7 Mini off to being portayed to that of in which the price would lead one to believe it is. Which is cheap. That can be the only reason this phone never took off. In fact it's the only reason. You know most people think they can put a price on everything meaning if you spend cheaply then you in turn buy cheaply meaning you get a cheap product. I'll be honest. This phone would have sold better had ZTE left the price at $299 because right then and there people automatically would have placed this phone in another category being a step up above cheap. To the professional writers, what's wrong in today's market that a company can produce quality and the consumer actually get a good deal as opposed to the price being the very means to a product being worthy or not. Simply put Axon 7 Mini owners out there we got what you call a good deal. What a nice breath of fresh air in such a greed filled industry we are in. My hats off to ZTE for going against the grain and offering a high level quality product at a below market value price which equals nothing more than a what is called a good deal. So in ending this post the Axon 7 Mini is by far and away the sleeper phone of 2017. To those consumers and writers who stuck their nose up to the $199 price tag, well shame on you for not doing the least bit of homework and research when only to look at a phones worth by it's price tag. This is the society we live in today. Writers included. Just because a phone is selling for $199 does not always mean it's made of cheap plastic and poor quality build. Sadly though majority of consumers and professional writers have simply done that here and wow did they get it entirely all wrong. This is the best and well made phone that $199 can buy and to those those that think just because it's $199 it's worthless, there is not a piece of plastic on this phone. The speakers are the best you can get in the idustfy. The processor is that of a mid range phone which that's what the Axon 7 Mini is. The 1080p amoked display cones both on mid range and flagship phones. There is just not any other way around the fact that majority of the market got it totally wrong on this phone. Pick this phone up and use it for a few weeks and then read my article again and tell me that price is everything and the quality of a product basically means nothing. I think by far and away this is the best mid range phone on the market for this price and that my friends is a absolute fact. Thank you for reading.

How honestly if you are saying this that you think the Axon 7 Mini is not a premium built hardware wise phone? For the money there is not a better built solid performing phone that compares to the axon 7 mini at only $194 on Amazon. Identical build as the regular axon 7. Identical Dolby Atmos surround sound speakers used. Sure the processor is mid range but the phone is only $194. The screen is amoled with punch vibrant colors. The fingerprint sensor is good. The processor while not the best isn't bad at all and I speak from experience as I have been using this axon 7 mini as my daily driver for a couple months now but as of Saturday the honor 8 will take it's place. Overall how can you say the axon 7 mini is not one of the best phones in 2017 in terms of value and price point for what all that you get. It's nearly identical to the regular axon 7 except for the different processor which I've found to be pretty good in fact. Sure it's not an 820 like the axon 7 but hardware wise it's as every bit as premium as it's bigger brother is. There is no plastic on this phone. In fact I just watched a movie tonight on my axon 7 mini and didn't even feel the need to connect it to my external Bluetooth JBL speaker because the speakers on this phone are probably one of the very best you can get compared to pretty much any other phone. Then the all metal body build that is very premium. Unless you are looking strictly at the 617 processor to evaluate this phone there is nothing cheap about it but yet you can still buy it new for just under $200 bucks. I think the phone is very much one of the best sleeper phone of 2017. I've enjoyed using it. I'm not sure why you think it's not a worthy phone when in fact it's built much more like that of a $400 dollar phone easily.", "time": "10-27-2017 05:47 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6041187", "text": "I already made a comparison in post 2 .I am not saying that it isn't.

If you refer to the Axon 7 and Axon 7 mini, niether of them have wireless charging. They are constructed of full metal bodies and therefore niether is capable of that. I assume this is what you were asking. My post was to simply state that the axon 7 mini was ignored by the majority I believe bc it was so cheaply priced therefore they wrote the phone off to be cheaply made to relate to it's cheap pricing when it's just the opposite actually. The axon 7 mini is flagship build quality. The speakers the best of any other smart phone. It has a fast accurate fingerprint sensor. The only drawback if there is one to the axon 7 mini would be it's average processor but that said the phone is extremely optimized to perform very well with even an average processor. I've not experienced any type of lag and the speakers by far live up to the hype on both phones. They both are identical other than processor and screen size but I prefer a 5.2 inch screen as my daily driver to a 5.5 inch screen which is pretty large to handle in one hand or to put in your pocket. I just think if the professional writers actually had spent some time with the mini their articles would have elevated sales for this phone but since most wrote it off it's definitely become a sleeper phone as it's by far the best made phone in terms of it's $199 price point. I use an honor 8 now as my daily driver and now my axon is a back up but I was still very happy with it while I used it on a daily basis. There was nothing lacking in the phone.

I've yet to hear or see anything about the Axon 8. Did it say if it will still have the same awesome speakers. This is a huge selling point to me of the Axon 7 from getting to see just how good they are with the Axon 7 mini model. Also I like all metal phones. I really hope they don't do two things which I'm afraid they will at least do one. One is making the screen into a 18.9 ratio. To me it makes absolutely zero sense to take away from the classic width of a screen and then make the phone taller which just takes away from the overall viewing experience as the phone becomes way too narrow. This is a major reason I got rid of my Samsung S8. The crazy not needed fad of the 18.9 ratio. Let's hope they won't join the fad but I'm betting they do just like every other company has so far. Number two getting away from the all high end premium metal body and build and going with the fragile glass front and back. ZTE makes an awesome built phone and that's bc it's all metal. Even the Axon 7 mini is identical to the Axon 7 in terms of high end build and the high end speakers. As long as they avoid these two major things then I'd be more happy to wait on the Axon 8 but I have to think one of these two major changes will be made for the Axon 8. I can deal with a glass build but I refuse the 18.9 crazy no sense making fad of just a way too narrow phone. It's absolutely horrible for movies and media. So if the Axon 8 is 18.9 then I won't even think of getting it and I'll opt for the Axon 7 even though it will be dated. I've wanted the phone since release but I never did get one for one reason or another. I personally want the silver model. The only downfall to the Axon 7 is the non back lit nav keys. I have to think that must have a learning curve in the dark being that they are so close together. Also it seems it's kind of hard to still buy a new Axon 7 anymore as they are mostly sold out everywhere. So I'm unsure if I'll ever have a chance to get one as I just bought the 64g pearl white honor 8 which is my all time favorite phone. I'm a huge fan and supporter of EMUI software. It's vastly different than Android the highly unique so I bought it to become my now long term daily driver. The Axon 7 if I get one will not be my daily phone bc of the large 5.5 size. I prefer a smaller one handed device for my daily driver and the honor 8 is almost perfect for that. If it were 5.1 it would in fact be perfect. I can use the 5.2 inch size with one hand but it's a bit of a stretch in some cases. The Axon 7 would be my media phone for movies and web browsing. Plus I like the quad hd display too. I may just buy one used instead of new to save money if I can find a silver. I can't do the gold as I am not a fan at all. I just know the Axon 7 mini is the sleeper phone of 2017 so I have to think the Axon 7 is a heck of a phone for the money.

It's a hard device to beat for being slightly under 200 dollars. I go through a lot of phones so I'll use this one for a little while and I think my next one will be the Moto Z Play. I like the Moto mods and already have a few from having had a couple of the Moto Z phones in the past. The battery life on the Z Play is unbelievable. I'm hoping this nougat update will help the small battery on the Axon I have as it doesn't last very long. It's got quick charge and usb c type port so those are pluses too. If I don't get the Moto Z Play then it'll be another Honor 8 as I used that phone for a good while or probably the longest since I switched over to Android a little over a year ago now from Apple. Anyways overall this Axon 7 mini is a steal for under 200 so I couldn't pass it up. Plus I think the quality of the build far exceeds it's price point.", "time": "09-13-2017 09:14 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5973451", "text": "Most, if not all OEMs send out updates in batches.

So why a review so soon? Read on. Let me say first off that I'm a tech junkie. I've had 8 smartphones in less than a year. The ones I like, I keep. I sell the rest. So, I'm comparing the A7 to the LG v10, galaxy note 4, S6 edge, S7 edge, nexus 5x, nexus 6p, Google pixel, and axon 7 mini. I bought the A7 because of its superior audio system. I was so impressed with the mini, that i decided on going full tilt. Upon opening the box, you could see right away the quality built into this phone. Every inch of the A7 was a perfect fit. Using the \"we share\" app transferring all apps and files from the mini, was an effortless task. Not only were these transfered to my new device, but they were also set up 100% correctly as they were in the mini. So after updating 22 apps and doing a system update, I was ready to rock & roll with the new axon in less than 40 minutes. Im using project fi in this phone so I'll be on the T-mobile network. I also slipped an already loaded 128gb sd card into it so my media, both music and HD movies, were good to go. So far there have been no hiccups of any kind. The A7 is fast, smooth, and does everything you ask it to without a hitch. Calls were very clear. And the screen very vivid and colorful. It was nice to receive such a high end product WITHOUT getting ripped off. The audio system on this phone, complete with dolby atmos, is outatanding through speakers and headphones. And, yes, better than the v10. I'm so happy with the A7 that it will become my main phone. I have an S7 edge that I also love, but the audio on it is very much lacking. The screen is a bit better than the A7 though. Now as far as the new pixel is concerned, Google can keep it.

The screen was very bright and vivid and colors looked great. \nThe rear facing camera was decent and the front facing left a little to be desired.

I know the 10 costs about twice as much so if you didn't come from a more \"premium\" phone you probably wouldn't see an issue.

Congratulations", "thread": [{"postID": "post5589332", "text": "I've only had it 2 days. So why a review so soon? Read on. Let me say first off that I'm a tech junkie. I've had 8 smartphones in less than a year. The ones I like, I keep. I sell the rest. So, I'm comparing the A7 to the LG v10, galaxy note 4, S6 edge, S7 edge, nexus 5x, nexus 6p, Google pixel, and axon 7 mini. I bought the A7 because of its superior audio system. I was so impressed with the mini, that i decided on going full tilt. Upon opening the box, you could see right away the quality built into this phone. Every inch of the A7 was a perfect fit. Using the \"we share\" app transferring all apps and files from the mini, was an effortless task. Not only were these transfered to my new device, but they were also set up 100% correctly as they were in the mini. So after updating 22 apps and doing a system update, I was ready to rock & roll with the new axon in less than 40 minutes. Im using project fi in this phone so I'll be on the T-mobile network. I also slipped an already loaded 128gb sd card into it so my media, both music and HD movies, were good to go. So far there have been no hiccups of any kind. The A7 is fast, smooth, and does everything you ask it to without a hitch. Calls were very clear. And the screen very vivid and colorful. It was nice to receive such a high end product WITHOUT getting ripped off. The audio system on this phone, complete with dolby atmos, is outatanding through speakers and headphones. And, yes, better than the v10. I'm so happy with the A7 that it will become my main phone. I have an S7 edge that I also love, but the audio on it is very much lacking. The screen is a bit better than the A7 though. Now as far as the new pixel is concerned, Google can keep it. The battery life is outstanding, but excellent on my A7 and S7, but, really, nothing else is great on it. Its the worst 700.00 bucks I ever spent. It's also ugly as sin.

Outdoor pics almost just as good. I don't have 3 phones. I've got 4. I didn't mention the ZTE axon 7 mini. I was so impressed I bought the axon7 for the better screen, camera and speed. I started the year(2015) with th LG V10. It was a good phone, fast enough, but had to many lows. Only the 808soc, a good screen but nothing compared to the S6 edge I gave up. Bad battery life. But worst of all, it was a huge, uncomfortable to hold and carry beast. So after 4 months as soon as the S7 edge hit I grabbed one and sold the monster. I really love my S7 edge. Its the perfect size, extremely fast, always reliable, great battery life, that curved superamoled screen but poor audio system. Then I fell for Googles hype and bought what was supposed to be the elite of elite phones, the pixel. What a let down. Just an average phone not worth half what they were asking. So when the axon7 mini went on sale, I bought one and fell head over heals with its unbeatable audio system. So when the black friday deals came out, I upgraded to the regular Axon 7. Its been a joy. Beats pixel hands down and keeps right up with the S7 edge except the curved screen on S7 EDGE is a bit better. So now I'm back to carrying only 1 device, my axon7. And I'm loving it. I'll save the other 3 for when the axon 8 comes out. I'll sell the pixel, axon 7 mini, and S7 EDGE. And get the 8. I always keep another phone for a backup. You never know. If the galaxy S8 has a hifi dac system, I may consider that one, but only after I see what ZTE has in store for the axon 8.", "time": "12-26-2016 12:11 PM", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post5620618", "text": "Thanks!\nThis thing looks so good it's easy to forgive 1 or 2 small things.\nMuch appreciated Rumblee1", "time": "12-25-2016 03:19 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5620637", "text": "Your welcome.

Axon has the advantage on screen and sound, the OP3 on performance/smoothness. Still too early to call on battery life and camera, but I'll update after a couple more days.\nLong version:\nI got a OnePlus 3 recently and its a great phone. My bf recently shattered the screen on his phone (an older Samsung) so my inner gadget-freak saw this as a reason to try out the Axon 7. Even thought I really liked the One Plus 3 I was drawn to the thought of having a QHD resolution screen again and I also liked the Axon 7's emphasis on sound because I listen to LOTS of music at work. And, it didn't disappoint in either of those areas.\nIt just arrived late yesterday evening, so here are some initial impressions of how the two compare:\nHand feel: The Axon 7 feels noticeably chubbier and heavier in the hand, but not by a bothersome amount. The Axon's curve fits into the palm well, so overall I'm happy with it too.\nScreen: Both have vibrant/colorful screens, but the Axon's higher resolution gives it an edge in terms of everything looking just a touch smoother. (I tend to hold my phone pretty close to my face when using it). They each have some screen color/warmth adjustments in the settings, and the Axon's looked better to me when I was done. I am guilty of liking unrealistically vibrant screens and the Axon on 'Gorgeous' setting was happy to oblige. \nSound: External speakers: No contest, the Axon is amazing, and Dolby Atmos was surprisingly good at adding distinct stereo separation and even a bit of pseudo-surround. No contest here in terms of which phone I'd rather watch videos/TV on.\nSound: Headphone: closer call here. The OP3 (after an update done a few weeks ago) is noticeably louder on headphones than the Axon, but the Axon's sound is richer overall. Once again I was pleasantly surprised by Dolby Atmos. Normally I keep that kind of stuff off, but after messing around with it a little bit I was able to create a custom sound setting that I *really* liked.\nSpeed: The OP3 has an edge here. Both were very smooth in general use, but the Axon has tiny hitches/delays more frequently than the OP3. Not anything that reached a point that it truly bothered me, but the OP3 is really outstanding in this regard, and the Axon is a bit less outstanding. (I've just been using MiFavor 4 so far, haven't tried alternative launchers yet to see how it does with those.)\nFingerprint reader: So far so good, both phones have fast/excellent fingerprint readers.\nCamera: still tbd. First impressions are good. I've not yet had time to really explore the Axon's camera options. Some pretty intriguing settings I'm looking forward to trying, but haven't done anything extensive yet. I did a very low light shot that it made practically look like daytime, albeit a bit soft. Unfortunately I have lots to do tonight, so won't get a chance to take much time, but definitely will put it through its paces this weekend. I'll grab a couple shots at lunchtime and post those, but I'm sure it'll do well in broad daylight.\nA few small sidenotes: I really like the ZTE Locker for lock screen wallpapers. It has some very nice ones and it's nice to have them randomly change each time I double-tap to look at notifications or just check the time. Both have useful gestures, I think it'll be very much individual preference as to which is better. Charging speed is very good with a quickcharge 3 plug. Battery life overnight was excellent. More to come after a few days use.

I'm also flopping like a Magicarp between the OP3 and Axon 7. \nI'm leaning OP3 because of the software and camera, but part of me keeps screaming that the Axon has some better hardware. Radio signal strength between them seems fairly even, and not industry best either way, but the Bluetooth issue is something I hadn't thought of yet. I do use Bluetooth a lot, between my Moto 360, a BT speaker I use semi-regularly, a couple of pairs of Bluetooth headphones which are the only way I normally use headphones, and Bluetooth streaming/calls in my truck. If the BT is weak on the OP3 and better on the Axon, that may just be my deciding factor. \nI've also considered the Note 7, even if it's LITERALLY twice the price of either the OP3 or A7 ... but I just can't convince myself that the top notch camera, S Pen, and water resistance are worth it. I suppose I could just buy both the OP3 and the A7 and return my least favourite within the 15 day window ... but with delayed shipping times and my luck I'd probably get one 14 days before the other. LOL\nOn the camera side, I don't worry as much about low light and auto mode. I love the camera on my G4, but auto at night sucks. I go manual. The OP3 has the advantage of shooting in RAW, but they claim the A7 will be getting that in an update. A7 also offers 240fps slow mo video vs 120fps on the OP3. Not a major thing in every day life, but if I'm shooting slow mo, the more fps the better! \nIt's great that phones have gotten THIS good at these prices, but good grief it sure makes it hard to decide what to buy!!", "time": "08-28-2016 01:17 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5376387", "text": "I haven't measured distance accurately for BT on my Axon 7 yet but I CAN confirm that it reaches my BT earbud by >30' and my stereo headphones by >25' and that's through walls in a house.

I wasn't feeling the Moto X that much so I got the Axon 7 in grey.\nI am now using the Axon 7 as my main device vs the S7 Edge. The main reasons are the stereo speakers, I prefer an all metal build, the rear finger print sensor (S7 edge is so low that I find myself unlocking it with the pattern vs the fp sensor), the overall look of the phone, I like the 3 pinch screen capture, quick charge 3.0 charges pretty fast , I really like the toolkit app package it comes with, I liked the sim/sd card slot tool keychain it comes with, the USB-C and the dual sim card tray. \nI'm really digging the weather widget it comes with and the voice and gestures controls. One of the commands I had been longing for a long time was the ability to control your music with your voice and this phone lets me! Like when I'm taking a shower or shaving or whatnot, I always have my phone playing music and it's nice to skip to the next song without touching the phone. I dig the stock notification sounds (I know these can always be changed but I never, I use whatever it comes with but I really the selections Axon made), pretty cool wallpaper selection. \nI kind of got tired of the no edges of the S7 edge and it lags a tid bit, so far I experience zero lag on the Axon 7. One thing I do wish the Axon 7 had that the S7 edge has is it being water/dust proof. I do prefer the stock messaging app the S7 edge has vs Axon 7 but I can always replace that with something else. I don't like that on stock operating system, the max # of apps width wise is only 4, so I'm using Nova Launcher on the Axon (actually on both).\nI do think the S7 edge takes better pictures and I like the Always On Display, but overall, I'm happier with a $349 phone than a $750 phone.", "time": "12-29-2016 05:02 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5586432", "text": "Mine is arriving via UPS today.

I use the stock player. Ugly interface, but it sounds terrific and you can turn on dolby right from the app. I also downloaded onkyo player. That supports dolby also and had a better interface than stock player. Ive got an Astell&kern high resolution music player, and the audio capabilities of the A7 blow that A&K away. So, now, i only have to carry 1 device with me. My Axon7, and, of course, headphones.

I'm a bit more compelled to protect the screen on this phone since I plan on using it longer than 2 years.\nIt seems to me the two most recommended screen protectors are the tempered glass one, that people complain about because it doesn't fit the Axon 7's curved screen, and the wet Delta Shield one.\nI'm leaning towards the Delta Shield, can anyone who has this one weigh in? Is it easy to apply? I saw on amazon there was a review that someone ruined their Axon 7 because some of the solution from the protector seeped into the speaker grill.

(got it on sale black friday)", "thread": [{"postID": "post5596479", "text": "So I've had the pleasure of using the Axon 7 Mini (gold variant) for the passed 12 days as my daily driver. I put my Galaxy S6 to the side and gave this puppy a try. One of my favorite phones was the HTC One m7 and I've been looking for a phone like it ever since so how was my experience?\nFirst boot went pretty smooth and quick (unlike the pocket now first impressions which was a longgggggg first boot) I've installed the apps on it I needed most to see if it would be a good replacement to my S6 battery-wise\n(apps include Instagram, note taking app, calculator, and a music game to test speakers)\nI'm gonna have a good section and bad section for my review.\nThe Good----------- \nThe phone ran smooth, not the fastest thing in the world but if you are just gonna go on instagram with it, watch a few videos and send some text messages you should be good to go. The phone was slower in other uses tho (seriously a game called opsu that doesn't use that many resources with settings turned down was dropping from 60FPS to about 27 and averaging around 44... unacceptable if you ask me... ran flawlessly on every other phone I've tried)\nSpeakers was AMAZING! I left my phone playing a song and went to the other side of my house and could clearly hear it, I went to a crowded mall and heard music from the speakers without issue loud as can be. No distortion at full volume\nThe fingerprint scanner was the quickest I've ever used, there is no point of a lock screen on the phone honestly you never see it.\nPhone comes with dual Sim support and SD card support for those who use those features. I never use them so it didn't really add to my experience\n1080p res was perfectly fine I watched a ton of YouTube and a downloaded movie with no issue colors were pretty good (I used high contrast mode in the settings) \nPhone charged pretty quickly, nothing crazy but faster than other phones I've used\nBuild quality was top notch! ZTE didn't skimp out on build quality that's for sure\nHeadphone playback was above average, louder than my S6 meaning it was more enjoyable (especially in my truck with the AUX)\nThe Bad----------\nLike I said above the frame rate skipping is kinda crazy if you ask me, this wasn't some HD graphics intense game it puts up little circles you have to hit to the beat of the music so that was disappointing (note: i only tested 1 game I wasn't gonna use this phone to game with so I only tried something that made sense with the speakers\nPhone call experience was horrible, I barely make phone calls but the few that I made was all bad experiences... the phone would lock up if you pressed the speaker option and not actually change to the speaker phone for like 10 seconds pretty crazy\nWhen using the music app it would take about 5 seconds longer than another phone just to bring up the list (something that should be instant, I have 630 songs FTR)\nthe phone had a lot of stutters and app crashes (T-Mobile visual voicemail crashed on me at least 12 times and it never crashed on another phone for me) \nWhen plugging in headphones and removing them the phone would sometimes think they was still plugged in and not give out any audio unless you used the headphones or restarted the phone\nthe battery wasn't that great, there wasn't a screen on time viewer but I would estimate I was getting no more than 3hours 25minutes SoT (note: the phone does not come with a quick charger in the box)\nthe camera wasn't anything special, dull colors washed out images and blown out highlights (front camera was below average)\nSo was this phone worth $200? for sure! if they make another software update and fix some bugs yes. Would I say this phone is worth $300? no not at all. a lot better options imo\nWho is this phone for? if you like hearing music without headphones, watching a lot of YouTube/media on your phone and primarily use texting/messenger apps this phone is for you. \nDo not buy this phone if you want to take pictures, videos or make a lot of phone calls on the current update it has\nHave any questions? feel free to ask", "time": "12-07-2016 12:19 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5599436", "text": "Ive yad mine since launch and its been great.

I said Yes and all the Apps I had on the OnePlus got installed on the Axon right away. Mistake?\nDuring that first installation, the battery of the Axon went down like crazy.

So I figured: \"lots of work, let's see later\" I charged it with the charger right after, fully.\nThe next day was fine. But I'm not a player, my main uses are the social apps (Facebook, Twitter), some text messages, one phone call that lasted 15 mins, web browsing, and some pictures (like 10) at night without flash.

The phones are on plain white copy paper.\nSome other thoughts to go with this:\n1> My carrier is AT&T, I have no issues to this point using LTE with the sim in either slot. I'm not sure if it does it on the Note 4 or the G4 but when I am on a phone call the icon changes from LTE to just 4G. I am still able to browse etc while on the call.\n2>Battery life has been very good for me. ending my day at about 35%. My normal day of use puts both the G4 and the Note 4 at 10-15% or less, sometimes needing a bit of a charge, to make it through the day from 5AM to 9PM.\n3>I have had zero random reboots that I am aware of. Since I listen to a bluetooth headset for music during my work day I would know if one happened during that time but at night I would not be aware of one.\n4>Speed of the unit is quite zippy. The UI comes with two launchers built in, the MiFavor one and the Stock Android one. I normally use Nova Prime and have experienced no lag or stuttering that I can see.\n5>Fingerprint scanner to unlock the device has been flawless and very quick...almost instantaneous.\n6>I have not used the camera very much but the pictures I have taken have turned out satisfactory.\n7>There has been no skips or pops in the bluetooth music streaming that plagued my Note 4.", "time": "09-30-2016 06:25 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5457106", "text": "Number 3", "time": "09-30-2016 06:26 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5457111", "text": "Number 4", "time": "09-30-2016 06:27 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5457118", "text": "Number 5", "time": "09-30-2016 06:30 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5457144", "text": "Keep us updated", "time": "09-30-2016 06:48 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5457322", "text": "Thanks for all the info and pictures.", "time": "09-30-2016 09:12 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5457841", "text": "I also have had virtually no issues at all with my Axon 7.

If you purchase your phone outside of ZTE then you must abide by the return policy of that vendor. So if you buy from Newegg you can not return the phone for a refund. With Best Buy it's 15 days only. B&H is honoring the 30 day return. If the phone is defective ZTE will replace it. But if it was purchased somewhere other than ZTE then ZTE will not refund the phone.

Might have to have a chat with newegg Canada. Part of my reasoning for ordering the Axon (because I was ridiculously close to ordering the OnePlus 3) was the 30 day return window. I figured that would give me time to decide if it was what I wanted or not. Hmmmm.\nEdit: WRT the non-contract phone return policy at newegg - the Axon 7 does NOT fall under that policy. If you look at some of their other unlocked phones, they specify the non-contract phone return policy ... the A7 falls under the standard return policy. So basically, you can return it, but you'll get hit with a restocking fee in all likelihood. Even in the section where they list the Passport 2.0 features, they exclude the 30 day exchange line.

Not very happy about that. Had I known that, I would have ordered elsewhere because I am not going to use a Gold case. I may contact them and see if I can return it for something else.\nThe navigation keys REALLY need to be backlit. My solution would be for pop-up screen buttons when the light sensor detected a very low light level. It's another small niggling point. Not major, just an observation.\nSetup was fast and very easy. Transferred everything from my S6 Active and got all my accounts synchronized. Didn't play with the camera much as I was too busy being amazed by the sound from the speakers which was one of the major selling points for me.\nThe phone is quick but it does hang in a few spots. (Thought it may be learning.) I noticed that opening my USAA app takes a couple seconds where on the Active, it was pretty instantaneous. The fingerprint sensor is AMAZING and I set it as security for all of my banking apps that allow it and it works flawlessly.

Odds are that I'm personally not going to do it anyway. I've had Nexus phones (my wife still does) and I've done all sorts of rooting, romming, flashing, tweaking, messing about. Then I went last year to the LG G4, and there is no bootloader unlock for it (yes, there is a model that's unlocked, but I don't have it). While my inner geek is sad that I can't mess around with ROMs and such on it, at the end of the day, I'm okay with that. I use the phone mostly for my daily life ... calls, text, messaging, snap some pictures, occasionally some video. Once in a while I'll take out the tripod and do some long exposure night shots/light painting ... but if I want to really get crazy, I break out my old SLR so I have aperture control too.\nThe two year warranty, and really reasonable 'deductible' for out of warranty repairs they're offering is quite impressive. 80 bucks for a screen replacement out of warranty? Hard to beat that! What makes the unlocked bootloader great, in the long term, is that if ZTE abandons software updates for the phone by the time that 2 year warranty is gone, hopefully there will be enough of a dev community there to keep the updates alive unofficially. That's the power of an unlocked bootloader in my mind. Not so much for the now ... but for the two years from now.\nI'm also wondering, and might have to take this to the Z Community forums for an answer ... even if it voids the two year warranty - does the unlimited out of warranty repair offer still stand? IE: instead of two years of free repairs, does it become two years of factory repairs at the cost of the standard deductible?

No updates just for the security patch. If I remember correctly, the phone has had two maintenance updates and one system version update, so not bad really. Unfortunately I've had a ton of unresolved issues since the jump to Marshmallow.\nI watched ZTE's webinar about the Axon 7 and they kinda-sorta-but-not-really committed to keeping the patches up to date.

The OP3 has the same strike against it that waiting for the new Nexus phones does - no microSD.

I wished he had the iPhone to compare the 3.\nBut for me as long it takes decent and takes really quick pics I'll be happy. I rather pay an unlocked phone (I have T-Mobile) for $450 that has the high specs and doesn't quite compare to Samsung unlocked for $700+", "time": "07-03-2016 02:51 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5249942", "text": "", "time": "07-03-2016 03:41 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5250499", "text": "WoW\nAxon sound best , S7 worst\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "07-04-2016 02:54 AM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"postID": "post5252867", "text": "Thanks is for sharing these links.
