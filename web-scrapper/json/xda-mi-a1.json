As a result, this phone is very much attuned to how I use a phone.  It is fast enough and has enough memory. I read books on my tablet or computer.  I play games on my computer. I watch videos on my computer and/or my TV.  The screen real estate on a phone is too small for me to want to read books, play games or watch videos, and I don't want to carry a small tablet as a phone.\n\nI came from Samsung and Apple phones, and I gotta say, value for money, this phone rocks!  \n\nSamsung was forever behind in updates/patches and no OS upgrades unless you bought their top $$$ phones, and the bloatware was just ridiculous! (My Note 10.1 2014 NEVER got an update from KitKat, and the security patches were 1.3 years old when it finally gave up the ghost)\n\nApple build quality has gone off the rails in my opinion, and for what you pay for those phones, value for money is horrible. (6s lasted 14 months of LIGHT usage.  2 months out of warranty, bricked)\n\nThe A1 costs ~1/4 the cost of an iPhone, so even if it only lasts 14 months (I'm looking at you Apple) then I can buy another one and still be way ahead.\n\nAndroid One: OS Upgrades and timely security patches \nExcellent build quality on mine\nVery good battery life\nOreo!

I was really hoping that the dual lens camera would be at least VERY good.  It's ok, but nothing to write home about.  Hopefully this can be resolved with software in the future.\nAn I/R blaster app that requires basically unlimited permissions? Why?  It would be useful if I dared use it.\n\nI liked mine so much that after using it for 3 months, I bought a red one for my wife!  Oh, and SHE likes it too, even if it isn't an Apple. \n\nI like good price/performance ratios in things I buy, and I feel the A1 gives me a very good price/performance ratio!
