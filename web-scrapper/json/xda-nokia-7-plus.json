While it's a good phone for the price I must say that WiFi performance has been meh. \n\r\nIt's stable for the most part but it switches very, very aggressively between 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz when you have a dual band AP with band steering (so that means that the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz have the same SSID). \n\r\nThat is because 5Ghz will always have just a little bit less signal strength in RSSI than 5Ghz and the device decided to switch to the stronger signal of the 2.4Ghz. This drives me CRAZY because I have fkng 5Ghz in every inch of my house. \n\r\nAlso the throughput isn't stable on 5Ghz. It seems like the device goes in some kind of aggressive battery optimized mode instead of giving the full throughput that is available. For example when connecting the link speed might be 433Mbits but without moving the device will drop automatically to 200 or less without reason...\n\r\nEDIT: contacted Nokia support.
