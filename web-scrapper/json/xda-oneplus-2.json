We had a brief glimmer of hope that AK would work his magic on the device and for a short while he did, however since his departure it's been nothing but crickets.\n\nI mean, at least we've got the likes of Lightning & Nuclear Kernels on OPO carrying on and continuing to improve AK's work on that device. On the OP2's end, not so much.\n\nBeyond that, it's pretty clear that the state of OP2's development community is pretty poor overall, very few \"official\" ROMs, and even with the unofficial builds do have access to, it basically always boils down to choosing between forks of Grarak's CM and 'debloated' stock ROMs. Not that there's anything wrong with either, and I am thankful for what we do have but there is certainly an evident lack of diversification and overall developer interest. In many ways much of the blame for this falls on OnePlus themselves but it really is a shame because the OP2 is far from a bad device, it's actually a really good device with great potential that isn't being unlocked because it's been shackled with sh*tty software that no one wants to work with and/or is not being provided the tools needed to work with it. \n\nI think a lot of this ultimately comes down to OnePlus not wanting to swallow their pride and acknowledge that they cannot do for the OP2 what CM did for the OPO and for as much of a douche as Kurt McMaster is, he's not wrong in asserting that the OPO's success was built on the back of Cyanogen. OnePlus was not the reason for the One's meteoric success, the development community was and if 1+ continues to work against that community it will be the reason that not only the OP2 but the company as a whole fails. They had their formula for success, people like us were drawn to the OPO because it appeared to be a device that truly embodied the spirit of what it means to be an Android user. As of late they haven't been doing much except for sh*tting all over that formula, and their customer base. Take one look at the state of the 1+ forums today, compared to what it used to be when OPO was in it's prime and the decay is self evident.\n\nRemember hearing that with the advent of Marshmallow we would be able to implement OP2's fingerprint scanner in custom ROMs due to it's now native API, yeah.. about that.", "time": "18th February 2016, 07:45 PM", "postID": "post65394435", "replies": [{"text": "I couldn't agree any less, Oneplus should have swallowed their purpose and let cyanogen on board, their development cycle just sucks and cyanogen would have made the combination untouchable! \nStill no time lost and they should explore the partnership again...", "time": "19th February 2016, 03:08 AM", "postID": "post65399314", "replies": [{"text": "Just to comment on ak kernel.

I'm quite impressed by this display!\n\r\nTo achieve a D65 (6500K) whitepoint and 2.2 gamma, as per sRGB standards, I've used the following settings:red: 255\ngreen: 233\nblue: 159\nsaturation: 255\nhue: 0\ndisplay value: 260 (it basically affects the gamma)\ncontrast: 255\nresulting in:Black level = 0.2804 cd/m^2 (shouldn't change)\n50% level = 122.72 cd/m^2 (dictated by the gamma)\nWhite level = 517.92 cd/m^2 (lost some brightness, unavoidable)\nApprox. gamma = 2.19 (much closer to 2.2)\nContrast ratio = 1847:1 (I can live with that!)\nWhite chromaticity coordinates 0.3121, 0.3288\nWhite Correlated Color Temperature = 6540K\n\r\nIn my opinion, increasing the saturation above 255 is counter-productive, as it will only result in clipping. Furthermore, the vast majority of media content (unless you're working with professional Adobe RGB-based workflows) has most likely been designed for sRGB devices - or at least something with comparable gamut coverage. AMOLEDs are exceptional in terms of \"color richness\", but might result - if not properly calibrated - in unrealistic over-saturated colors.\r\nThe side-effect of these settings is the appearance of banding in images with blue gradients, such as... blue skies.

I've been fooled into buying this phone when my need for dual SIM phone fell on this pick (from GS5) as my work phone. [fake] Reviews said how good the screen is (too bad I haven't read XDA review first) but I never seen such a bad unsaturated contrast-less screen on any phone, and I have more than dozen android phones in my personal possesion (and over 20 in 'android career').\n\nI usually prefer AMOLED and let me start first here - there's no comparison to screen quality full stop. So I picked my LCD HTC One X+ (hardly used) that was taking dust for 3 years as I knew it had amazing screen back in the days, run display tester... not comparison either. Actually, I don't have phone with such a weak display at home!\n\nSo I opened my amazing trusted Latitude E6410 laptop, the greatest Dell ever built (still works!) with the cheapest poorest screen though 'made for business'. Guess what, this washed out Latitude is having better contrast than One Plus Two. And I thought I never will see worse screen.\n\nI'm keeping the phone as business, 810, having two sim cards and bigger screen running CM13 is more important for me than color quality, but it's quite a shock from my previous phones... won't be having it more than 6 months so what...f^%k it.\nCan't wait for Galaxy S7 edge enough, dual sim version with Qualcomm running CM14 please", "time": "16th March 2016, 04:42 PM", "postID": "post65873728", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Clarity/resolution", "rating": 5.0, "links": ["https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-2/review/clarity-resolution-t3246692", "https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-2/review/clarity-resolution-t3246692/page2"], "threads": [{"text": "1080P is still great.
