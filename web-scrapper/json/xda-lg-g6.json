As far as the design of the phone it is definitely a sturdy and sleek-looking phone. I do have issues with the Bluetooth app force closing a lot and I don't enjoy having the volume buttons on the side again. I keep turning off my screen when I instinctively go to turn up the volume. But with that being said the S8 does not have the remote feature on it and the speaker location is in the exact same spot meaning I'll cover it with my phone sideways on either phones. I did get a case and that has helped. Another thing that I like about the LG G6 is the location for the power and fingerprint reader is place in a very good spot and feels natural when turning it on and off. I can't wait for a route to come for custom kernels and ROMs but if it's anything like the G4 that may or may not ever happen.

Till now, iPhone4 was, IMHO the best ever built phone (too bad I really dislike iOS), that combination of glass and aluminum.. Now, iPhone 4 comes in second, LG G6 comes first.\r\nDisplay: since I had G3, actually, except for size and proportions, it's nothing special because G3 had an awesome display. Btw I like LCDs more than OLEDs because I don't like that yellowish hue and cartoonish colours.\r\nUser interface and overall UI:  Good, doesn't lag, intuitive, overall satisfiing.\r\nBattery: good, from 5 to 15 hours of bat time depending of use.\r\nCamera: well, the only awesome thing about this is the wide angle camera. There are just some things that only a wide lens can capture, and I personally like the wide angle look. \r\nAnd that concludes what I like about the g6.\r\nStandard rear camera is just OK, takes a lot to autofocus, when you use the shortcut to open it it really does open fast bit takes sometimes up to 3 seconds to take a picture and sometimes picture doesn't even get saved.\r\nAt low light it's just crap. I'm sorry to say that in these days even a calculator makes good pictures in abundance of light. Autofocus lags, then takes ages to snap a photo and when it does everything is blurry. Flash doesn't help because it makes everything bluish and again a bit blurry. I bought this phone mainly for it's camera and because I watched a lot of reviews and it looked really good bit no one made a real life test which consists of 3 steps: seeing something interesting, getting your phone and snapping a pic, and not in perfect conditions. Static or on a tripod, and then zooming in and comparing the microns, that's not real life.\r\nI tried pixels ported camera app.. It's sometimes a bit betterb that's all.\r\nSelfie camera: nothing good about it, wide angle, noisy, bad aperture and anything less than 100% perfect conditions produces very bad photos. I'm so sorry to say that but Samsung S7 makes better photos, a 1 year older phone. \r\nI defended the colours of LG for almost 3 years but now I get to see that LG hates Europeans. No quad DAC, no wireless charging (my G3 had it) and the headphones are a 5\u20ac POS and G6 is (was) most expensive in Europe.\r\nI want to love this phone but to say it's a \"flagship phone\" is an exageration and I think it is the last LG I own. I'll probably buy an S7 (because G6 value drops so rapidly it's almost funny) and with all of it's quirks and yellow display enjoy at least in a good snapper.  :-/ Perhaps if I save a bit could buy a Pixel.", "time": "17th November 2017, 08:47 PM", "postID": "post74548865", "replies": [{"text": "It looks like we're lucky with the G6-- supposedly the V30 camera has even worse low light performance.

S7 from my region has the Exynos chipset so not possible for the Google Camera apk to be sideloaded. Also need to mention the bigger capacity 64 GB vs 32 GB and the new display form (latest design).

I took into the att store and they ran a diagnostic check on it and told me that the quickmemo app was hitting y processor pretty hard which is strange because I have never used it (it also doesn't show up under battery usage). It can't be disabled but I forced stopped it. When I did force stop it my ram usage dropped by like 10% so I don't know what the heck that app is doing. The odd thing is it will occasionally start up again and I have no idea why. I did open the app and set the capture+ action to be handled by gallery instead of quickmemo and there are no permissions set for it, so we'll see what that does. I'll be watching it closely.\nThe biggest culprit I believe was my outlook app was having a contact sync issue. Once I went on the app and fixed that issue my battery life has been great. I hit my phone hard yesterday to try it out and while I only had around 4 hours of SOT when the screen wasn't on I was listening to music (probably at least 4 hours of music playback). I downloaded apps from the playstore, surfed the web, streamed some videos, took photos and lot of other heavy uses and it made it from 6am to 6pm  with 10% left before i plugged in.

Poor cell coverage area where phone is sucking up juice trying to stay connected to towers. \n\nBest way to trouble shoot is to start with a 100% clean factory reset phone. Follow these steps \n\n1. Reduce screen brightness as much as possible, using auto brightness helps, but you may have to adjust manually if it's at full \ud83d\udd06 in your location. \n\n2. Don't install any applications at first. If your battery drain doesn't happen until after you install applications, then you'll need to figure out which one is the culprit. \n\n3. Turn off the cell radio in poor coverage and see if that does anything. If your battery improves you know that's the issue.
