I\u2019m going to turn 79 this year and both my vision and hearing are feeling their age. The Mate 9\u2019s display, a 16:9 LCD screen with 1080p resolution, was easier on my eyes and the speaker seemed louder.

Lastly on sound, I find the Bluetooth sound output is also a bit lacking but that could just be a placebo affect from the difference in headphone sound. \nHaving said that, everything else is an upgrade: battery life, the screen on the pro is better, camera, speed of the device granted the 10 is no slouch either, software is ugly and needs a launcher/icon pack lol but software functionality is on point for the most part--emui5 finally adds to the Android experience rather than takes away. But yeah, despite the headphone sound it is an upgrade in every other way in my opinion.

It's only been an hour so I am still playing with it. I will say this, its very nice. Keep in mind it's a Beta, so some things are quirky and some thing are missing/incorrect. That being said, here is what I have noticed so far:\n1. Do not ask me about battery life, it's only been an hour, I will say your battery life will probably be what it is now.\n2. The settings are as they show in the Android 8.0 screen shots and how they show in the Mate 10 videos. Yo have to dig around a bit as things are more condensed and there not as obvious as the once were. No big deal, but it took a minute to find some things.\nAlso there is a display setting that is new as well. You can switch from HD (1280x720), FHD (1920x1080, or Smart, this will automatically lower screen resolution to save on battery.\n3. The System information is incorrect at this point. Here is what I see:\nA. Device name is Honor 8\nB. Model shows as M300-L29\nC. EMUI version shows as 5.0.1 (so I don't know if its 8.0 or not, someone help me out on this)\nD. MEID is all 0's\nE. RAM shows as 2 GB\nF. Internal storage shows as 11GB free and 16 GB total \nG.Security patch is September 5th\nH, And for those that care the base band is 20.201.44.19.845,20.201.44.19.845\nAgain this is a Beta, so things may not seem right. I can tell you my storage is fine, and my RAM is as well.\nOther things I have noticed, no option to reconfigure the soft key's, they are fixed in the stock position. Also no option to hide the soft key at this time. Install unknown apps has no toggle to enable you have to enable each app. No new wallpapers or sounds as of yet. The camera is slightly different as well. The top has different icons and there is a 3D Panorama added that was a 3rd party proior. I will attach a screen shot of this at the bottom.\nThere is a new feature that I thought was cool, it a private screen. It's like a user space that you can have a different setup for. So it's secured and has to be used with default storage set to internal, it won't work on an SD card. \nI can say as I am restoring my data, it is noticeably snappier (placebo possibly) but it certainly does appear to be faster and less hesitation opening apps or switching back through resents.\nSo that's all I have for now. I will update later once I get some time in with it. I want to look at Bluetooth function to see if its better/updated.\nSo there it is, this is going to be a great build once it's put of Beta. With any luck it will be available soon and a bit more polished as well. Stay hopeful and keep an eye out for the final release, it's going to be worth it.https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx9HKaADOzCwX1IwYkNVMHR0T00/view?usp=sharing\nThe icons in order are: Flash, Wide Aperature, Beauty, Moving Picture (its like a GIF or short video), and the rest are the same#Update #\nIt turns out you can configure the soft keys, hide them and enable the floating nav button. Turns out it's in the smart assistance setting. It's a very cool feature. Much easier to use than fling or any third party app I have used.\nAlso just like Beta B230 Android Pay is broken. It should be fixed with a stable release\n#Update# 1:33pm\nPicture in Picture works great and it's pretty awesome.

So my only drawback is I really really wanted the silver model which I have a want to trade 6p for 6p up right now in the market place for my frost white for a silver model. Not sure I'll get a bite but worth a shot as I really do want the silver model for some reason. To me in terms of looks it's the best where I see a lot of people prefer my frost white color over the silver and it actually seems that the silver is the least of the favorite colors of the models but I just love the silver for some reason. If indeed I do have to stay with the Frost white I'll be perfectly fine as I can definitely live with it but hopefully I'll locate a trade out there and grab the silver.

Tried automating a call so that was always on speakerphone ON, Didnt work. \nI know it's something wrong with the phone since all other Tasker automated profiles are working fine.\n2. Another symptom: Wear speaker (which is an app for Android Wear that does exactly that - turning speaker ON automatically when answering a call) also doesn't work.\n3. And another thing: Voice answering also doesn't work. Call rings, but neither \"answer call\" nor \"reject call\" voice command do a thing. At one time that DID work, but ONLY when phone wasn't in silent mode - when the call ringing was silent or on vibrate it would not work. So one day I let it ring on silent and enter quick toggles (while silently \"ringing\") and turned on sound hoping it would than accept voice commands( answer or reject), but I did exactly the opposite.

I like that phone very much, especially the PKB. But I don't need the PKB all the time. When I am on trips, or just tooling around I started to notice that the small screen size was a bit annoying. Also, the older processor meant that it was a bit laggy at times and apps just take a bit longer to open than I would like.\nSo I started to look for another device that I could use in addition to the KeyOne. I discovered the Mate9 from a friend who had one. He raved about it, and so that stuck in my mind. \nI went to BestBuy this morning looking at the Galaxy S8+. I have bad memories of Samsung products though. Both my S6 and S7 started life off well enough, but within a few weeks of getting it -- the stutters and lag were just too much.\nSo I was looking for something much faster. And looking at the S8+ in the store brought back the stutter memories as I watched a slow frame rate S8+ display model do its thing. It was more fluid than my S7 but still not great compared to the Mate9 I had observed. Coupled with the $200 difference between the phones clinched it. I got the Mate9. I also didn't like the tall display. When looking at things in landscape, sites got funky. Sites without good mobile optimizations still work decent on a 16:9 screen so I often go into landscape for those kinds of sites. This seemed terrible on the S8+. It was also awkward for me to hold. I also do read eBooks, and so the tall screen ratio doesn't seem to work well for me.\nBut I have been pretty impressed with the Mate9 so far. I'm still trying out the camera, that seems to be where the phone might let me down. I hate the phony \"wide aperture\" mode. The zoom is nice, but the images seem a bit grainy. This is where the Samsung seems to have the Mate9 beat. Oh well, can't win them all (right now).\nBut the performance is excellent. Reminds me of an iPhone but with the power of Android. The dimensions are good -- and it even came with a little case and a screen protector which surprised me. All of the packaging materials were excellent. The charger took no time to charge it from 50% -> 100% even while doing updates in the background.\nFor $449 this thing is a bargain.\nI don't think the Google keyboard is very good (okay, I hate it), but that could also be the PKB residue in me. Anyone got a good keyboard recommendation?\nI'm also looking forward to the IR blaster!

I was happy to hear that but the next minute I was told, the work around is to switch the OK Google hotword detection off!

Tl;dr, I'll probably keep the Mate 9, but it will likely become a backup to the Pixel XL.\nI got the Mate 9 three weeks ago and had been using it as my daily driver until yesterday when I received the Pixel XL I ordered back in February from the Google store (two weeks earlier than I thought).\nBefore the Mate 9 I was using the V20, which I've had since launch. I got the V20 to replace my Nexus 6, which now lives in my car, and was generally happy with it though I will say the speaker left a bit to be desired. I bought the V20 mainly for screen size and the fact it had Nougat out of the box. Second screen is cool, but I can live without it. Certainly not a gimmick though. Removable battery wasn't important to me nor were the quad DAC or the other advanced audio/video recording features. \nI bought the Mate 9 thinking I'd give it a shot since it also had a big screen, sort of stereo speakers, Nougat and great battery life due to the 1080p screen. I was generally happy with it, but the aggressive power management (which can be dealt with but takes a lot of tinkering), the weird notification quirks, and the overly complex settings were starting to bug me. Don't get me wrong, it's a great phone, but these little things can be annoying. It's also a big phone (as is the V20, which is nearly as wide and a tad taller albeit with a smaller screen not counting the second display).\nFast forward to yesterday when my Pixel XL arrived. I know it's still the honeymoon phase, but man this is a nice phone. Yeah, the screen is smaller but with DPI adjustment it'll fit as much as either of the other two while still being readable. Battery life has also been pretty good despite all the playing around with it. Plus, and perhaps most importantly, stock Android. It's nice to not have to use Nova, mess with settings to make it like stock, and otherwise just be able to enjoy the phone. It also feels good in the hand and is much more manageable than the V20 or Mate 9. Time will tell, but I'm really digging it.\nUltimately, I think the Pixel XL will become my daily driver, with the Mate 9 as a secondary/backup phone. I'll probably sell the V20, though that is also TBD. \nI'll end by saying all three phones are really good and, depending on one's individual needs, I would not hesitate to recommend any of them. \nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading.", "time": "03-23-2017 09:17 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5723567", "text": "Nope battery life is everything to me has been since I started with smartphones and no other device provides the same quality build Great software and tremendous battery life.

The Mate 9 does have exposure modes (eval, center weighted avg, spot) that the V20 does not but since I shot manual/raw, I can adjust in LR. \nOver all the Mate 9 is a great phone, just, for me and my needs, the V20 ticks a few more boxes.", "time": "04-03-2017 07:04 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5742414", "text": "Fred which app is giving you trouble ??", "time": "04-04-2017 03:30 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5742443", "text": "LINE. \nViber sometimes, but LINE is the one thats killing me.", "time": "04-04-2017 04:08 AM", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post5737718", "text": "I'm just at about 24 hours with the G6 and so far, I'd have to say the Mate 9 is the better phone (for me).

I adore my Mate 9. The battery life is insane, it's lightning quick, and it's super well built. I think the camera is definitely good enough, too.\nOne of my biggest complaints with the taller phones is that it takes my biggest problem with the current aspect ratio and makes it worse. When I'm viewing pictures and other media, I don't want the black bars. On the ultra-tall phones, they are actually dramatically reducing the dimension that's limiting how large you can display media. We kind of have to work the math backwards here since they measure the hypotenuse when they say 5.8 or 6.2, but the aspect ratio is 18.5:9 on Samsung's new phone. \na^2+b^2=c^2 is our formula\n18.5^2 is 342.25\n9^2 is 81\nWhich means the hypotenuse, in the ratio is the square root of 423.25, or ~20.57\nSo now we work that back to get the width of the phone:\n6.2\"/20.57 is ~.3, so that's what we'll use to get the rest of the dimensions of the screen\n18.5*.3 is 5.55\"\n9*.3 is 2.7\"\nSo, let's see if it works: 2.7^2+5.55^2 is ~38.1, and the square root of ~38.1 is ~6.2 (It's 6.1725... but we got close enough)\nThat means the width of 2.7\" is the restraining dimension on the phone.\nNow lets go to 16:9 aspect ratio and see how big of a phone we'd need at that size to get the same width. More maths:\n2.7/9 is (you guessed it) .3\n16*.3 is 4.8 (.7\" shorter than your tall screened phone)\nNow we figure out the triangle 2.7^2+4.8^2 = 30.33\nAnd the square root of 30.33?\n5.5\"\nDo the same for the smaller Samsung and you get 5.15\"\nIf those numbers look familiar at all, it's because they are. Those are the sizes of the Galaxy S7 edge and the S7. Photos and videos won't be able to be displayed fully any larger on Samsung's new S8, even though it has a bigger screen. I thought both those phones were too small for my personal preference, which is why I went with the Mate 9.\nAnd on my Mate 9, when I shoot 3:4 photos for full resolution, or take photos from my camera, I still get the black bars, so I don't want to exaggerate that.\nNow all that being said, it would have been real nice to get an OLED display, and maybe the higher pixel density, and perhaps a better set of lenses on the back, but this phone runs so damn fast and efficient that I really have a hard time complaining about anything.\nSamsung and LG can keep their faux-large screen phones.

Mate 9 of course has EMUI 5.0 which it's not the 5.0 I like rather just EMUI I like so much. It's nothing like stock Android at all. It does have s huge 5.9 inch screen which I have to think that to be like a small tablet almost. Between these two all bias put aside, which am I better off getting? I have to think the Zenfone Deluxe will indeed be Android where the mate 9 will indeed not be Android. Actually I have written several articles about EMUI being so different than stock Android that it could rather easily be branded as a third choice of mobile tech software and I've won contests here from the articles. EMUI is the real deal and it's in it's own entire league and category overall. Doesn't matter if it's 4.1 or 5.0. It's just EMUI in general. It's the smoothest non lagging none sticky none choppy software that you can get on the market to include apple IOS. Anyone out there had any real life experiences with the UI of the Zenfone?

I hope to use that to allow myself an app drawer etc\nThank you", "time": "11-03-2016 01:42 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5543783", "text": "Brutal?

You would think it would work the same as the car if it was an issue with the phone. \nWhat other phones have you tested?\nEdit: I decided to go out to my car and test a few things. First I replaced the USB c cable I got from Best buy with the Huawei cable. I did have to re-engage the call screen like mentioned above the first time. Then I tested when I plug the phone in and unplug it. Unplugging it never made a difference whether the car was on or off. Plugging it in however did. If I waited to sync fully loaded before I plugged in, text messages wouldn't read. The dots came up but never played. However, if I plugged it in while the mustang splash logo (F-150 in your case) was up it worked perfectly. The call screen worked Everytime after switching cables and engaging it the first time. Text read perfectly as long as I didn't wait to plug the phone in. I don't know if it's truly the phone or is it sync itself, which as we know is not the most stable system. I can't tell you how many times my screens gone black and I had to turn the car off for 15 minutes for it to come back. Now you add Android Auto which has been quite buggy and who knows what's going on. \nAnyway, if you're using a 3rd party cable try and swap it out with the Huawei one and see if that helps.

Even if you can use a stock looking icon pack, and have app drawer, or slap a launcher on it, some aspects of the phone are just too heavily themed. Like how they slaughtered the material design floating action button. But the performance is really faultless in my time with it. If I wanted a bigger screen phone, this would definitely be in my consideration. Where I live Huawei provides a more competitive warranty package too.\nS7 Edge would be my choice here, because it's just such a well rounded package for the most part. Camera and display is right at the top of the pack along with IP68. The software design is actually pretty decent too even on the Nougat beta. But, it's too far along in its cycle to me to get one now for me.

So, I thought I'd give the Mate 9 a shot.\nI'm happy that I could swap the buttons around to proper Samsung order, and I'll try to live without wireless charging. That's the really big loss for me. Not that I've researched if there are any wireless charging cover options for the Mate 9 yet -- though I looked for Mate 9 cases on Amazon, and nothing like that popped up there.\nSo far, things are mostly going OK -- my main beefs so far are about the lock screen, which I just want to do away with completely, and just go to the home screen when I wake the phone. So far, I haven't figured out how to get rid of the ultra-annoying \"magazine\" message, and having to swipe to get to the home screen. I just don't see any options that say \"turn that stuff off.\"\nOtherwise, I'm pretty impressed with the Mate 9.

Here are some other things I have noticed:\nMan, the screen is just SO much worse than the G7Edge screen. And again, it's not about \"resolution\" at all -- it's about contrast, viewing angles, and all that. It just looks very \"washed out\" in almost every situation I'd use it. It's not really something I notice when viewing pictures or videos -- which my initial thoughts were based upon -- but rather, by just using the phone, looking at normal text and such. The G7Edge screen is just in an entire different universe. Yes, the Samsung OLED screen is absolutely amazing.\nThe other thing I've noticed is how the Mate 9 \"buttons\" -- the home, back, and open apps buttons -- TAKE UP SCREEN SPACE, whereas they are BELOW THE SCREEN on the G7Edge. And in effect, the screen of the Mate 9 is NO TALLER AT ALL than the G7Edge screen. That wouldn't be the case for \"pictures\" and \"videos,\" but for apps, there just isn't more screen space with the Mate 9. The Mate 9 does give you a wider screen, so there's room for a bit more text there, but call the extra screen real estate kind of \"one-dimensional.\" In the end, there just isn't enough extra screen space to make the larger phone worth it.\nSo, that's where I am now.

I too owned a 6p and I personally loved it but ultimately it was returned for the Honor 8. I use two phones, one with a smaller to average size screen like the honor 8 and then I have become to like my second number phone or back up to be a large screen phone. I am looking at the Mate 9 very hard myself and at the moment if it weren't for my other expensive hobby with are high end automatic Swiss Dive Watches, I'd already have gotten the Mate 9. I'm trying to figure out a way to fit the current watch I want in with the current phone I want which is the Mate 9. I'm glad to read your review as I believe you chose a very good comparable device to give lots of 6p owners real world Mate 9 feedback. Excellent decision man. I know it helped me to only validate what my research and thoughts were of the Mate 9 already. Now I just need to talk myself out of this expensive watch to free up funds for the Mate 9. It's tough when you have two passions that get in the way of each other. I am always buying new phones and tablets trying them out but that has slowed down tremendously since I fell for the Honor 8. Now I have the Media Pad 3 from Huawei Honor that is every bit as good as the iPad pro 9.7 and lastly I recently as of this week won a Honor 5X from here on the forums without even knowing I was competing to win it! Lol. I was honored to be honored lol!! I just want that 5.9 inch screen so eventually whether it's tomorrow or a few weeks off, I will end up with the mate 9. Ironically before I saw or read your review or knew about the mate 9, I had planned on picking up a 64g 6p as instead of the 32g I used to own. Now I'm 100 percent sure I'm getting the mate 9. I strongly believe if Huawei stays their course, stays to their roots and loyal customers that within two more US based years of strong precense here that they will in fact surpass Samsung as the leading Android device amongst the ever growing tech crowd that has become widely aware of specs and who now have a better general understanding knowledge of what they are spec wise buying rather then solely buying the device name.

I tried to wait a few days because I often like a phone a lot while setting it up, only to find faults after using the phone a few days. I have used about every one of the top phones on the market (iPhone 7+, Pixel XL, S7 Edge, 6P, LG G5 and V20, HTC 10, Moto Z, One+3, Axon 7, etc.) and this is the best phone on the market right now, in my opinion. It has the best combination of size, screen, software, battery life and camera. \nScreen quality is always very important to me and I returned a number of phones because I could not stand the screen (LG I am looking at you). I was concerned about the 1080p, relatively low pixel density LCD screen, particularly considering the big 5.9 inch screen. In fact, I initially dismissed the thought of getting the Mate 9 for that reason. However, the screen is great. I can put it up next to the Pixel XL and look at the exact same things (pictures on 500 px, games, various apps) and rarely do I notice the difference between it and the AMOLED screen. It is much better than the smaller 1080p screens on the 7+, One+3, etc. I don't know how Huawei did it, but the screen is impressive considering the specs. \nThe battery is awesome. The software with Nougat flies. It has a much larger screen in the same size body as the iPhone 7+ and the Pixel XL. Connectivity has been good (bluetooth works better than the Pixel). It works well on AT&T -- of course HD Voice is not available. I have not taken many pictures yet, so I cannot really comment on the camera. \nI have a hard time finding fault with this phone.

First, this phone flies! It is the fastest phone I have used. I put it next to my Pixel XL and the Mate 9 is faster at everything it does. The UI is fast, but even the amount of time it takes from boot-up to syncing and downloading emails is amazingly fast. I use BB Hub and on every other phone it takes quite a while to download emails after the phone first starts up, but on the M 9 it is instantaneous. Email notifications are immediate. The quickness in downloading and installing updates from the Google Store is also amazing. There will be an occasional hiccup, just like I have experienced with every other Android phone, but it generally just flies. \nI like to switch between my 4 phones because I get bored (and i have the grass is greener syndrome), but I have a hard time using any of the others since I got the M9. I popped the SIM back in my S7 Edge and even with Nougat sideloaded on it, it is a serious dog compared to the M9. I cannot stand how slow it is at everything. It is hard to justify using the 7+ and XL with their smaller screens on bodies that are essentially the same size (only slightly narrower). The M9 screen blows away the iPhone screen and I really tried to compare the screens of the XL and M9 and had a hard time finding instances where the XL was noticeably better. \nConsidering that the M9 is significantly less expensive than those other phones, it is impressive.

It's the same when I click on the Settings button at the top of the notification panel and other areas such as the settings page.\nI thought it was just me but I've gone back to my Nexus 6P and iPhone 6s to test, and there is a notable difference.\nHas anyone else experienced this? \nDoes anyone know if this a known issue?

This screen is amazing! I can't get over how much nicer it is compared to the 6P and I can see it outside.

I definitely finish the day with more left over than the 6P but that's to be expected from its larger capacity.\nRadios: I get 4g in places that the 6P would not.\nSpeed: I had no issue with speed on the 6P but the mate 9 is snappier.\nSpeakers: another area that I felt was going to be a step backwards as the 6P has dual speakers. The mate 9 does a good job using the bottom speaker and the phone speaker to produce good sound.\nEMUI: after several years of vanilla Android I'm really enjoying this skin. \nFinger print reader: Damn that thing is fast and accurate!\nCamera: I haven't really had enough time to play with it yet so I can't really comment at this point (although I did take some very nice shots last night in manual mode, playing with iso and shutter speed.....I think I might pickup a mini tripod).\nThings I miss about my 6P:\nAmbient display: as I use my phone as my alarm clock, I miss not having the ambient display on at night to show me the time. I guess that's got to do with the difference in screen technology (LCD vs amoled).\nDo not disturb mode: on the mate 9 there's no option to automatically turn off do not disturb mode after the alarm goes off.\nLED notification light could be larger.\nSo far I'm really happy with this thing.", "time": "01-14-2017 07:14 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5643355", "text": "Settings : Fingerprint ID : touch to stop an alarms, touch and hold to answer calls. \nOther action settings on that page as well.", "time": "01-14-2017 07:32 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5649501", "text": "I thought about getting Pixel XL few times and by the time I really wanted to do it.

The way it handles the 2 SIM cards is odd. Samsung & HP have this licked and on first using the Mate 9 I kept seeing a recording logo in the top left of the display. I thought (incorrectly) it was an O2 recording. It wasn't - it was Sim no. 2 - on EE. How the hell so you get the message? There is no way of toggling between the Sims. I found a way, turn off making one sim or another being a default. That way you can (if you have bionic eye balls) see which SIM has a voice message waiting and select sim 1 or 2 accordingly to dial 901. Check out how simple (and obvious) it is on a Samsung Dual SIM Note 5 for example. \n2. The auto-brightness just doesn't work. It jumps up and down like a yo-yo and scrolls right back to minimum brightness in a low lit room. It is far too aggressive. \n3. Call Recorder Pro doesn't work. I'm hoping its a Nougat thing as the m9 is running Android 7. Let's hope so. \n4. Total finger magnet. I hate black phones but there is no choice with the Porsche Design version. \n6. The flimsy cheap looking case is poor. And because the PD Mate9 is relatively unique, there is no choice for others bar a Tonka-toy looking one from EBay/Mobile Fun if you want to pay quadruple from the latter supplier. \nIs it otherwise good?
