Hardly a small phone by any standard. \nAnyway i have a few things to say about this new Moto C phones. \n1. Why not blue color? I really like cyan or sapphire blue or some variation of blue. Why only gold, black, white and red? I want blue! \n2. Would have preferred a smaller screen but i see why they went with a big screen. Because bigger is always better and that's what sells these days but i would have been happy with even a 4.7\"display. \n3. 1gb ram? Is this 2014? Thankfully my country will get the 2gb ram variant so that's good. \n4. Am 100% sure Lenovo will not update this to Android O. \nYeah that's about it.
