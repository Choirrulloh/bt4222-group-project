It sounds like you know what to do if you can get the google keyboard back so I'll help you with that. Start fresh by restoring the device again. Now go to the wifi section. Type your wifi password and select advanced settings now make sure it's selected for manual with a proxy: privatoria.com and 3128 for port with dhcp still selected. Now connect. This will tell the phone it has wifi but it won't be able to communicate with google server. You notice that it keeps going to a screen that says can't connect but keep doing it and try to do it faster... it will take eventually.. I tried it on different wifi and a few times and it always skipped to the software update screen and then to passcode setup. At password setup select password..not passcode or passnumbers or pass swipping...words... choose something easy to remember. and then go through the whole process back to the main screen.

Here are the pros and cons:\nBlade Z Max\nPros:\n- Bigger battery (4000 vs. 3400 mAh)\n- Faster charging\n- Dual camera effects (bokeh and monochrome)\n- Android 7.1, slightly nicer, closer to stock Android\n- Nicer looking design on the back\nCons:\n- Slower Snapdragon 435 CPU vs. 617 on the Zmax Pro\n- FM Radio not working or crashing\n- Photo quality in low light is worse than the Zmax Pro\n- Dual camera is supposedly fake and 2nd lens not actually useable\n- Microphone quality is horrible, sounds very cheap compared to Zmax Pro (hear for yourself)\n- Loud speaker is worse than Zmax Pro\n- Cheap Chinese brand Asahi glass compared to Gorilla Glass 3 on Zmax Pro\nZmax Pro\nPros:\n- Faster Snapdragon 617 cpu\n- Better low-light performance compared to Blade Z Max\n- Shutter speed control in manual mode (disabled on Blade Z Max)\n- Microphone recording is very good\n- Costs cheaper since it's last year's\nCons:\n- Smaller battery\n- UI looks older, not 100% stock Android but very close\n- Back design looks very plain, an old design\n- Slower charging (but still has Quick Charge 2.0)\nOverall, the Blade Z Max has a bigger battery but a slightly slower processor and horrible low light camera and microphone. The Zmax Pro has a better low light camera and more manual controls for the camera. The microphone also sounds good on the Zmax Pro as well as the loudspeaker. If you're considering upgrading, you should consider these factors. Do you have the Blade Z Max? Let me know your thoughts. I've been thinking about buying it but after reaching, I'm having second thoughts.

I liked the Stylo 2 except its GPS had tendencies to need more time than normal to \"wake up\" when I wanted to use Maps (I leave location services ON but set to \"battery saving\" until I need directions at which time I switch it to \"HIGH\") and sometimes I even had to reboot it or else the GPS would do nothing at all. The ZTE Grand X Max 2 didn't have that issue and its big-screen experience was something else, but it was a pocketful to say the least.\nThe Grand X4 feels like a ZTE Grand X Max 2 \"downsized for sanity\" if you will. Its 5.5\" (with off-screen buttons) is to me the \"sweet spot,\" 5\" with on-screen buttons is just too small but 6\" with off-screen buttons is HUGE. It reminds me a lot of the ZTE ZMax 2 GoPhone I had last year, it was also a 5.5\" model with off-screen buttons and was a phone I felt that should've been updated to a ZTE ZMax 3 with Lollipop (and, coming up, a ZTE ZMax 4 with Nougat). You could say this is that phone (so long as you have Cricket, which I do).\nAlso, I've founds its battery life to be better than the ZTE Grand X Max 2 I had (although that one had perhaps been well-used) and its performance to be at least at the Stylo 2 level if not at the Grand X Max 2 level. I don't do hard-core gaming, but I can appreciate a phone that doesn't \"studder\" with everyday tasks, and I find it to run smoothly. I also like its usage of USB-C, I so appreciate the cord not being 1-way when you insert it. Also it seems to have the best signal strength, by a small margin, as I live in a rural area and it works probably the best of the 3 at home.

Also I almost forgot to mention that it won't let you update BusyBox either. I waited a very long time for this phone to acquire root but it's almost useless with the bootloader being locked. I can't even flash a recovery like CWM or TWRP.

My phone, an unrooted ZTE Grand Max 2 Z988 is having some trouble booting.\nThe phone has suffered no physical damage, so I can assure you it's not that.\nI read somewhere that disabling a certain apps that come pre-downloaded might cause some issues, but I'm afraid I forget where I read that;;\nFor a week, I know Touchpal 2017, a default keyboard on the phone displayed ads. You would open Snapchat or something and an ad would play. Or there would be banners on top of the notification screen. Or there would be half a circle on the side of your screen, and if you pressed it, and ad would pop up. Of course being the sane human being I am, I disabled the app as much as I could (as much as an unrooted phone could, anyway). I uninstalled all the Touchpal updates and didn't let it auto-update. I don't know if this is the cause of the problem but I thought I should let you guys know anyway.\nThe problem is, I'll turn it on, and the ZTE and Cricket splash intros (is that what they're called?) will play, but the phone will stay stuck on the cricket screen. Before this problem occurred, the app I was using crashed. Then, the launcher I was using crashed (Nova Launcher). It would ask me to choose a default launcher and if you did, it would crash immediately after and ask again. So I rebooted the phone to try to fix the problem. Of course that only made the problem worse;;\nHere's what I tried so far to fix the problem.\n-Turn it on and off. I get as far as the cricket screen and that's it.\n-Wiped the partition cache. From what I can tell the cache was cleared but it affected nothing. I'm still stuck on the cricket screen.\n-Reboot from a bootloader. I have no idea what that means or does, but at that point I was getting desperate. It didn't do anything either;;\n-Booted in safe mode. Or at least I think it's safe mode. All it shows is a gray box with the letters FTM in black times new roman. I couldn't do anything from there other than to reboot it again.\nThe most obvious solution is to factory reset, but there's photos and videos on there I really don't want to lose. I've tried connecting it to my PC but the PC doesn't recognize the device. If you don't know how to fix my phone, any way to recover my pictures and videos would be greatly appreciated. I tried to be as thorough as I could.

I noticed right away 2 issues that others also claimed to have and saw no fixes online. I have found a fix, or really more of a work around for these two issues, and wanted to share.\nThe first issue I noticed was the bluetooth chopping badly and playing back at faster speed and being almost inaudible in my car. After about 15 seconds of this my car would actually disconnect from the phone. I noticed in my driveway, where I could still pick up wifi, it played and worked fine. As soon as I got about 3 houses down and lost wifi and the phone switched to 4g the bluetooth would start cutting out and chopping badly. After trying a ton of settings, renaming the phone, deleting and setting the phone back up with my car, etc. I finally found what seems to be a fix. All I had to do was TURN OFF WIFI when I am not actually connected to wifi. As soon as I turn off wifi the bluetooth works perfectly and actually sounds great. With iheartradio in my Ford Focus with 'Sync' it sounds clearer and much better than my galaxy s5 and iphone 5s did. My wife told me when the phone switched during a phone call getting into my car that I acutally sounded clearer and louder when the car's bluetooth took over the call. When I want to connect to wifi I can turn it back on and bluetooth still works fine as long as I have a wifi signal. So for my phone at least, the problem seems to be using the network data with wifi turned on. I'm curious to see if this cures other peoples woes too.\nThe second problem I noticed was when I would get a group text or picture (any mms message) the phone would wake to the notification screen and would stay lit until I hit the power button to go back to sleep. It would stay lit for hours at a time. The work around I found was to ditch the stock messaging app and download google messenger (which I prefer anyway). Setting google messenger to the default messaging app fixed the issue for me, now the screen only stays lit for the set 15 seconds. I haven't noticed any issue with instagram or snapchat notifications. I haven't downloaded facebook to this phone yet so not sure about that one. I'm holding out as long as I can because the app is so invasive.\nI hope this helps. So far after fixing those two annoyances I am very happy with the phone. For $150, it is impressive and a good step above my most recent phone, a Galaxy S5.", "time": "02-08-2017 07:52 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5671508", "text": "Welcome to Android Central, and thanks for the tips!

I have selected the SD card as the save location, but nothing I download will actually save there. It all goes to the phone's internal storage, and while I can still manually move apps to the SD card, I can't download anything that is larger than the available internal storage space. Additionally, I frequently get the insufficient storage notification when I try to download apps, even when their download is size significantly smaller than the space available on the internal storage. For instance, when I try to download the game Dungeon Hunter 3, which has a download size of only 471MB, it tells me I have insufficient storage, even though it says I have 788MB available.\nI know the SD card is installed properly since I can move apps to it and it has music saved on it. I've only downloaded a few apps and I've moved all of them to the SD card. I have no movies or music stored internally, and I've deleted all but 10 of the pics saved to my phone. The SD card is not locked and does not have any secure storage. I've cleared the cached data multiple times and I've gone into the file manager and deleted a bunch of ad videos and images that other apps had saved to my phone. And yes, I have tried turning it off and on again. Many times. XD \nI've seen some people talking about \"rooting\" in various posts about memory problems, but I have no idea what that is and am very new to Android devices..\nTwo other, somewhat related problems are that any time a downloaded app updates, it moves itself back to the phone and I have to go in and move it back to the SD card. Even more strangely, is that whenever I restart or turn off my phone, all of the downloaded app icons disappear from all of my home screen pages, whether or not they are on the SD card or internal memory.

Apps always have to download and install to Internal Storage first, after which the user can try to move a portion of the app to the SD card (if the device supports moving the app--and not all devices support this).Keep in mind that the download size shown in Google Play Store is only the size of the installer file. The full app usually requires substantially more internal storage (just like a Windows program's final size on the hard drive is significantly larger than the EXE file). And there is also a threshold available space below which the system prevents you from installing anything (since the system always has to make sure a certain amount of storage is available for various system apps as well).Rooting a phone is the process of obtaining superuser status, allowing you to have more control over the system. It can give the user much more power, but it's also not for beginners, since doing the wrong thing can brick the phone. Also, in your situation, the main way that rooting would help would be if the phone didn't support moving apps to SD in the first place, because then you could use apps like Link2SD or App Mgr III (which require root).This is normal behavior.This is not normal behavior.

If you must have your apps running from the card, root and run External 2 Internal SD (Root) - it swaps the internal and external storage, so if you have, say 4GB of internal storage and a 32GB card, you now have 32GB of \"internal\" storage and a 4GB \"card\".)", "time": "01-21-2016 01:06 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5121578", "text": "I got ZTE Obsidian from Tmobile.

So I decided to transfer to VZW towers and bought a highly-recommended phone at WALMART Called the ZTE DUO MAX LTE.\nI cannot for the life of me figure out how to enable smart gestures-- basically on the THL5000 I could swipe up to wake up & unlock the phone, or just double tap to wake up the phone (displaying the lock screen. ) -- I have tried a million things and no joy. I even found a few posts on this very forum saying I needed to buy the NovaPrime Launcher and that would enable gestures. I spent the $5 bucks, and it does enable gestures, but only after the phone is awake and unlocked! Nothing will awaken it when the screen is off, which I highly highly prefer to pushing the power button every time. Now I don't care if I have to slide or swipe or tap, but one of them should do it, if possible. ?...\nIs there anyway I can do this?

For apps that don't give you this option, you can select the app in the Data Usage menu and tap Restrict Background Data (or you can universally Restrict Background Data, but this might make you miss things like important app notifications).\nThis guide might be generally useful for you: http://forums.androidcentral.com/gen...-lollipop.html", "time": "10-27-2015 07:03 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Any Forums For The AT&T ZTE ZMAX 2", "thread": [{"postID": "post4775885", "text": "Any out there??", "time": "10-26-2015 05:26 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "How do I open downloads off a ZTE 4G fit phone?", "thread": [{"postID": "post4770850", "text": "I downloaded a exercise program off the internet and cannot open it.

First, I found that I had a .nomedia file in the root directory of my sd card. Before making changes, I unmounted it, backed it up to my desktop via a card reader, deleted that file, and remounted it. After that, all three audio player apps on the phone would play audio files selected using the file manager. (Not sure if that was due to deleting .nomedia or just unmounting/mounting the card - maybe the latter is more likely). However, I still couldn't see any files in the library of any of the three players. \nJetAudioBasic has an option to rebuild the library from a specified directory. From there, I was able to see and specify the music folder on the sd card. It appeared to be thinking about doing something when I clicked OK, but no new files appeared in the library.\nThen I downloaded an sd card scanner app. It scanned the card, and I could see it listing some of the audio files as it showed scanning progress. But no new audio files appeared in any of the libraries. \nFinally, not knowing what else to do, I just downloaded a new audio player, PowerAmp (free trial version). It found all my audio files, on both internal memory and sd card. Everything plays fine. \nI'm still wondering why this happened. And I'm curious as to whether it will happen again if I sync more music to the card (maybe the new music won't show up).

Right now, if I try to use the \"Search for Updates\" on the phone, it reboots the phone and I get a error notification, which I assume is due to the rooting.\nSo, I come to thee, to help me on my quest.

Device slow-downs, anything?What's the best way to root your phone after said update?What must have apps, launchers, ROM thingies (not even sure what a ROM is just heard about it (and everywhere in the world smart smartphone people cringed hard))Can I get my SD card to store apps etc?

Chance are your sensor is dirty, it may not look too bad but these sensors are sensitive and sometimes it only takes a little bit of grim, from makeup, sweat, or your pocket to cause it to act up. Do you have a screen protector on the device that also covers the sensor? Screen protectors are natorious for turning colors, brown, yellow, etc., and just being able to see through the protector doesn't garantee that it can see you back. If you have a screen protector that you can remove just the bit that covers the sensor try that, clean the face of the phone up real well including the sensor, or remove the cover your screen protector is attached to and see if that doesn't put function back into your device. I will also add that these sensors don't usually go bad, but when they do usually fail on or off, so they either think they are seeing light when they are not or they never see the light, I think I know a few people like that, but anyway by shining a light at it and it working shows that something is blocking the light dark signal and the sensor is working.

I found the instructions for Framaroot at click here for link I followed the instructions and when I click on \"Aragorn\" or \"Gandalf\" I get the following error messages bellow.\nAragorn\nFailed :-(...try another exploit if available (error #6)\nGandalf\nFailed :-(...try another exploit if available (error #5)\nWhat gives? I followed the instructions. What does the error numbers mean? I can't find any reference to error numbers 5 and 6. I can do a screen capture and past if need be.

I assume that you mean you get 1200 of each of those items per month, correct?\nMobile phone minutes refer only to calls you make. The 1200 mb of data is when you're connected to 3G or 4G and sending or receiving data. Remember that you don't have to be actively doing anything to have your phone use data, since it is often doing some background syncing and updating. If you use wifi to connect to the web, then your mobile data connection should turn off temporarily, thus preventing you from using up more of your data allotment, but this doesn't always happen depending on the phone. In this situation, it is often a good idea to turn off your 3G/4G connection while on wifi to ensure that you're not using up your mobile data.\n1.2 GB of data per month is fairly average for the moderate user. If you plan on streaming a lot of music or videos while not on a wifi connection, then you might need more.\nGPS itself does not use mobile data, but apps that use the GPS can use mobile data (like, for example, Google Maps). GPS isn't entirely necessary unless you need a precise location--without GPS, the phone can triangulate your position within reasonable accuracy (say, around 1000 feet) using the cell towers or the wifi address.\nPlease be aware that the ZTE Valet is very much an entry-level phone. Its specs (ZTE Valet Specs, Features (Phone Scoop)) say that it has 512 MB of system RAM, which is pretty low these days (most phones have at least 1 GB, and high end phones have 2 GB). Low RAM means fewer apps can stay in memory, which means more sluggish performance and app switching. It also only has 4 GB of onboard storage ROM, of which only 2.3 GB is available to you. This storage ROM is the only area where you can install apps, so it will limit how many apps you can install, and how big they are. Inserting an external microSD card will not allow you to install more apps--it's mainly good for storing media files, like music, photos, videos, etc. If you can afford it, and if these things are important to you, I would suggest finding a phone with at least 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of storage ROM.\nGood luck!", "time": "12-05-2013 01:16 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post3297943", "text": "Thanks B.

Is there anything I can do or clean out to avoid this restarting? \nSent from my Nexus 7 using AC Forums mobile app", "time": "03-08-2014 09:09 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post3510986", "text": "U can add a larger memory SD card that should help\nPosted via Android Central App", "time": "03-14-2014 01:38 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "ZTE SAVVY Messaging Alerts", "thread": [{"postID": "post3503653", "text": "Does anyone know how to get the zte savvy phone to alert you when you receive a text message?

Even the store owners cannot get access to cases and they say I could be out of luck because it is a limited release phone. \nThis phone is very slick, as in, it will slip out of your hand very easily.

Every other camera-related app that I have downloaded is able to find and use the camera to suit its purposes, with the exception of QR Code and the First Community Credit Union check scanning app. The problem with those apps is not in finding the camera, but in focusing it. Since the ZTE Valet has only a single rear facing camera, it cannot focus clearly on something as close to the lens as a check or a QR code. However, Viddy, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, MapMyWalk, GifBoom and GIF Camera have no problems.\nWhat's up with Vine? I'd like to believe that it is just a question of an update and the problem with Vine will be solved. Would that suggest that the developers of the other apps I mentioned were more forward thinking than the Vine developers and sort of pre-updated their apps before the introduction of the ZTE Valet? Or does it suggest that MOST apps don't require an update to deal with a new camera phone on the market, but that Vine is somehow diffferent aand does reqire that last tweak?
