Oh, noes!\nLuckily, there was no damage to the operation of the phone - it unlocked as normal and I saw no visible damage to the screen. However, when I locked my phone and examined the now-turned-off screen, I had two big cracks along the middle of the screen. Sad! But my tempered glass screen protector saved the day! That kind of a fall would have definitely damaged my screen had it not been protected.\nI'm a little worried that there could be some damage to my actual screen; but I think my screen protector is thick enough that that probably isn't the case. Even though I'm hoping to get a new phone soon, I love my Honor 8 and want to keep it as a worthy alternative and backup device; so having it in good condition means a lot to me.\nGood to know that my paranoia of my precious phones breaking on me sometimes comes in handy!", "time": "03-19-2018 01:44 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6196870", "text": "Glad that the tgsp did its job!

If I use Snapchat with 80% battery or lower it restarts my phone right away. When restarted, it tells me I have the same % as before but if I then open Snapchat again it restarts my phone again and tells me I have anywhere between 1% to 30% left (any number between there is essentially the same, though) and I have to charge it. If I let it run without using Snapchat it dies at around 65%.\nI've been googling for a few days trying to fix it without luck. Most search results circle around similar problems with the Nexus 6, but nothing on Honor 8.

After that, I ran into the oddest of issues, including 1) Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and NFC radios not working 2) the phone factory resetting itself in the middle of the night 3) the mysterious disappearance of the Downoads and Smart Remote apps 4) Honor support claiming my IMEI and serial number didn't exist 5) random bootloops 6) the camera defaulting to monochrome, and a host of other less significant issues. I was utterly bewildered as to how a single drop could cause all these problems, especially the ones that seem to be purely software-based. The last straw for me was when the Honor 8 wiped itself (the day before my final exams, too), so, with resignation, I ordered a Moto X4 prime edition.\nMy time with the Moto X4 was grudgingly tolerative. I noticed every slow animation caused by the lesser processor, and frowned at the weaker battery life. But most of all, I missed that Huawei camera. I longed for the perfect photos I would get out of my Honor 8. Alas, since Honor took down the recovery files, I was no longer able to restore my phone's firmware. I logged off of these forums and went through my life.\nBut then, inspiration came to me in the early hours of the morning. I used HiSuite and updated my Honor 8 to the latest security patch, and suddenly, it was back to normal. Everything was and is currently working perfectly. Support still tells me my phone doesn't exist, but maybe it's better that way. Maybe Huawei doesn't need to know that I brought my phone back to life.\nIn any case, I am back!\nLumi Valo", "time": "02-04-2018 09:47 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6154640", "text": "Glad to hear that you are back!", "time": "02-05-2018 12:06 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6155418", "text": "^_^", "time": "02-05-2018 09:37 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post6155403", "text": "Welcome back to the shiny world of Honor 8!", "time": "02-05-2018 09:16 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6155419", "text": "^_^", "time": "02-05-2018 09:37 PM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"title": "Google Play Services Killing My Battery....

I ask because EMUI is a lot like IOS as I sit here and type this I remember back very clearly that EMUI is really very similar to IOS. I believe it\u2019s why some of us like EMUI due to how smooth and fluid the software is much like IOS. Plus settings are a lot like IOS. I can tell you guys I\u2019m so excited to have my iPhone back. Today I found a Black Friday sale on a iPad Pro 9.7 which I owned in 2016 which now the 10.5 inch pro took its place. I wanted that 10.5 inch pro and actually bought it but I took it back thinking I needed to be more practical and save money and got the current iPad 9.7 which does not support the Apple Pencil and way less features. Well today I found a iPad Pro 9.7 inch 256g cellular on amazon where they had it on sale for $699!! That\u2019s not that much more than what I paid for my current iPad with way less features which I never even pulled the plastic off of. I\u2019m taking it back tomorrow and returning it and picking up the Apple Pencil again with a red pencil case. I\u2019ll take lots of notes with the pencil and the iPad Pro has True Tone display, more power and four sets of stereo speakers. Also it\u2019s built with a better screen which is anti glare and there is no gap between the screen and underside of the internal part of the iPad. In other words it\u2019s far superior built than the current iPad that I had bought but thankfully never even opened it up as I just knew I wanted that discontinued iPad Pro 9.7 2016 model which is basically just like the new 10.5 inch iPad Pro. Plus I\u2019ve got two keyboard cases I ordered for it coming and a regular case without a keyboard. \nI have to care for my sick mother and take her to the doctor almost daily while she gets her radiation and chemo treatments so I\u2019ll be able to take my iPad Pro with me while I wait in the waiting room on her and have internet access as I got the cellular model. At $699 for a iPad Pro 9.7 with 256g is an awesome deal! Still expensive but compared to what it would have cost me last year it\u2019s a rock bottom price. I probably saved $250 to $300 bucks today on that iPad Pro. I\u2019m looking forward to the two Keyboard cases I ordered for it too. I like making my ipads turn into mini laptops which is why I ended up ordering two of them. I\u2019ve is more heavy and one more slim and thin. They arent cheap but Black Friday helped me out on them as they were on sale. \nSo anyways how many of you given the great opportunity would let their honor 8 go to get the new iPhone 8.

I really appreciate the help too bc overall I like both IOS and Android for both of their different reasons and features. When Honor releases its next flagship I will no doubt be tempted but I finally had made the promise to myself that I would settle down to one phone and I knew it would be very expensive to switch back to apple having to buy an iPhone unlocked so the only reason I switched back over was due to the opportunity I had gotten through Xfininty and the $500 dollar gift card offer and being able to finance my iPhone. The gift card basically aid for my iPad Pro that I\u2019m typing this on right now. So a lot went my way for me to actually be even able to make swap back over and had I not been able to I would have been very happy to have kept my honor 8 too. \nI ordered the same keyboard case that I used to use with my last iPad Pro which is the Targus 4 in 1 Smart Keyboard and this thing is awesome. It truly turns my pro into a mini laptop. The only feature it doesn\u2019t have is back lit keys which I can live without. The srceen swivels in all different directions and can even be turned totally around to lay flush to the keyboard turning it back into just a tablet too without having to take it out of the case. I ordered one other keyboard case from Logitech but I\u2019m not sure if ill end up keeping it or not. I got it on sale for Black Friday as its slimmer and more thin than my Targus so I will have to see how sturdy it ends up being.\nAnyways i was just curious if any of you would ever consider IOS like myself being that EMUI is a lot like IOS in some ways or another. Even though I\u2019m a apple die hard i still hold much respect for android unlike a lot I\u2019ve seen who don\u2019t on the iMore forums. I guess really that doesn\u2019t truly make me a true die hard apple as i would have no problem switching back again some day but as for right now it was so much trouble and effort getting my iPhone 8 and new iPad Pro that I don\u2019t even want to think about buying another phone for while lol. My step brother needs a phone really bad so I\u2019m going to give him my new axon 7 so he can have a good phone as his is really old and right now he doesn\u2019t even have service.

Auto rotate stopped working, compass app stopped working and the phone did not turn on when done with a call and pulling it away from my face to end call. So, I called Honor and they had me send my phone back to Texas for repair under warranty as my phone had 1 month left on warranty. It was returned to me without repair and a note stating that it had liquid damage. I called customer service and 100% disputed that it had liquid damage, but beyond that it was returned with more issues than it had when I sent it in. The back of the phone is coming off, the camera is completely blurry and the fingerprint id feature under the settings menu is gone. I have a fingerprint reader, but no fingerprint id in the settings menu. So, now the phone is for the most part completely useless.\nI have contacted Honor at least 6 times and they tell me that it is being \"escalated\" but nobody ever gets back to me. The customer service # is just a call center in Mexico and they cannot do anything. They keep saying that they are waiting for info back from the repair center....but they never have any info. They just keep telling me that the phone has water damage and they don't even address the fact that it was sent back to me in a much worse condition than when it was sent in. So, it sounds like my issue is the same as what you are experiencing. I'm assuming that Huawei (Honor) has a policy at the repair center to state that any phone returned has water damage so they don't have to repair them. At this point I don't know what to do.", "time": "09-07-2017 11:11 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5963893", "text": "Thank you for the reply. The experience you have described is indeed very much like mine. In my case, it started with a series of strange behavior, like \"Charging other device via USB\" notification, not responsive \"Smart Key\", random launch of applications set to be opened with the smart key, and ended with the power button not working, fingerprint sensor issue, and most recently some pictures taken being only partially recorded. The customer service is not helpful at all. One representative tried to convince me that the decision of the liquid damage has been made based on the pictures of the phone that I have sent them. The other mentioned about a humidity sensor being active as the phone was opened (but it seems like they do not keep a record of that). Yet another logic offered was that the service center would rather repair the device than reject for any reason, because it is the only way for them to get paid. I do not know if it is true, but it is also possible that they are not able to keep up with repair requests, so that they choose to reject some. The fact that they introduce additional damage during the service is just so wrong.\nAt this point, I requested a written resolution on my ticket (which is pending since 7/10/2017), basically an official statement regarding Huawei Device USA position. It is something that the complaints department promised to deliver after the phone was returned from the repair, which was more than a month ago. Yesterday I spoke about this with a customer service supervisor, who ensured that the letter will be sent out by the end of the day, putting the ticket to bed. Not surprisingly, that was not the case, and yet again they are asking to wait additional 48-72 hours. I really have no idea what else can be done at this point. Hopefully the resolution letter may bring some ideas.

In my case I can say with 100% conviction that my phone never touched water. However, it is my word against the \"qualified technician\" at Huawei's repair center in Texas. However, these are the same technicians that sent my phone back with further problems. I also find it strange the the customer service center is actually not a customer service center, it is merely a call center located in Mexico with the repair center a 3rd part vendor located in Texas. The customer service center has no authority to do anything, to find any resolution. So, I'm actually not sure why they even have it, other than to provide customers with an address to the repair center in Texas.\nI wonder how many other people out there have been told their phone has \"liquid damage\" and cannot be repaired under warranty. Based on my experience so far, and based on the warranty logistics model that Huawei has in place in the U.S; I am starting to think that the \"liquid damage\" finding is standard practice for their warranty protocol so that they do not have to fix phones.\nI have filed a complaint with the BBB and will start contacting Huawei at every phone number they list until I get someone on the phone. If Huawei wants to actually create a footprint in the United States by selling their products here, they have a lot to do with respect to customer service. They should take a look at when Best Buy first came to China and folded....because they didn't understand the Chinese market.

Just give them two years after coming to the US and I think they will be neck and neck with Samsung or have already taken the number one spot but however I do think to do this that they need to continue to release at least one honor flagship phone here a year and one Huawei flagship phone here a year until they are officially here so that they continue to keep spreading their brand recognition. That's the part that will hurt them if they stop releasing both phones here before they enter. They are due for both Huawei the honor but there is a lot of speculation that they won't release another honor flagship here. That would be a very bad business decision if they were not to release another flagship from the honor side. I think they already have confirmed that the mate 10 will be a US market release so now they need to spring the news of an honor flagship release next which will only help them long term here. The honor 8 has just about played out so it's time so I guess in the next two or three months we shall see what they plan to do. I hope they don't make a bad decision. I really like Huawei Honor. They are by far my favorite company for smart phones.

It simply does not exist. I know I just bought my third honor 8 now have owned black, blue and now Pearl but this time in a 64g which I bought mine as a open box from B&H and I talked them down to where I only had to pay $199 for a new 64g honor 8.

What do you think honor will release in terms of a flagship honor device to take the place of the honor 8? I'm beginning to think that the US will not see another honor flagship here until they officially enter in to the US which is at the very least two years away. By then if I have to wait that long for another good honor device they will have lost my business and I'm one of Huawei Honors biggest fans I know that. They make incredible superior devices at great prices. They are in fact definitely superior to Samsung except for the screen resolution area but their software is tens times smoother than that of Samsung. They make in-house processors which are very powerful and optimized extremely well. Their camera on the honor 8 easily competes with Samsung being that they are noted to have probably the best on the market. I'm just very unsure we will actually see anything else flagship wise from the honor side to take the honor 8s place now.

I\u2019ve owned Sony. Their updates are about average or typical in terms of how often they update. I know some of you pointed out the Red HTC which was awesome looking. I wouldn\u2019t have minded getting one of those while I was using android but I was more into Motorola phones. I liked the Moro Z line. The Moto mods were fun to mess around with as you could change the look of your phone every day. My favorite moto z was the budget Z phone which was the Z Play. Absolutely the best battery I\u2019ve ever used. It lasted forever and barely drained. Another awesome semi budget phone I loved was the Nexus 6p. Had it not been for it\u2019s 5.7 inch huge design I would have used that phone a lot longer. I just personally prefer a smaller compact phone as my daily driver. That being said I absolutely love being back to the iPhone which their design has been the same since the iPhone 6 all the way up to even now with the iPhone 8 which is 4.7 inch display. One thing I can tell you I do every day and all the time is I try to unlock my new iPhone from the back lol. I got so used to the Honor 8 fingerprint sensor being on the back I find that I\u2019m always pressing my apple logo to try and unlock my phone all the time. Lol. It\u2019s been hard getting used to the front bottom fingerprint sensor again. I\u2019m not really sure which I like better front or back. The iPhone 8 fingerprint sensor is way more fast than the 6s which was the last iPhone I used before swapping over to android. I\u2019d say the iPhone 8 and Honor 8 are neck and neck in terms of how fast they unlock the phone. I\u2019ve always thought the Honor 8 had one of the most fastest fingerprint sensors on the market and also one that always worked on the first try every time too. I know I\u2019m going to miss the days of the mid range budget phones that still offered flagship specs like the Honor 8. The iPhone 8 is a flagship and the price definitely reflects it too. That\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t want to do again was pay top dollar for a phone again but never say never bc here I am as I\u2019ve done it again now with the iPhone 8. The only way I justified it was that I promised myself that I\u2019d use it for long term and not continue to change phones or buy and sell all the time anymore. Had it not been for the promotion xfibity had I wound have never gone back to apple lije I just did but if I was going to go back the promotion I got made it the best time to go ahead and make the switch back worth it and even possible. I still though hated to let my Honor 8 go as I always thought it was the best device on the market for the price. To me it\u2019s very much a flagship device but at an unbelievable price. I truly think had the Honor 9 had been released here that I would not have swapped back over to apple.

However, when I try to delete a new photo I took with the phone, I get the following message:\nI assume this means photos taken with the camera are being stored on the SD card I put into the phone? I guess that is good because it is what I wanted to happen but had no idea how to make happen in the settings.

I have gone into the app settings for Google Photos and given it permission to every setting allowed, including \"storage\", but it still gives me this message.

I could be way off but I feel like this is what we may in fact see. Time will definitely tell as I think honor will release something early December before Christmas sales is my thinking. Again it's hard to get a read on it since huawei honor are hardly even in the US anyway. I just know how good the honor 8 is so I definitely hope their next US release will be another upper end Honor phone which to me is barely short of any other current model flagship out there today.

In fact that's all they are doing is taking away from the width and adding it to how tall it is. Watching a movie on that ratio is out of proportion badly. Even Huawei honor has adopted it in one of their mate 10 models I was not happy to see. The mate 10 pro version will have the non sense 18.9 inch ratio is where the regular mate 10 will keep the typical and much better proportioned 16.9 inch ratio.

Lol over the full year I lived there I ended up getting four speeding tickets only on my trips back and forth from MS to AL and vice versa. Lol. Before that I had never gotten a speeding ticket. I'm surprised my license didn't get suspended lol. Three were in AL and one was in MS. Each time I was going between 95mph and 100mph lol. When I take long trips on open interstate I tend to have a heavy foot lol. Those tickets could have easily bought me a flagship phone!!

I've slowed it down now or I try to be aware of it. I've owned several sport cars over my years and the fastest I ever got up to was 155mph but I did with no one around me and on open highway on a straight away. I got a huge rush out of it but even I became a little nervous moving that fast lol. I've never done it again since that one time. I was just curious to see how my Camaro handled at a high speed. Felt like I was only going 65mph it handled so well. I will say though that I never ever went that fast in my Vette bc it's so back end light. The Vette will fishtell on you in a second bc it's a lot lighter than the heavy camaro which just gets lower to the ground the faster you go thus giving you an excellent handling experience. I have a hard time driving slow in a car if it handles well or performs well at higher speeds. I'm not a wreckless driver and I drive fast in select situations but it's just so easy to look down and be at 100 before you know it in a sports car that's made to perform it's best at high speeds plus since they handle so well you don't even realize you've gotten up to 100 unless you happen to check which then I back off pretty quick. Before last year I had never gotten any tickets but that full year traveling back and forth from out of state got me 4 tickets during that span and they were expensive too. I've learned my lesson for sure.

Most of all, it broke my non-Google calendar, which already made me not as much of a fan about this update. Tried a number of free calendars with no luck. I need my calendar. \nSince it worked before on EMUI 4.1/Android 6.0, I decided to download the official rollback update from the HiHonor support website. I followed the directions about removing the file into the dload folder (or if there isn't one, create it) on internal storage. I did the button combo the first time and I saw \"update successful\". Tried it again to do the next step and it didn't work, as it kept saying that the software update couldn't be found so it failed. \nIt kept failing so I went back to the directions. I tried to reload the file to see if that would do anything but it seemed not to work still. Then I did the worst thing ever without knowing it. I factory reset my phone with the file still in it and it broke my phone essentially. Somehow doing that broke the keyboards. The only available keyboard is a voice keyboard, which you can't even work with, because of passwords and such. \nI have wiped the cache partition a few times throughout all of this, along with more factory/hard resets. No matter what, I only have a voice keyboard so now my Honor 8 is now a $300 paperweight. \nSince I registered my phone, I'll see if Honor can do anything for me with their support but as for now, I'm tired. I have tried various things and I have lost a couple of nights trying to make this work.

I don't typically use cases so if you are like I am and would rather not use a case all the time this maybe something you will like. It's offered in 16 different colors! I personally ordered two of them. I ordered the Beat Orange for my Axon 7 and the Beat Red for my new Sony Xperia X Performance I just bought which by the way I had it narrowed down to between the Sony which was their flagship device in 2016 and the Honor 8. I got such a good deal on the Sony with it having the 820 processor and it being exactly 5 inches that I decided to go for it over the beloved honor 8. Anyways the inner lining of this sleeve by FitBag is like a microfiber cloth. It's very protective for your phone and would be perfect for the honor 8 which when I do get another one I'll be ordering this sleeve for mine. The other two colors I liked was the Beat Blue and Beat Yellow but they had 16 colors overall to choose from. They aren't cheap as they run about $25 bucks a piece but give you full protection. Lately when I use a case it's been folio style cases so these sleeves were perfect for me. Here's a couple pictures of them. Mine are on the way and I believe they are hand made and they come from Germany. Here's a pic of the Beat Orange and Beat Red which the Beat Red would be the color I'd order for the Honor 8 when I get another one.

I chose the 32g as I found an open box on B&H for only $199. So I just made an even exchange with my Sony Xperia X. They are shipping it tomorrow for Saturday delivery. I've got my screen protector ordered plus I'm probably going to order a Red Carbon Fiber Dbrand skin for the back although I still have quite a few cases left over from my previous two times owning this device. I've almost tried out just about every Android phone out there and what I love about the honor 8 is the EMUI software that is nothing remotely like stock Android. It's totally different and unique which I love it. I don't use any type of third party launcher on my honors as I love the layout of EMUI. Oh here's a picture of the Skin I'm thinking of ordering. I've gotten to where I hardly ever use a case anymore unless it's a flip folio case which I might try and locate one of those for this honor 8 I'm getting on Saturday. So I sent the Xpreria X back to B&H today and they said since they can track it that would go ahead and send out my honor 8 right now in advance. The only thing I had to pay in addition was $25 bucks for Saturday delivery. I found an open box honor 8 on B&H so it only ran me $199. I thought that was a steal on this device being that it's just about a flagship phone in every sense of a word. It's the best phone you can buy for the price. I found the camera is one of the very best out there and I've tested out a lot of different phones as you guys know. The honor 8 camera spoiled me in comparison to all the other phones I've been through so I've decided this time around that the honor 8 will become my daily driver for long term and I'm not planning on buying any other phones for a while. I've been through so many now and I have always came back to the honor 8 every time. This is the phone for me definitely.", "time": "10-27-2017 04:24 AM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"postID": "post6041070", "text": "Welcome back!

The good thing is all I had to order for the honor 8 was a two pack tempered glass screen protector as I've got a slew of cases for it left over from my previous two times with the honor 8. I'm thinking though that I'll probably just use a dbrand skin for it mainly now as I've gotten to where I don't like using a case anymore bc it adds so much bulk to the phone. I like a phone to feel sleek and small in my hand and cases just adds too much bulk but on the other hand I know I'm asking for trouble if I were to drop it.

The Nexus 6p was not far behind the Axon 7 either but the speaker on the honor is average at best but everything else is truly flagship level. I've seen many times before where the Kirin 950 has been compared to the Snapdragon 820 which even today is still a flagship processor that is very fast. The only other phone that comes close to competing pretty good with the honor 8 is indeed the Axon 7. But then you have to keep in mind screen size as not everyone wants a 5.5 inch phone to be their daily driver and vice versa. Some think the 5.2 inch honor 8 is too small and should have been 5.5.

How many of you have ever encountered a faster fingerprint sensor? I know personally I've gone through so many phones over the past year and a half that I'm embarrassed but out of all those phones not one came close to the accuracy and speed of the honor 8s fingerprint sensor. It's simply unbelievable. It's a pleasure to use and to top it off it can programmed to function in three different manners. My one press activates my flashlight. My double press takes a screen shot. My long press opened up AC forums. Then you even have the option to pull down your notifications. Tell me how the fingerprint sensor alone is not one of the best if not the best out there over any flagship device. It utterly destroys the Samsung S8 fingerprint sensor. I'll even say this. Other than screen resolution of the S8 I could not see any performance difference between the S8 and Honor 8. The honor 8 was 5 times more smooth and fluid then the $750 dollar S8. The only thing the S8 was better than the Honor 8 in was the amazing screen resolution that Samsung flagships are known for but saying that the honor 8 even though it's not an amoled screen has a very good vibrant and punchy colors for just a 1080p HD screen. Meaning you can't even tell the honor 8 does not have an AMOLED display. It's just hard to prove this phone is not a full flagship bc every flagship has at least one or two weaknesses. Mentally though I have a hard time considering the honor 8 to be a full all out flagship when I think of it's price but you take the price out of the equation and look at it from a spec stand point and right now I'm comparing it to the S8 which we all know is a full blown flagship and I owned it for a little while but I saw really no difference between the two at all.

That's what actually makes me struggle with calling it a flagship or not is the price and I know it shouldn't bc the specs speak for themselves.

Thanks for wanting to keep me around. This by far is the best forum on the AC forums I've ever used and I've been on quite a few different ones over the past year and a half or so. This forum is a very tight nit group here with everyone being big time positive and overall nice and respectful. I've definitely enjoyed all the interaction here and I've learned a lot along the way. I also hoped that helped people as much as I've learned. I always try to respond to the new comers on here when they have a question or make a post. I of course nowhere near know everything but I do know quite a bit about the honor 8 and EMUI. It's by far been the biggest part of Android during my year and a half I've now that had been using Android exclusively. I'll most definitely now well I'll probably pretty much go back exclusively to apple now as I've been wanting to go back for about the last 6 months but really had not seen any good opportunities to be able to until this Xfinity mobile $500 dollar gift card hit me out of nowhere. I never in a million years ever even thought about using Xfinity as my mobile phone carrier. Just so happen I got that mailer in the mail and I mainly called just to only sign up for internet and cable as even Xfinity mobile told me that they are very new to the mobile part and are taking it slow as they enter in the mobile side of the industry. They said that's why they don't offer any tablets and only offer apple and Samsung only. Kind of weird how things work out and hit you when you least expect it. They even approached me about the mobile part as I never even thought to ask them about their mobile side when I originally called in. So initially I kind of wrote it off as I really didn't intend to have any interest then it hit me and someone advised me to call them back about that $500 gift card promotion bc at first I signed up for a plan that didn't qualify me to get it. So when I called back I started to ask questions and one of main concerns was about their service coverage and what towers they used. When they told me Verizon towers that's when I really sparked a heavy interest in to the possibility of using them as my mobile carrier bc I loved cricket. Verizon always has good reception and coverage being the largest carrier so that was really what made me decide to proceed with the entire idea and eventual switch that I made today. They only offer two plans which is pay $12 bucks per gig you use which is what I signed up for and $45 dollars for unlimited data until you hit 20 gigs then at that point your speed slows down until the next month. The only time I've ever gone over 20 gigs was this month when I moved in to care for my mom who as you all know was diagnosed with stage 4 terminal lung and bone cancer. She didn't have any internet or cable so I only used my unlimited data with cricket and I was amazed at how fast I reached 20 gigs of data well before the month was over. So that's how I ended up calling Xfinity in the first place as I had to get some WiFi here and internet. I don't really care about the cable as I only got that for my mom to have so she can be able to watch better TV and I wanted her to enjoy the possible short time that she may or may not have left with me sadly. Hopefully she will beat it but it's going to take a miracle medically speaking as stage 4 medically means there is no chance for survival and full remission from it. I can tell you it's so difficult to watch your mom go through so much pain as of we all know how special mom's are to all of us. There is nothing in this world like your mother. They are indeed without doubt the most special people in this world. I just tell her all the time she's going to be okay and beat it and stay positive around her but it breaks my heart although I don't let her know as I need her to mentally stay positive as they plays a huge role in prolonging their inevitable death sentence for the lack of better words. Anyways so now I'm officially a Xfinity mobile customer. I'm going to try this pay by the gig plan first as I'm here at the house 98 percent of the time caring for her so I'll be on wifi for all of that time so in theory if I don't use one entire gig all I'm paying for is the monthly cost of my phone which is cheaper than what I was paying with cricket which was $55 per month for unlimited data. I have a feeling though as time goes on that I'll switch over to their $45 dollar unlimited plan but I want to pay the phone off first to save money. I really wanted to use that gift card to pay my phone off but I've been needing to get another iPad so that is what I'll buy with the gift card money. Hopefully the 9.7 inch iPad pro which I'll put on a cheap $30 dollar plan per month then.", "time": "11-16-2017 08:30 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6073587", "text": "Of course we want to keep you around!

I have to totally wing it and let if flow from the heart. I'm a deeply passionate person so when I write or talk it comes from the heart therefore it allows me to do both without having to actually think about what I'm going to say rather it just pours out. That is also why you don't see me write in paragraphs. Now when I would write my reports professionally I wrote in paragraph form of course. If I were to write a mini type article post it may or may not have paragraphs. A lot of the time my long posts I write like the really long ones only take me as long as it would to actually type the words out on the screen bc there is zero thought involved and therefore I don't ever pause to think of what I'm going to say so this goes back to the thing I say where I write like I talk when I talk like I right and I jump from topic to topic by tangent all the time which is another reason for the lack of paragraphs. I simply don't think so when I start it just comes out flowing and I'll jump through several different topics before it's all over and I won't even realize I've done it. I did however when writing my professional reports which would be quite long at times bc I had to explain in such detail, I would make new paragraphs when transitioning into another type of topic. Here I don't consider this to be a professional type setting so I'm not as aware of starting new paragraphs as I would be otherwise. I know it can become quite confusing when you guys read my long posts or mini articles lol. Perhaps I'll start using paragraphs here to post moving forward since I'm aware of it now. So here's an example. New paragraph bc I'm about to jump ship. \nI ordered my iPhone 8 yesterday but I also ordered a couple other things as well. I'm totally going to customize my iPhone 8. I found a company called colorware that offers high end skins which I ordered the high gloss finish Red skin that covers the back and frame. Then I ordered a Zagg luxe model screen protector that comes in titanium silver so my entire front that is space grey will now be silver in color with the home button being the only black to be seen. \nSo to summarize, I'll have a Red and Silver iPhone that will totally be custom and unlike any other iPhone out there. I'll be sure to post pictures of my finished product once I install everything hopefully by Monday or Tuesday. \nI've never used this skin company before but I saw a YouTube review on them and it was great. They offer matte finishes and high gloss finishes. I ordered the high gloss bc it will be brighter and pop more.

If I had to make an educated guess I would venture to guess that the original iPhone 4.7 inch still does better in sales for the moment. This would a fun fact to know for sure. It always seems like plus models do better but it not the same with apple typically. That's why they have stuck with that original 4.7 inch design for four years straight because sales of this size phone have been off the charts. If the plus is doing anything compared to the 4.7 inch iPhone it's simply finally starting to catch up to the original size iPhone. It's way way more popular than you realize. I am quite sure if we could find factual numbers you'd see what I'm talking about. I'm pretty sure the original iPhone still out sells the plus model as the plus is still considered a niche type device but I will say that it's finally starting to become more of an even playing field though. I just think it has not yet quite caught up to the the sells of the original iPhone which I'd the 4.7 that design is iconic and probably the most popular smart phone design in the entire US market. That being the original 4.7 iPhone which was originally released on the iPhone 6. I remember it all to well as I was very used to the 5 and 5s size and I remember thinking that the 4.7 was a bit too large for me at the time due to being used to the small 5 and 5s but I soon fell in love with the 4.7 design and it's been my favorite iPhone ever since. I don't think I'm in the minority here. This applies to the majority of iPhone users still so the 5.5 inch plus is still considered to be a niche type market for apple compared to Android. It's a totally different world with apple. I think the 5.5 is finally starting to catch up to the original but I don't believe that they sell more plusses than they do regular 4.7 inch original iPhones yet. Some find a factual article related to this and post it. I'd be curious to know for sure as I'm just basing my thoughts off how well I know apple and how iconic the original iPhone design is to majority of the iPhone buyers out there.", "time": "11-20-2017 11:50 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6078370", "text": "Actually I did search before I posted what I said previously.

I totally thought the regular iconic design of the original iPhone still out sold the plus. When I was setting my moms new iPhone 8 up and putting her screen protector on I just kept thinking to myself wow this phone is so huge lol. I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t abandon the 4.7 inch iPhone then. There is definitely still a strong market out there for like myself but I was totally wrong for sure. Now I will say I like the plus if I\u2019m going to watch a movie or something but every day I much prefer the 4.7 inch iPhone in every way. So much easier to use. Easier to carry around. Out in your pocket. Just easier in general but I suppose larger screens are what sells the best. I personally like having one of each but still for a daily driver I would restart a 5 inch phone for sure. Everyone\u2019s tastes are different but according to the graphs more people prefer the bigger phones. I have tried to but I always go back to the smaller phones for every day use. I just find them to be much easier in every aspect. I guess more and more people are useijt their phones for lots of media purposes which I do prefer a larger phone in that regard. Day to day tasks though it\u2019s so much easier to carry around a 5 inch or around that size phone to me personally than to carry around a huge 5.5 or 5.7 inch screen phone. I think it\u2019s all in what you became used to because I\u2019ve certainly tried going to a larger screen several times with android as my daily phone but in the end I just found them too large to easily use and put in my pocket and to be obscure as well. The less the bulk the better to me. Now that I have this awesome skin on my new iPhone 8 I am beginning to think it was pointless for me to have ordered cases for it. I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019ll even use a case now as one it adds bulk and two I like the way my phone now looks and I don\u2019t want to cover it up now lol. I know that\u2019s dangerous but carrying a smaller phone is easier to keep a good grip on to ensure I won\u2019t drop it but I know anything could still happen. You never know when the laws of average finally catch up to you as I\u2019ve never dropped my phones hardly at all other than them falling off a table or something but just flat out dropping one I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever done it.

You build the person up to feel very comfortable with you to almost like they've known you for 10 years and the most important part is you ask them to help you.

We shall see as I'm calling first thing when they open tomorrow. I appreciate the great support. I do really want the 64g and to be totally honest my plan going in to this was to get the Pearl White since I've owned both the blue and black before. What got me is I had found the one I got for exactly what I told myself I could and would spend which was $199. Most all the phones I buy are 32g with expandable storage and I've never had any issues before so this is more of a mental thing and desiring the color I originally wanted. In the end I can live with the black if I have to but I've seriously just spent too much money on phones over the past year and since I've tried most everything out there I've spent way too much and lost a lot at it too. So I have to stick to my promise to myself this time even though it's only $50 more dollars that kind of thought right there is what keeps allowing me to spend more and more. I'll let you guys know tomorrow morning sometime if I'm able to pull this one off as I have a feeling it's going to be a tough one to overcome. I appreciate the support. By the way on a side note I've already downloaded pretty much all that I'll ever download and moving forward pictures and things will default to the SD card as I have it set that way and I still have right at 17g of free space left.

I'm very happy I chose this color now as at first before it arrived I was kind of on the fence but in person it's stunning. It goes well with all cases like right now I have a thin light blue case on it which the Pearl color tends to compliment any color case. I've got some Red cases that look awesome on it too which is why I plan to order a Red carbon fiber skin for the back of it. I think the contrast will look killer together.

I've just gotten where I don't like using cases but with the honor you're really forced to. But yeah if you saw the Pearl up close and in person you'd see what I was talking about. It looks really high class and the Pearl really shows off the lines and shape of the phone. Also another positive about the Pearl is you are totally unable to see fingerprints on the back of the phone. It's just vastly different than the blue and black. Which the blue used to be my favorite color but now I like the Pearl equally. I'm just glad I was able to grab a 64g model. Now when I download things I think nothing of it bc I have so much extra space but again I was looking at long term with this phone this time so I wanted that extra peace of mind knowing I'd be using it for a long while this time around. Now I've got my Axon 7 mini up for sale as I'm going to take what I get from it and save up to find a larger screen device that will be more of a media device for movies and things that I'll every once in a while rotate out with the honor but the honor will be my daily driver no matter what. I can't do large phones for a daily driver at all. Much too large for that so I'll be searching for something between 5.5 and 5.7. Of course if I can afford it I'll get the mate 9 but I'm not sure I want to spend that type of money on a second device for media. No way I could carry a 5.9 inch phone around every day trying to put that in my pocket or use it with ease like the honor 8 I can with.", "time": "11-03-2017 11:01 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6053063", "text": "YES, I love the silver metal frame around the phone!

I really truly wanted it and knowing this was about to be my long term phone since I'm finally taking a break from buying new gear to test out I wanted exactly what I had my heart set on. Only thing was that I was unsure about the Pearl White color but since I had owned the black and blue I thought let's just make a total change from the norm this time around so I went with the Pearl White and now I'm super glad I did it. It's a awesome color phone and I love the silver frame. I plan to order a dbrand carbon fiber Red skin for mine so at times I'll be able to use it without a case. Right now I have a thin low profile red case on it but you can still clearly see the phones color. This color matches everything too. I take it you have the Pearl color too. It's absolutely amazing in person. I am stoked about getting it and the 64g model. I initially wanted the blue until the last second I decided to totally change my norm up and get something drastically different than I normally do. I always buy either black phones or silver phones. Never White but what pulled me in was the silver frame and the actual Pearl color it has. I'm glad I decided to actually get exactly what I wanted to get that peace of mind.

Although I'm a fan of all metal phones you can't help but like the honor 8 and how it looks. It's very high end classy look to me. The light reflects off each color so nicely. I'm hoping when my skin comes in that I'll ditch my case and just pray I don't drop my phone. After all these years I've yet to drop and break a phone but with the honor 8 I know I'm just asking for trouble if I opt for no case. Right now or when I'm at my house I don't use one. When I installed that back protection film on mine that came with my screen protector it immediately gave it better grip so I've been using it without a case. When I leave the house I typically throw a case on it though. The phone just feels so much better and less bulky without a case no matter how thin it is. They just add bulk which I do not like very much. Plus right now I'm enjoying the entire new to me look of this Pearl White color phone which I've really never owned a white phone before but since this is a Pearl color I really don't consider it fully white. It's a cream color that looks amazing in person. Plus I just love the all silver frame as it gives it that extra pop of contrast. There is no doubt that the honor 8 is my all time favorite Android phone that I've ever used but then again I personally don't consider EMUI to be Android anyway. It's nothing remotely like Android at all to me. I personally don't you the newly added default app drawer. I keep mine like it originally came on 4.1 without the option of an app drawer and I've never even thought about using my Nova launcher on any of my honor 8s. I like EMUI just that much. It's butter smooth and fluid with zero lag what so ever. I'm always amazed that you can buy this flagship type phone for the cheaper price you can get it for and you sacrifice nothing. It's definitely a flagship made device all the way around. The only thing I'd change on it would be to have given it two front facing speakers for better media experience. The speaker is rather weak but that's the only flaw I can definitely live with that. I got spoiled by my Nexus 6p dual front facing stereo speakers and my Axon 7 fromt facing dual Dolby surround sound speakers which neither of those two phones did I have to use my Bluetooth jbl speaker when watching movies or being on YouTube for extended periods of time. Plus it's so easy to cover this bottom facing speaker up so in general I like dual front facing speakers and if the honor 8 had them it to me would have been the perfect smart phone.", "time": "11-04-2017 01:11 AM", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post6053092", "text": "I like translucent cases so it shows off the phone a bit", "time": "11-04-2017 12:16 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6053116", "text": "Absolutely!

This phone is so customizable and to be honest I didn't even realize just how much so the fisrt two times I owned it or either these play store apps I found weren't available previously. I've found one app that probably has over 75 themes. Then I found another app that has themes, icon packs and wallpapers then lastly another them with nothing but 100s of different font. I've downloaded a lot of stuff and the good thing is since I exchanged it for the 64g instead of the 32g now I don't have to be concerned about it taking my available space up like I would have been with the 32g. Now I'll probably download my playlist from my Amazon music app so I can play my songs offline anytime. I typically have never downloaded music being concerned with space but now I think I'm going to at least download my play list. I won't download any movies although I'll stream movies with this phone no problem as 5.2 inches is plenty big enough to watch a movie. Ultimately I'd like to one day soon get the Mate 9 for my media and movies device to rotate out with my honor but that'll be down the road. I have always though kept one smaller device and one larger device and right now I have two smaller devices. I'll have to wait until black Friday or a Christmas sale before I buy a larger screen device since I've over spent on phones this year trying new ones out. It's nice to have finally settled down to one specific device now to be my daily driver.

It'll be bad if that don't bc they do make a great phone with lots of cool features. I've liked EMUI since day one as I remember when I got my first honor 8 sitting in best buys parking lot for over an hour going all through the settings being amazed at how much I liked the software. I've heard lots of people say they don't care for it and they put a new launcher on their honor 8. I've never once even considered it as I think it's great. I love anything unique and different and that does not follow the typical. EMUI is definitely different but in a good way to me. I enjoy using the software. Like now they give you an option to have an app drawer but I use mine without it. I remember 4.1 which was my favorite number grade of EMUI actually. If it was an easy process to downgrade back to 4.1 I would do it in a second but I'm not even sure you can do that going that far back now. I liked it the best I guess bc it's what I used to first learn EMUI on so I'm partial to it. I liked the colored notifications type small icons at the top. Little things like that. It was a great version of EMUI and it was the most different from Android in general.

Yes Apple definitely restricts you in certain areas and is not customizable but then again it's really all I've ever known as I used it exclusively for many years once I finally broke my blackberry addiction. Since then it's only been Apple so that's my software of choice overall. I know it's not for everyone which is why we have a variety of Android products. The only one I found that I liked the best was the honor 8 and EMUI but only because it's so smooth no lag and fluid unlike a lot of other Android phones out there. The other Android phone I'd consider using in addition to the honor 8 is the Nexus 6p or the pixel which both phones are identical anyway as they have no skin on top of Android which I find to run very smooth and fluid when there is not a heavy skin involved. Overall I'm just used to IOS so it's my overall first choice for phones and tablets. I'm not saying Android is bad in any way rather it's just what I prefer. Android is great too and I'm not opposed to using Android at all but given the choice I'd choose IOS which yes is very straight forward without custom abilities but I guess it's all in what you are used to using which I happen to use Apple only for a long time and I'm most comfortable with it. They definitely do make smaller screens which I like Android better in that regard. The iPhone 8 that I'll be getting if I do get it will have the same 4.7 inch display which was what I used with the iPhone 6 and 6s. I'm curious now though if I'll find it to be too small for me now that I've used Android for over a year. That part I'm unsure of and I've never been a fan of the iPhone plus models at all. Not once have I ever owned a iPhone plus and I won't either. Just don't like them. The iPhone 10 with the larger screen is what I really want but they are back ordered until December which is a long time to wait on a phone.

Only if you are just going to cry bc it's not stock Android simply buy a stock Android phone. Even the professional reviews on placed a negative to EMUI which I totally think is bad professionally. Why not just call it different than that of Android instead of saying it's an inferior software that will annoy you. That's exactly why honor has made EMUI more stock Android like with each major update due to heavy complaints. I say to those who complained to go find another phone rather than downgrade this software. There are plenty of other ones to choose from. Just bc something is different does not mean it's bad. Not everything has to look like stock Android bc stock Android isn't the best software out there. There are choices.

I'm still considering the iPhone but honestly I want the iPhone 10 for it's larger screen size but they are back ordered forever. So my only three choices are the iPhone 8, iPhone 7 in the limited edition Red which only comes in 128g which is a plus or the Note 8. Xfinity does not have much to choose from. The iPhone 7 in Red appeals to me the most but it's now a dated phone which for Apple that really doesn't matter as updates will still be there for years. It's a little slower than the iPhone 8 and it's metal which I prefer. I'd probably actually go for it if I get the iPhone as there is really not a whole lot of difference between the 7 and 8. Plus the major factor is that I love Red so that would be the ultimate iPhone for me. So if I do get the iPhone the honor would definitely be returned and the $500 gift card and the $200 return from the honor would pay my phone off. Plus I think the Red iPhone 7 will retain resell value much better than the other models. Tough decision overall.

Being that I was exclusively Apple for so long I just became curious of what Android was like and how it compared to IOS. I found that I liked being able to to customize features and it definitely got me used to larger displays. That's a concern of mine if I go back to the iPhone being that the screen is 4.7 but to be honest my perfect sweet spot is exactly 5 inches so the iPhone is not far from that so I'm sure I will be fine going back to it being that it it's all I ever knew for so long. In fact the iPhone 6s was my all time favorite iPhone so the iPhone 8 is basically the same design but of course much more powerful with added features that the 6s didn't have. The fingerprint sensor is immediate. 3D touch. IOS 11 is much different than 9.3 that I was on. It's evolved since then to have many more options and features. The only thing I really dislike about the iPhone is that I can't change the color of my keyboard unless I use Gboard but it can be kind of buggy at times on the iPhone as it doesn't always show the Gboard as my keyboard when I'm in certain different applications as it automatically reverts back to the IOS keyboard even when Gboard is enabled. It does allow me to change my keyboard to greyish black but I just stay with the IOS keyboard to keep the bugs out. Maybe one day they will allow for a little more customization. Not likely but I'd like to see it happen as time goes on. But to go back to the OPs post as a IOS guy I did go through quite a few Android phones and it's been fun but I'm ready now to go back to IOS which is what I know best. I just hope once I hook up and activated my internet Wednesday that my two lines will become available to me so that I can finally place my order. Im on the fence right now between the iPhone 7 in the Red linited edition and the space grey iPhone 8. I'm torn between the two but leaning towards the iPhone 8. If I get I will no doubt miss EMUI as I've found it to be fun to use every day. I'm just Apple by heart and I always knew switching to Android would not be forever but now I least know I like it and am partial to a few different brands like Huawei honor, Moto Z phones, Nexus 6p and or I suppose pixel now although the Nexus 6p was identical to the original pixel but it was only tweaked then Google with their greed killed off the awesome Nexus line which was an affordable flagship of pure smooth android only to make the pixel which was another Nexus 6p put their name on it and then proceed to charge double what the 6p cost. I'm sure the pixel 2 is a little better now than the 6p in all aspects but I will say that pure Android meaning Android as Google intended Android to be used without a skin was butter smooth but with that you get less features similar to IOS in that regard. The Nexus 6p did not have many extra features bc there was no skin adding them. It was just the basics but one of the smoothest phone's I have ever used. It was slightly smoother than EMUI actually. I chose EMUI as my phone of choice on the Android side bc it ran without any lag and was smooth but still offered you lots of custom features and extras. I just am bummed that they have slowly changed it to reflect to be more and more like Android. I would venture to say that EMUI in China is still very 4.1 like compared to the US version. Over there I've read that the iPhone is very very popular so a lot of Chinese companies produce their software to be much like IOS but with you being able to customize it. Like the original 4.1 having no app drawer. I liked it that way and I also liked that there was not an option for an app drawer at all. It was their own version of software which was got terrible reviews here upon it's release. I just never saw anything wrong with it. I even liked the separation of the notification pull down at the top with the colored icons in the notification bar. I still to this day use stock EMUI without a launcher which I used Nova on all my other Android phones and I still use EMUI stock without an app drawer too. I know I'm in the big minority here but that is what made EMUI different than typical Android which to me was welcomed. So many people just plained hated on EMUI and what I didn't get was how or why they were so dang closed minded instead of just embracing the change and thinking outside the box but no they complained so much that honor caved in and has changed EMUI with every major update to become closer and closer to stock Android. Too bad there is nothing now that will stop that. Of course they are going to want to please the majority of their customers who I think are very closed minded and have trouble thinking outside the box. Android or stock Android does not have to always be the same. What's wrong with variety as that was another reason I made the change over to Android to see the variety and why I went through so many different phones testing out different gear and I enjoyed it. Every skin was a little different and it was cool to learn new skins and how they worked and what they had to offer. So now I'll either stay with honor or go back to Apple. I've now tried more than enough phones. I will say that one of my favorite brands was Moto. I absolutely loved the Moto mods. I actually still want to get another Moto Z phone as I even still have a couple of Moto mods left. My favorite mod was the JBL speakers mod. It was awesome for movies, music and talking by speaker phone. It made the phone thick but I kept that mod on my Moto Z play 75 percent of the time and oh that battery on the Z play is still the best on the market. I could go three days on one charge and 5 days if I had the Moto mod battery pack on it. Had I had enough to spend this time around I was actually going to get the Z play again over the honor 8 but the Z play at the time was $399 then I saw for about a week it hit a huge sale at Best buy down to only $279. I was like just my luck after I had bought the honor 8 and already invested into it. It was too late and I didn't have the time to to send it back for a refund and catch that huge sale best buy had on the Z play. I'm not sure if any of you ever owned any of the Moto Z phones but I've owned all of them and what I liked the most was the style back shells so you could change the look and color of your phone up every day with a variety of different back shell mods. So I still very much like Moto and their skin was very light almost giving you pure vanilla Android. If any of you ever change from the honor I highly recommend the Moto Z phones. The Moto mods are a blast to use. The projector mod allows you to just put it on and it automatically recognizes it and you can watch up to a 50 inch TV screen against a blank wall and watch a movie. The mods aren't cheap. By far though that JBL mod was the best. It was an amazing speaker and you didn't have to use an external Bluetooth speaker anymore when you had it on your phone. What's cool is how easy it was to change them out. You just slap it on and you're good to go with it. Honor and Moto I've found to be my two favorite Android experiences.", "time": "11-14-2017 05:50 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6068942", "text": "Did not you have an iPhone 7 before?", "time": "11-14-2017 08:13 AM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"postID": "post6071626", "text": "To get the thread back on track, was this a special sale?", "time": "11-15-2017 04:23 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6071806", "text": "Well it was an open box item at bh.", "time": "11-15-2017 06:07 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post6071873", "text": "I might be blind cause I don't see any cookies in this thread", "time": "11-15-2017 06:46 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6071943", "text": "We were just saying, \"we have [green] cookies!\" in reference to people jumping platforms from iOS to Android. \ud83d\ude1c", "time": "11-15-2017 07:27 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6072771", "text": "Yeah and we all want oreo cookies!", "time": "11-16-2017 10:40 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6074999", "text": "So would I be considered to be a green cookie lol .

Although I won't use a case all the time that Spiderman case will see quite a bit of time which was why I ordered it today. Plus is slim and thin so hardly any bulk with it. The other case I ordered was a Red leather apple case. Right now those are my only two cases as I want to see if some of my 6s cases fit the 8. I've read some articles where they say some style 6s cases actually fit the 8 as the design style is the same. The major difference is the camera is a little bigger so it'll depend on how big the cutout is on the 6s case whether it fits the 8 or not because as long as the case Hasan open bottom then it'll fit depending on the camera.

They have excellent 5 star reviews. Of course I would rather get some that are nationally recognized but these appear to be quite nice and down to even how they look to how they magnetically attach to each end then you charge them. I'd say the drawback I've seen is the play time is 3 hours which for me that perfectly fine but I've seen others with 8 to 10 hours of play time between charges. I no where near listen to music that long but at the same time 3 hours is very close to that of a long movie and if you didn't have a full charge then essentially they would die out on you during the middle of the movie. Same for using them to take calls which having to charge every 3 hours is a bad thing during the day. I do like that only one of the earbuds works for calls. It's the point that only after three hours you have to recharge them or it could be that they mean 3 hours to recharge after non stop continued usage of the earbuds is what lasts three hours so in fact these may indeed get you through an entire day as I will not be on a three hour call nor will I talk phone call after phone call for three hours straight and I assume during non use there will be no drain of the battery life on these. Plus these are water proof. You can even take a shower and listen to music in the mornings to help you wake up. That's a plus with these. I also like the look of the product and how you store them. Of course I love that they are totally Red. My favorite part about them so for you experts out there I need some help here. For the ones of you who know about Bluetooth tech well do you mind going to Amazon and pulling this exact product up and reading about it and then let me know if these are indeed a good quality Bluetooth pair of earbuds that you yourself would buy so I'll know whether or not to order them. I won't have a headphone jack so I'm going to definitely need some Bluetooth earbuds and I like this kind with absolutely no wires. I don't like the kind that are connected to each other by a wire going from one piece to the other as I will say most of the time I will only be using one of the two unless I'm watching a movie only. The rest of the time down to even just YouTube videos I'll only be using one of the earbuds. So if you guys don't mind will you let me know if I should purchase these or if you think I should keep searching for others? Since my iPhone 8 is Bluetooth 5.0 should I look for earbuds that are 5.0 as these are 4.2. Will that even make a difference when pairing them or keeping my connection. The feedback on these on Amazon are 5 stars with excellent feedback most saying they absolutely love the earbuds and sound quality is good. I just know that I occasionally use my wired earbuds with my headphone jack so I know I'll have a definite need for a pretty good pair of Bluetooth earbuds that are wireless like these. Would you recommend these? If not will you post a link to some that you would recommend so I can click on it and check them out. I like the price on these of course but I can spend a little more if I absolutely have to. I just need some tech advice here whether I should go ahead and order these or get something different or better if these you think are sub standard.

I've been on the phone with FedEx twice trying to persuade them to deliver my package as soon as possible as I seemed it time sensitive lol. I wasn't lying as it's very time sensitive to me lol. I had hoped FedEx would have shown by noon but it's already 130. I'm afraid they aren't going to show until late this evening which is torture lol. I am so ready to hear the sound of the loud FedEx truck drive up to my house. I simply cannot wait until it's delivered as I have my new silver Zagg screen protector already here but my skins have not yet been delivered. I'll post a before and after of my iPhone without the Zagg luxe screen protector and then a pic with it installed. It's really cool as it totally changes the entire look of the iPhone up. Everything on the front that is space grey will turn into a titanium silver color then it's really going to look unique once I install my full one piece Red skin that covers the entire frame to transforming the entire phone to a totally different color than that of a typical iPhone. Mine will truly be one of a kind as you won't see anything like it. Not many people know about the luxe screen protector from Zagg nor do they ever think to purchase the titanium silver color one as they all typically purchase the same color as their phone is. Mine will in fact change my entire color of the front then my skin will encumber the entire back and entire frame so the only space grey that you will see on my new iPhone is the home button which if I wanted to I could order a Red home button from Amazon that would really totally give it a drastic change overall. I am just not familiar with how the red home button would work with touch ID. It states that it works as it would normally but I'm afraid it may not stick well since that button will be used so much so I may not change the color of my home button but overall my phone will go from totally being all one color of space grey to having totally Red body and totally silver front. I never did use a skin on my 6s I had but I always used the silver Zagg luxe screen protector and people would ask me all the time what type of phone do I have. It makes just that huge of q difference once it's installed which I'll show you guys before and after pics of it today. I decided to order a special material skin made in high gloss for my body and frame so this skin will be extra different looking having a high gloss sheen to it. I'm super stocked about what my new iPhone is going to end up looking like. That's why I simply can't use a case to cover it up. No one out there will have an iPhone that looks like mine therefore making it highly unique and totally different. The only way one will know it's an iPhone is simply by the design of the iconic iPhone and notorious home button which will still be in space grey unless I decide to order that Red home button which isn't expensive. What was the most expensive was that special luxe edition screen protector from Zagg. That set me back $48 bucks but it does totally transform the iPhone to an entirely different color on the front. I'll throw a case on it until my special skin arrives. This skin is made to look by the high gloss sheen to look like the back has been painted as you won't be able to tell it's a skin. I watched a detailed review of this particular high gloss skin and it looks amazing. It'll be my first time using this company for a skin as I just discovered them last week. They are by profession a high grade graphic design and paint company so their skins they offer are limited to basically only iPhone and Samsung. The go back as far as the 6s so I did order a candy orsnge for the iPhone 6s plus that I'll be getting. I just replaced the screen protector on it as it needed a new one but I won't get the plus model until tomorrow which is when my mom's iPhone 8 plus will be delivered. I have to help her set her iPhones up as she does not really know how to work her iPhones well. I'll make one last back up on her 6s plus then wipe it and factory reset it for myself to put my info into to it then I'll transfer her last back up on to her new iPhone and then then will have the same exact set up as she did on her 6s plus on her iPhone 8. When you transfer apple data it transfers everything exactly in the order it was on the last phone. She will be able to then open her iPhone 8 up and it essentially will look identical to her 6s even down to how all her apps were placed before. It's pretty cool. On mine I'll choose my last back up I had when I briefly owned the iPhone SE which makes it much easier as I won't have to download any apps at all. Everything will look identical to how my SE looked when I last had it 6 months ago. Funny that I still remember all my apple iCloud info like email and password as icloud saves everything totally in every aspect down to even how you had all your settings on you phone set to and what type of order your apps were set up like. I love apple in that regard. Anyways FedEx is killing me. I'm glued to the window waiting. Plus I have my axon 7 sold too so as soon as FedEx arrives the guy is coming to purchase my axon 7 which is a bonus as I'll end up using that money to order my Bluetooth earbuds and a charging pad with. So shortly I'll have some before and after pictures I'll post to show you guys the luxe model Zagg screen protector. I've had more compliments on my iphones using that silver color front screen protector for some reason. When before I started using it I never had anyone comment on my phone before. It really makes that big of a change and difference. Now I'm about to read up on the Red touch ID home button. I think that it will look pretty cool against the silver front then it would match my back body skin. They are only about $6 bucks but I don't see how it would still recognize your fingerprint though so I'll have to research that first.", "time": "11-20-2017 02:12 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6078377", "text": "Man that was hard to read.

I still watch movies some but only on a tablet which is why I want to get another iPad or high end laptop now. Probably an iPad though so I can pair it with my phone.

TV just doesn\u2019t interest me anymore. The only time I\u2019ll watch TV is if I decide to catch a NFL game or try and watch the patriots play because I am a fan of Tom Brady. He\u2019s definitely one of the best competitors that ever played. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s the best all time QB like many say but he\u2019s mentally superior to almost all other quarterbacks which that makes up where he lacks in how slow he is but none the less I like watching him take completely over a game by himself. Luckily my new phone ariivex around 130 today so I didn\u2019t have to wait too long then I spent the rest of the afternoon setting mine up and customizing it then setting my moms up for her and showing her some stuff about IOS which she is still learning how to use the iPhone.

I actually and I mean this write without thought meaning I don't think about what I'm going write as it just comes out of me which is why when I don't use paragraphs it's quite hard to take in. You'll notice I have several different topics within that one blog but it only took less than 5 minutes even if that to create. I type fast and again I write without any type of planning in regard as to what I'm going to say. It's hard to explain. It's like when you do something that you're good at and you really don't even have to place any thought to perform it well I write and I talk like that. I'm never lost for words. When I taught junior college it was so easy to walk in just knowing the rough topic and I would lecture without any thought but I also kept everyone involved as my classes were highly discussion oriented so no matter what everyone in my classes learned the material I taught them because I kept them engaged at all times. I'm a firm believer that most everyone stops the ability to retain and learn about after an hour and half straight then once you reach that magic number most everyone in this world stops retaining so it was pointless to me to ever keep them the three hours I was supposed to keep them. No more than an hour and a half and most times my classes would last one hour. I was able to cover every bit of the material needed in that time frame so all the students who took my class with the intention of just filling an elective to graduate well they ended up learning whether they had planned not to or whether they had any interest as I always made probing remarks which sparked full discussion which brought everyone in to contribute. It made them want to participate whether they knew it or not. I know exactly how to get anything our of a person whether they had no intention of telling me or not. Just something I've always been able to do by words and how I use them. \nParagraph... Lol. My phone arrived!!! My high glass painted looking skin arrived too!! My next post will contain some quick pictures I took of my final masterpiece of customization to my new iPhone 8 which now looks nothing like an iPhone. It's totally 100 percent customized and I have one minor detail left I plan to do which is change the color of the Apple logo on the back except I'm having a tough time deciding on what color to make my apple logo. Maybe blue. Maybe silver. Maybe chrome silver. Maybe sky blue. I just don't know yet. I may end up ordering a red touch ID button for the front which would really contrast nicely with the silver titanium looking front that my phone now has with my new luxe screen protector from Zagg which is so grossly over priced but I'm a visionary so I already knew what I wanted my phone to look like before I brought it to life. That's how I approach everything in life. I see a mental picture of it before then I take the steps to bring it to life. I even vision my goals in life by way of a mental photograph of myself in a certain situation standing there already have achieving the goals I set for myself and I go after them by the vision of that picture I saw originally before I started to work towards that goal. So anything I do I vision it first then take the steps to bring that mental picture to life. It's great as I love being a visionary. It makes doing things in life interesting because I can already see the final result before I even start no matter what it is that I vision. Hard to explain. \nParagraph... Lol. I'm so super stoked about the new iPhone 8. I totally feel like I never missed a beat. I feel right back at home with IOS. It's all I ever knew for many years and I love the one handed usage I get from the 4.7 inch screen size of the regular iPhone. I've really missed this phone and now being back with apple I won't have any desire to buy and sell phones until it's time to upgrade after 12 months of use. If I were to make any change before the 12 months were up is if I had the opportunity to get the iPhone 10 which is what I originally wanted but it's back ordered for a while out and I was dead set on making the changes to find a device that I would use long term as I was going through different phones all the time as it was fun to test out new gear and I will say Android offers a ton of variety where apple does not. So by going back to apple I've eliminated the desire to constantly change devices as Apple offers their simple one to two device choices and that's it. So by customizing my new iPhone it's like having a brand new style and make iPhone that no one else has and I'm quite sure when you see my iPhone it will be the only one you'll ever see that looks like mine. One of a kind iPhone. I love it. This skin is really nice. Better than Dbrand I think. The material is much less thinner which makes for a better fit plus Dbrand did not offer anything to completely cover the entire frame thus making it appear it came this way stock from the Apple factory like it does now.", "time": "11-20-2017 06:56 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6078812", "text": "Sweet...

I promise you guys that post took me no longer than 5 minutes to write no lie. I didn\u2019t have to think therefore it took no time at all. \nThe pics I posted don\u2019t even close to do my phone justice to what it looks like in person. It\u2019s so awesome I can\u2019t take my eyes off the Red. It\u2019s the perfect color Red with just that hint of orange hue to it. A true bright cherry Red but this skin I ordered cane in a high glossy finish unlike any skin I\u2019ve seen or used before. Had this company offered a skin for the Honor 8 when I had one I would have definitely used them. This skin company by far is better than Dbrand and Dbrand is supposedly the best out there. This company though mains profession is not mobile phone skins but their profession is more graphics and I believe something to with high end paint. So they just dabble with the skins which is why they only offer a small variety of skins mainly iPhone and Samsung I guess the two most popular out there but soon though I truly believe Huawei Honor will take Samsung\u2019s place for number one once they get a strong hold in the US. I\u2019ll definitely be back to Huawei Honor at some point. I definitely have not forgotten about them nor will I ever. They are a far superior company already compared to Samsung its just that most all people out there don\u2019t this yet but within about three years they will and in 5 years max they will be the go to android company out there like Samsung is now. I could be wrong but I strongly believe they will rival Samsung for number one. I think they need to offer 2k resolution screens to rival Samsung by samsung has definitely got the best looking resolution screens in the world. They are unbelievable. That S8 I had was so good that it made everything else I looked like look blurry. So Huawei Honor is going to have step up and offer more than the average 1080p. Example the Mate 9 should have come with a 2k resolution screen but nope they used 1080p. For them to be able to take over Samsung they will no doubt have to change their approach to going above 1080p. While it\u2019s fine and all they are just going to have to do better once they enter the US. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how they end up progressing once here and how fast. It\u2019ll depend heavily whether they stay true to their superior pricing and superior and innovative products. I guess soon we all will see what will happen once they are here full blown. Hopefully they will hurry it up. They have a lot of customers here now who definitely want more selection of their great devices. To me it was always frustrating to keep seeing them release awesome new phones but yet we could not have a chance to get any of them.

That\u2019s actually an awesome skin I found as I just discovered the company last week called colorware as they make an all one piece skin the covers the back and frame at one time time where the other companies make two separate skins one for the back then another for the frame which leaves visible lines which make it noticeable it\u2019s a skin. This company does it in all one full skin thus leaving no visible separate lines between the back and frame of the phone. Plus they offer two choices. Either a high gloss finish that looks like paint and real factory look in person or they offer the matte finish. I highly recommend this skin company but they only offer limited skins to be only apple and a couple Samsung. It really does look like it came stock from the factory in that color in person. They are way better than dbrand. I wished they would have offered a skin for the honor 8 as I would have definitely gotten one from them over dbrand. This skin feels amazing and it\u2019s so glossy that it actually collects fingerprints on it. \nOn a side note I have a really important question for you guys that I need some major advice on. I decided to go to the apple store today and I bought the iPad Pro 10.5 inch which was what I wanted but the opportunity presented itself while I was there that I could have gotten the Mac book pro laptop instead. I went ahead and got the iPad Pro but I still can go back and exchange it. Please advise me what you guys would do if you had to make the decision between the Mac book laptop or iPad Pro 10.5 inch. I\u2019m literally torn into pieces on which one I should get and I need some major advice to help me make the right decision. If you guys don\u2019t mind please let me know what you would do and which one you would choose between the two and why. I simply am totally torn as to which one I should now get. I\u2019m keeping which ever one long term so would you get the iPad Pro that is cellular where you can take it everywhere you go and have internet access or would you opt for the Mac book laptop where it\u2019s a home only device and not cellular. Plus I dislike track pads and I always use an external mouse with my laptops. I\u2019ve pondered this decision so much tonight that I\u2019m totally confused now and literally do not know what to do. I am in need of some good sound advice and insight to help me make the best decision as it was really expensive and I don\u2019t want to be a month later and say I should have gotten A device or I should have gotten B device. Help please!! I\u2019m so torn between which one I should get that I\u2019ve given myself a headache lol. I\u2019m going to sleep on it and wait on you guys to tell me what the best decision is. I greatly appreciate all of your help. It\u2019s an expensive decision and one I\u2019ll be stuck with for a long time.

If Xfinity mobile offered a larger screen device that was 16.9 ratio I'd go for it over the 18.9 so I still stand behind my statement but since I really have no choice yes I would still in fact use it but it's not going to be my daily driver most likely and I'd use it mainly for media and the S pen for notes which I've personally never owned a note before so I'm rather curious to test it out as I'm always a fan of testing new gear out.

I'll watch movies but regular cable I have gotten to where I just don't watch TV anymore unless I catch an NFL game every once in a while so I had no need for their deluxe expensive plan just to qualify for the $500 gift card. Now if I were to get a Samsung phone I'd definitely get that $200 gift card but after owning both the S7s and the S8 I'm really not much of a fan of Samsung other than for their unbelievable screen resolution they have.

Looks like it will be on Tuesday before I can place an order as they require the internet to be hooked up and activated before they make two lines available to me. I will have to give it all some thought now that I have to wait which possibly might make me not even order a new phone once I give myself time to think it through bc I typically act off impulse rather than thinking a decision through. I've always been like that and I yes I've made some bad decisions and I've made some good decisions like that so I'm not changing now but since I'm forced to think it through for a few days instead of ordering right now I might just not even do it at all. I'll have to wait until it's hooked up and see how I feel towards it. It's seems to be becoming too difficult as too many obstacles which could be a sign to just let it go all together.

That shows lack of integrity of a company no matter what model it is. Same with the honor 8. There is a lot of speculation that the honor 8 won't receive a full two years worth of updates either but overall all their phones should be updated as they initially promised as part of their promotion to sell the product. What about all the honor 5x users. Why should they be left out to dry just because the honor 8 did better in sales. Integrity is more important for a company than just doing what makes them the most money long term. Especially if they desire to enter the US market and become number one as ive read in many articles. If you can't trust that your product you bought will not get the updates initially promised to you then why would one to continue to buy from a company that does not keep their business promises for that said product. All it does is puts lack of faith and trust in the potential repeat customer making them buy from a company who does hold integrity which is their promise to you on any product they sell and state what they will offer with that product you just bought. Like right now I have my doubts that the honor 8 will see a full two years of updates or if it does we will get one more at the very last second. Half done and not optimized like it should have been. Plus I don't see honor ever releasing the honor 9 here. That device is pushing 6 months old now. We will not see it and I'm even thinking we won't see another honor flagship either to take the place of the honor 8 and that is a huge let down to me. I love Huawei honor and I believe they do make superior devices with great prices but as they have stated in articles, the US is not high on their current priority list right now meaning we probably won't get another honor flagship to rival the honor 8 like we all certainly would want to see. I'd love to be able to have an opportunity to buy another honor device but it's not looking like I'll have that chance. They have some great phones to choose from too. We might see maybe one mid range model but nothing as good as the honor 8 or else they would have released the honor 9 or the honor 8 pro by now.

EMUI is what makes them stand out of the crowd not blend in. For these ones who dislikes EMUI why publicly hate on it even down to the professional reviewers. Simply put it you don't welcome a good nice solid change to what Android is which is laggy, choppy and sticky then don't even bother reviewing the honor 8 nor buying it. Honor I'm afraid is going to cave in to the majority here and we will continue to see EMUI become more and more like stock Android which if so they will loose me as a faithful customer. I loved 4.1 and I'm actually thinking about going back to it as I called Huawei USA the other day and they emailed me the official roll back software and instructions. 4.1 was how I learned to use EMUI so it by far is my favorite but we have seen a slow progression towards stock Android with every major update since 4.1 was the current software. I highly doubt Huawei honor would revert back to the more unique and different than Android software as that would be exactly what majority of EMUI users do not want which makes no sense to me. Why use the phone or buy the phone them completely complain about the software experience. Simply put buy a touchwiz Samsung and enjoy a laggy and choppy experience like that of most all of Android anyway. My point is that Huawei Honor needs to stick with EMUI being as different from Android as possible as I see their software as innovation and not a bad thing just bc there is a lack of an app drawer or settings it totally different than typical Android but I digress. We will continue to see EMUI evolve into more like stock Android as times goes on and no way now would they revert back to the likes of 4.1 which was my favorite version of EMUI simply bc it was just that unique and different than typical Android as we know it. Still though almost every review I see the reviwer places a negative comment towards EMUI though. What in the world is so bad about it being different and why not welcome the change and unique innovation that 4.1 brought to the user experience. How can that be a negative unless you are just an Android bandwagoner and hate on anything different than Android. I did not even consider 4.1 to even be Android at all. It was in it's own league. I saw that as a great thing and that is why I still use the honor 8 today but when they completely turn into stock Android then they will loose me as a faithful supporter and customer.

Just go in settings and type in optimize and go to that setting and it allows you to shut down all your apps running in the background all at one time which is basically does the same thing doze does. Except you manually have to do it on 7.0 or lower I believe. Double check me on that by a Google search about what upgrade did doze come with. There is no setting for doze as it just automatically kicks in after your phone goes to sleep and is sitting still after a few minutes so in theory it will work during the day too when times you aren't using your phone which will save your battery life. If you've not optimized your honor yet I highly recommend that you do. My battery life is ten times better now but leave open the apps that you still want to allow to refresh like your email or Facebook which I didn't but I did for Instagram on mine.

Now for some reason I truly think we will be seeing the honor 8 pro. One reason is due to the success of the honor 8 name in the US so I think they will stick with that name since it's widely known and such a good device and release the honor 8 pro version now. Most likely early December before Christmas sales. There's a chance we may see it by black Friday but I'm thinking early December. I originally thought and wanted it to be the honor 9 but now I don't think we will ever see that device here. Also the honor 8 pro has not been released very long as it was in 2017 so it's very current and new. It has a 5.7 inch display and runs the Kirin 960 chip. Just an all around upgrade to the honor 8. I personally would get one to be utilized as my media phone due to the 5.7 inch screen and continue the regular honor 8 to be my daily driver. It just makes sense for honor to keep building on the honor 8 name by releasing the pro model here. I could be wrong but I have a strong gut feeling that is what we will see next from honor here. They are certainly due to release something and my second choice to be released here would be the 7x which is actually a downgrade from the honor 8. I would rather see them top the honor 8 although that's going to be tough to do as the honor 8 to me is very much a flagship device in just about every aspect.", "time": "11-02-2017 10:47 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6051360", "text": "It would be great to see the h8p.

Honestly I think the honor 8 did very good here in the US for a unlocked non carrier phone. The phone is widely known for not being a carrier phone. I'm with it long term now so the only way I'd change or get something else is if honor releases another flagship type honor device here. If it's the 7x they release I won't have any interest in it bc it won't top the honor 8. I hope they release something comparable to the honor 8 or better. The question is when and if they do it. Yeah I am on my third one but I'm glad to say the others were 32g and black and blue. This time around I'm Pearl White and 64g as I'm going long term this time. I've tried out well enough other phones now and I always default back to the honor 8 so I know that I enjoy the phone. I hope they release the honor 8 pro as I'd get that and use it as my media device and keep my honor 8 as my daily driver. I can't do a large phone as a daily user. 5.7 inches in the pro version is quite large for me but great for media. That is if they aren't too expensive. The honor 8 pro is simply just my guess as to be the next phone they release. Originally it was the honor 9 that I thought we'd see but now I don't think we will see that device at all. Plus the honor 8 pro is a fairly new release in 2017 so it's still very current and for honor it carries on the honor 8 name which my thoughts dis very well in the US considering what it was up against.

I never read any articles saying sales were poor but maybe my view on the honor 8 from being on this forum and on YouTube had me thinking it had done fairly well.

The honor 8 is and was such a good device and we all know Huawei honor has lots more great devices which we will never even see. That's too bad to hear. I really thought that we'd see the honor 8 pro due to the honor 8 name being known here and people would buy it feeding off the honor 8 name that's already widely established. Now that makes me think we will only see devices like the honor 6x or that mid level type phone which is what the 7x is like. It's nowhere near as good as the honor 8 but sense you said they said sales were bad then I can definitely see the mid level being released now opposed to the honor flagship devices here in the US. Personally I think they should still offer a mid level and a flagship in the honor devices here in the US. I guess to produce a flagship honor device here and it not do well they'd loose money and we know they aren't in business for that. Looks like we all are going to have to wait until they officially enter the US market with the major carriers to see more variety of both honor and Huawei. How about the mate 9. Do you know if it ended up doing well here in the US. Maybe we will see a Huawei release instead of an honor but of course that means way more expensive. Now I feel like we might not see anything else until 2018 and nothing now for the rest of this year. I hope I'm wrong about all of it. I really like Huawei honor. EMUI is awesome and they produce a great phone on both sides budget and high end expensive. I was sure hoping they'd release something that equaled to or was a step above the honor 8.

I've done a lot of research on Huawei honor as a company but I've never checked or looked at the honor 8 sales. I honestly had no idea of how poorly it sold. That being said it makes me rethink my entire outlook on what honor releases next here in the US. Now I see it being highly doubtful that they will release anything comparable if not better than the honor 8 now. It kills me to say that bc I totally expected to see something to replace the honor 8. Bums me out. Looks like they will focus on the lower mid range phones and no more honor flagships for a while. If I was going to get another honor phone I'd only get what ever replaced and was comparable to the honor 8. So I would not have any interest in the 7x since it'll be a couple steps below the honor 8 unless it has a large display that I could use for movies and media to rotate out with my homor 8. That being said it now really makes me want the mate 9 as my media and movies phone but it's still expensive and I spent enough on phones this past year already. That's why I'm taking a break for a long while and settling down with the 64g honor 8. Now I just need my second phone to have a 5.5 inch screen or larger so if the 7x has that then in that case I'd be interested in one if that's what they release here next. Right now I have two 5.2 inch display phones so I know my other phone won't see any usage anymore so I'll probably sale it and save up for a budget type phone with a larger display in the next couple of months or so. That or I might try and locate a used mate 9 also to save money. The mate 9 would be a great media phone but no way I could use it as my daily driver. It's just too big to use on a daily basis for me. The 5.2 inch screen is almost the perfect size for a daily phone.

If so that phone is a step below the honor 8 and a step above the honor 6x. I'm not sure I'd be interested in something less than the specs of the flagship type phone from honor such as the honor 8. Heck the honor 8 can easily compete with some of the high end flagships on the market with it that are double in price. Then what are your thoughts of when we will see another honor model released here in the US. The more and more I take this all in the more I beginning to think it will be the 7x now instead of the honor 8 pro. That really bites bc I was really looking forward to something that rivaled the honor 8 as it truly is a very good device. I know some wished it was larger but me personally I'm fine with the 5.2 inch screen as a daily driver as opposed to 5.5 or larger which I have tried but in the end I just can't do a large phone on a daily basis. This is another reason I had hoped for the honor 8 pro so I could rotate it out with my honor 8 from time to time using it for a lot of media. Really in the end I just wish Huawei honor would release more of a variety of phones here in the US to give us all choices but we actually don't even have a choice at all as they barely release any of their phones here so if we want an honor it's only one or two phones to choose from. If we want a Huawei then it's only the mate 9 which by the way I still would not mind getting that device even though the mate 10 is out now. I've heard lots of good things about the mate 9 still today. So do you think we will be seeing the 7x which if I remember correctly the chip in it is still in the 600s or am I wrong about that. It sounds as if I'm right that they will only be replacing the 6x and nothing to replace the upper end honor 8. What a let down for my favorite smart phone company that now will become even more limited and we will get nothing to replace or top the honor 8. It's like a tease as we all see all their phones being reviewed but yet we can't use them here in the US. Like I wanted the P10 but of course it was never even an option.

Whether or not if they release another honor flagship would be my question to them. I know it's been stated that the honor 8 sales were poor but I think personally they expected this as the phone is only an unlocked device with no carrier ties then add that Huawei Honor was already unknown here. To me this makes total sense that they would have never expected the honor or Huawei phones in the US to break any records in sales or in other words they knew it was only a starting point. I feel for what they were up against that the honor 8 did just as they expected it would if not better due to the circumstances that we're in place upon it's initial release. This is why I believe we will still see both brands continued to be released in the US as from here they will only grow stronger in the US market just now only having just established themselves here which has only been for a year now. With all that said I think they have not done all that bad. Look at the mate 9 which was released after the honor 8. It did pretty well here and it was twice as expensive as the honor 8 which was the phone that actually put them on the map in the US bringing their brand recognition into existence. I believe they know exactly what they are doing business wise and they already know what phones will be next to be released but simply not disclosing it for business anticipation purposes. Keeping people interested in what's coming next is a marketing scheme in business. Again they did not become number two world wide for poor business decisions. That's why I believe we will in fact get more updates to the honor 8 as it's their current honor flagship here in the US and also the phone that sparked their initial presence in the US. I don't see them just totally not giving the honor 8 what they promised as a good business practice from a strong more than well established mobile phone company that's number two world wide. My question to them would be will they continue with both brands here in a flagship manner or will they focus their efforts on one more than the other moving forward. I do think they will follow through with their previous stated commitments to all the phones they've released here thus far. I think personally they will continue to release a mixture of both honor and Huawei to Target two different customer bases. Just like their branding already is which Huawei being their high end flagship and honor bring their upper end mid range.

But on a white screen you could easily tell and I picked up on it during the set up and I immediately called him and he was stuttering then he claimed it happened during shipping but I was mad at him at that point so he ended up sending me $25 dollars to ship it back plus he gave me the $10 dollar swappa fee and then he refunded me as soon as it was trackable in UPS site. You don't do all those things for someone if you truly didn't know it was already defective. It just left a bad taste in my mouth like wow who can you actually trust these days. I left him negative feedback as there is no doubt that he knew plus he cost me about $75 dollars in accessories that I've still not had the chance to send back yet plus it's going to be a huge hassle bc I've got separate ups labels for everything. Anyways I won't let that get in the way from me buying again from swappa as I know I'll have to take the leap of faith again. I hope to locate a deal on a Mate 9 on there when I get ready to buy one. That 5.9 inch screen will be awesome for movies and media type stuff and I'll rotate the two phones out quite a bit too. The honor 8 will no doubt be my main go to phone but there will be days or weeks where I'll use the Mate 9 full time too. It's just a big phone and hard to put in your pocket. I wonder how the 1080p looks on the mate 9 as that is a very large screen to only be using 1080p. Does anyone know if it's amoled or not? I've not heard either way or not. I would hope so. 1080p is fine on the honor 8 bc it's only 5.2 inches but you're talking right at a 6 inch screen just to only have 1080p. Anyone know if this has been an issue on viewing experience? I know it's great for battery life. By the way I've done a lot of stuff in settings to help preserve my battery life on my honor 8 which has gotten better from when I first got it. I optimized it to shut down most all the apps from running in the background after I stop using them. That helped a lot. I left my email open to refresh and Instagram open to refresh. I definitely shut down YouTube as it was a battery hog and killer in the background until I optimized it.

They of course focus their efforts everywhere else but the US. I believe they have recently entered other parts of the world and are of course growing there too. Pretty much the US market is the only part of the world and they hold no market share in and just think how powerful the US is in terms of sales and recognition for any company for that matter but yet Huawei Honor somehow has managed to still become number two in the world without any US market share. So think about it. Once they enter the US and establish themselves here which won't take but a year or two, think just how powerful and big they will in fact become. There is no possible way that they won't take the number one position in the world within the mobile industry once getting a strong hold here in the US. The US is one of the most powerful or if the most elite places in the world and that goes for everything to include global sales recognition. Once Huawei honor establishes themselves here they will very quickly within two years of entering the US then having ties with the four major carriers here become number one world wide. I don't think they will ever surpass Apple for being number one in the US alone but world wide they no doubt will be on top. They are full of innovation which leads to creativity that leads to superior and unique products that grow sales. We in the US only have access to only three of their many many devices which are the honor 8, mate 9 and honor 6x. A lot have stated here that the honor 8 did poorly in terms of sales here but I think honor already knew that would in fact be the case and the honor 8 actually did better here than what honor had initially projected for the honor 8. It's why I think the honor 8 will indeed get updated with Oreo but very late though bc the US as they have stated in articles I've read isn't their priority right now. Huawei honors plan is to enter the US when 5g rolls out and all the major carriers are offering it which 5g not only will be much faster but from what I read it will open up avenues for the mobile tech industry that we've never seen before. That's when Huawei plans to officially enter the US which I believe that to be about two years away now. So one day we will get the opportunity to choose from all of their already superior to Samsung products and I look forward to that. Personally I'll always be more of a fan of the honor line bc they offer flagship level and spec devices at an affordable price just like the honor 8 is. I've heard and read on multiple occasions that the Kirin 950 is comparable to the 820 flagship processor. What flagship phone that uses the 820 can you get for 300 dollars here in the US that you can think of for the same price? I can't think of any. So if they stay true to their superior mid range devices at such an affordable price there is no way they will not dominate the US in the near future. It's a big reason why I'm such a fan of the honor 8. It's an amazing flagship level device that can be had for around $300 or at times even cheaper.

It's sad because I think a lot of users will merely go for \"what's in\" as opposed to trying something different.

What I'm afraid of is that once they partner up with the major carriers a lot of their phones are going to be carrier exclusive thus leaving us unlocked phone consumers oyt to dry. We won't have full access to all of their phones due to the exclusive relationships with some of the carriers. Verizon is notorious for having exclusive Verizon only phones as well as AT&T too.

When I get on I'll stay on for a little while then put it down to come back later and do it over again. But like overnight I get hardly any drainage now. At first it was draining overnight rapidly. It's odd they don't ship you the phone to be as optimized as it can be out of the box. You'd think that would be standard but no you have to go into settings and dig for the function or on some phones it only allows you to do it one app at a time. The honor allows you to shut them all down at once where my 6p I had to go to one app at a time to shut it off from running in the background which is a major pain but the reward is huge as battery life is twice a good after optimizing your apps to not run in the background. To be honest I don't see the need to have to continue to keep running in the background anyway. I would think phones would be made to have the highest standard for optimization as possible. Speaking of that I think that is why IOS rune so well and is so efficient. Apps shut down after a certain time upon closing them where Android keeps theirs running unless you find the setting to shut them off. The iPhone 8 only has a 1900 amp battery but the battery life is great lasting over a full day on one charge. Then it is faster than Android but only runs off of 2 gigs of RAM vs Android having double and triple that in ram so I don't understand why people say that Android is just as efficient as IOS is. It's not true at all. Think if our honor 8 ran off of only 2gigs of ram. Our performance would be horrible compared to how good it is now. I'm not exactly sure how Apple does it but they definitely have a more efficient optimized software. I'm not sure if that's why it runs so butter smooth or not either. I have never experienced lag with IOS or EMUI but I definitely have with Samsung's flagships. Even Moto phones I've experienced lag. I honestly don't know how huawei honor is able to place such a heavy skin on top of Android which is so heavy that it totally transforms the software to not be like Android at all but yet they've some how done it and the honor runs as smooth as IOS with absolutely zero lag. I've never experienced any lag with any of my honor phones. No choppy or sticky experience. Apps open up immediately and the phone never stutters. Not even if you have multiple apps open in your task menu too. Does anyone know what honor does differently than say like Samsung's touchwiz which is notorious for lagging and stutter. Even the S8 lagged and stuttered and it ran off the 835 Snapdragon and had four gigs of RAM and their skin is nowhere near as heavy as EMUI. So what does Huawei honor do differently than Samsung that gives you a smooth no lag at all experience at half the cost of what a Samsung flagship runs you? Anyone have any ideas or knowledge on this? I'm very curious of why EMUI runs like IOS and not like a lot of the other laggy Android phones I've used before notable being samsungs finest still lagging and bogging down under just normal usage. Is it just that huawei honor makes a superior optimized device over Samsung or is it something else that creates touchwiz to lag so badly even on Samsung's best phones. When I say lag or choppy and sticky it's not like it's just awful but it's very noticeable compared to EMUI. That's another reason why I never quite understood why so many people did not like EMUI. I mean this phone runs as smooth as butter with absolutely zero stutter. I'm amazed by it compared to other Android phones so I would love to know what Huawei honor does so differently than the majority of other Android devices where you no doubt get that stutter or that occasional lag with it being more choppy and sticky than butter smooth like honors software. I would love to know how honor does it.

I think I'm going to order another one for back up just in case I need it as this protector is very thin and I'm sure it would crack more easily than the typical thickness of other screen protectors. I just wished it came as a two pack bc it's already more expensive then pretty much all the other ones that even have a two pack.

I'd say it's typical on fingerprints but very easy to wipe down of course. Where you're going to be amazed is the full coverage fit on a phone that has slightly curved edges that just does not end up showing any type of halo. I've gone through lots of tempered glass protectors off Amazon and everyone of them left a halo other than this one. The only conclusion I can think of as to why it does not is because it's 0.2 in thickness. It just melts into the honor 8s screen. As far as the Pearl White is concerned I absolutely cannot tell I've got a screen protector on it. When I had the blue and black I could barely see it. The Pearl just totally hides it but you in fact will not see a halo but yet you get full coverage. When you feel it you can tell immediately that it's much more thin than your typical screen protector is. If the halo bothers you in any way I very much highly recommend you get this one and give it a try. I'm confident that you will for sure be glad you got it. The only drawback is it's not a two pack for the $11.99 price tag. So you might want to order two of them one for back up. In fact I need to place a order for another one myself. I was just running low on funds from buying the 64g honor 8 so I only ordered one this month. Next month I'll order another one. You'll have to be a little more careful installing this one due to how thin it is but unless you bend it pretty excessively you should not crack it. I just like having at least one screen protector back up in case I crack one or something happens like I chip this one or something. But yeah you'll see a few fingerprints but nothing that you would not see on anything else. Overall I strongly believe it's the best screen protector you can get for the honor 8 hands down no way around it. They it out. You won't regret it.

It's not so thin that it offers less protection as it's still very sturdy. The reason why I know I'd because in the past when one time I dropped the screen protector before I stalling it so I had to take and load it up wish dishwashing soap and rinse it off in the sink. When I was doing that it allowed me to actually feel how sturdy it was as it would still bend to a certain degree without breaking and the thickness is not as thin as it would lead you to believe but it is thinner than than the what is it I think 0.33 thickness of a typical screen protector. So the protection for your real screen against a drop is still there if that was what you were worried about. It's plenty still very sturdy enough to protect your screen if you were to drop your phone. It's not paper thin or anything but it is a little thinner than the average protector but due to it being a little thinner I believe this is why it leaves no halo what so ever. I've never dropped my phone on a hard surface before to prove what I'm saying about how it should protect just fine but handling it like I did that time allowed me to feel just how sturdy it still was even though just a little thinner. I strongly believe it's the best screen protector you can get for the Honor 8 as it gives you full cooverage still with no halo. All the others I've tried and I've tried a lot of them certainly left a visible halo after applying the protector. I only tried this one bc it specifically said it was thinner so I thought to myself at that moment that I wonder if that will help with the huge halo left by all the other ones I tried and I was right. I got lucky and found it but I don't think you have anything to worry about in regard to it protecting your real screen if you were to drop it. It's still plenty thick enough to be sturdy so you'll be fine. I highly recommend it. It's by far and away the best screen protector you can get for the honor 8. I do know that for sure.

It gives the same exact protection that all the others do. What I'm saying is I don't believe how thick a screen protector is actually is the reason your real screen doesn't crack on a drop. Any real screen with any of the other thicker protectors is still going to crack under the right drop conditions. The screen protector I believe absorbs the impact therefore taking the brunt of the drop hence it cracking instead of the real screen cracking. How thick it is I personally don't believe makes a difference on whether or not your real screen shatters. As long as you have protection of some sort will be enough to save your real screen from a drop and just the opposite. If you drop it just right and hard enough no screen protector is going to save your real screen. If that's the case we all need back tempered glass protectors too due to the back being totally glass.

We ultimately chose a .4mm thickness, which is about the thickness of four sheets of paper. This is only slightly thicker than most glass screen protectors on the market, but it makes a big difference when it comes to impact protection. \nAs thickness increases, the strength of the glass goes up exponentially, which means it doesn't take much to add a significant amount of durability. \nHere\u2019s some quick math to help you understand: BodyGuardz Pure\u00ae is .4mm thick, and most competitors\u2019 glass is .32mm thick. To better illustrate this, we\u2019ll give the Pure\u00ae a thickness of 10, and the competitors\u2019 glass a thickness of 8. \nTo determine strength, we take thickness to the third power. For the Pure\u00ae, 10x10x10=1,000. For the competitors\u2019 glass, 8x8x8=512.

The one I have been using and highly recommend is 0.2 in thickness so it's definitely thinner than the average screen protector. Personally I still think it will be plenty enough thick to protect the screen as I think that any screen protector could fail due to just the right drop and impact as it's not a guarantee that any of them give you 100 percent protection. That is good to know though and something to consider. I've used the one I've been recommending for quite a while now but I've never dropped my phone so I have no way of saying for sure if it's enough to prevent your real screen from cracking. The way that I look at it is more from a protection from scratches to the screen over the protection against a drop because every drop is different. You never know how your phone will hit when it drops and therefore any screen protector could potentially fail. I like not having a halo on my screen too so this particular screen protector is definitely my choice for the honor 8 over the tons of others I have tried. I think even though it's a little thinner it will still give you some sort of drop protection which is good enough for me personally. Plus it protects from scratches which would drive me crazy just as the halo does too so I'll be sticking with the one I recommend but now that you have disclosed that thickness does indeed play a factor in protection that now I can't say the one I use and recommend is the best hands down anymore but if you want average protection that leaves zero halo then I'd get the one I use which is the thinner one. It's the only one I've seen on Amazon to be this particular thickness but it also states that it gives you high impact protection which now sounds to be subjective. That's a tough call but I'm going to stay with the one I've been using due to the no halo it gives you and I still get some form of protection but just not at the highest level. Depends on what's more important to you about the halo I suppose. I remember using some that gave the halo and I just didn't like it all that much so when I discovered this one I have been recommending it thinking that that all screen protectors gives the same amount of drop protection. Now that being said I'd change to a thicker one if I could find one that didn't give you the halo but I don't think that exists. I believe due to the less than typical thickness the one I have has is why mine leaves no halo. So it now depends if the trade off is worth it to one or not. It's worth it to me but then again I've never dropped my phone and I especially hope I don't drop it just right on a hard surface now. I should knock on wood lol. I like mine much better than any of the others I've tried so I'll stick with it.

I honestly don't think it does. I think with the honor 8 being all glass any of us whether we are using a thick or thin protector will be lucky if we drop our phones on a hard surface that some part of this phone won't be cracked. Just like i know I'm asking for trouble when I don't use a case. The skin I order may give some shatter protection but I doubt it. Then it widely depends on how the phone hits the hard surface on whether the real screen cracks or not. I know with this protector I'd personally be more worried about my back cracking on a drop over my screen as I just don't think it has to do with how thick but rather how you drop it and what you drop it on. But yeah someone do a Google search on whether or not if thickness of a tempered glass protects better than one that is thinner which may give us all the best answer. I like this protector bc it leaves no halo so I'll definitely continue to use it. I however might now since I've spoken about it order a back tempered glass to protect my back from cracking from a drop now. This screen protector I think though is definitely sufficient as I'm sure it's gone through production testing before it was ever released to the public for sale. Plus is kind of pricey compares to other tempered glass on Amazon so I'm betting that it's not thick enough to withstand an average drop and will in fact save your real screen but the back would be what I'd worry about more than the front with this particular tempered glass. If they made one for the back from this same brand I would have ordered it too but I didn't see one. In fact I don't recall really seeing any for the back when searching for this one but it does come with a plastic film protector for the back too.

Take it to the sink and douse it with dishwashing soap and spread it evenly on the screen then grab a wrag and wet it and then proceed to pretty much scrub the back side of the protector while the soap is on there. Then after you've cleaned it well wash it off under the running water until all the soap is gone. Then dry the front side of it off with something but be sure you don't touch the wet back sticky side. Bang it a couple times on it's bottom edge to get as much water off as you can then take a credit card and swegee the rest of the standing water on the back sticky side off until dry. Then you now have a perfectly new screen protector ready to install. I know this works as I've done it several times in the past and I've done it twice with this one I just got from either something getting under the screen protector stuck on the sticky side or I've gotten fingerprints on the sticky side so I used the process on it I just explained and it's as good as new to reinstall.

Half of them are Red and the rest a mixture of different colors. All of them are thin low profile cases. Nothing with bulk. Ive gotten to where I prefer not to use a case bc I like the feel of slim the phone feels without one. So if I use a case it's got to be very slim and form fitting. I also only use the TPU rubber type cases. The only two cases that aren't are my two honor made clear cases that are the thinnest with the least protection which is what I use the most. It protects all four corners but has no impact protection like my slim rubber cases do. I just like searching for new cases that look good to me and that I know are thin and I'll typically order them but they have to meet my criteria before I would even consider buying one. I'm quite picky when it comes to my phones. The color of the phone is big time important to me as I've sold phones that I liked before bc it wasn't the color I really wanted. Also as I've learned Android I've become picky about which brand phones that I will consider using in terms of interface and smoothness. That's why I have always come back to the honor 8 this being my third time owning the phone. I know now that EMUI is my favorite Android interface to use which honestly I don't even really consider EMUI to even be Android bc when you compare it to all other Android phones it's nothing even remotely like Android at all. Especially EMUI 4.1 which im thinking about rolling back to as I liked it the best bc it was the most different than Android honor has offered yet. Each new update of theirs brings more and more of stock Android into play which I'm not in any way a fan of Android. I prefer Apple IOS ten fold over Android and thus another reason why I like EMUI as in a way it has some similarities to IOS but near as much as lots of people claim that it does. It's a hybrid type software unique to it's own formation meaning there is nothing quite like it. So you really cannot compare EMUI to Android nor IOS because it's really neither of the two. It has it's own unique and different signature. That's why I believe that 4.1 could have been branded and marketed as it's own and third major software choice to Android and IOS had Huawei honor wanted to go that route but I know it would be way too expensive and time consuming to build an entire new eco system around EMUI so their only choice was to lump it in with Android and make it compatible to the Google play store. If I had to choose between Android, IOS or EMUI I would definitely choose EMUI and I do believe once Huawei honor comes to the US that EMUI will have a huge cult like following of people who prefer it over stock Android. Almost every review I see about the honor 8 the reviewer has something negative to say about EMUI but what they fail to say all of them is why. I think just bc it's big time different they automatically think it's bad bc it's not stock Android but I say to them what is so imnensley great about stock Android which is sticky and choppy when these companies bogging it down with their own skins where Huawei honor manage to place their more than very heavy skin on Android but yet it still runs as smooth as IOS with no lag and not choppy and sticky at all like most others are. They've optimized the software extremely well or they've totally done something different than the other Android skins have on all the other phones. The only phones that run as smooth as EMUI is the pure Android experience like the Nexus 6p or the what took the place of the 6p which is the pixel in which it runs as Google states like Android was intended to run in its natural form without any type of skin on it and I can tell you from owning the Nexus 6p that it ran like butter no lag no choppy or sticky but fluid just like EMUI does so Huawei Honor has definitely done something different since their skin runs butter smooth compared to all other skins out there. Look at Samsung touchwiz. That's the most laggy choppy sticky Android experience you can get but everyone seems to love them. Makes no sense to me. When you can use pure Android and get that IOS like interface or use EMUI and get it too so all these people who say EMUI needs a Nova launcher does not make any sense unless you are just a die hard stock Android fan which I'm not and I welcome change and to be different and unique standing out of the crowd instead of blending in. That's why Huawei honor will end up becoming number one once they establish themselves here in the US which is one of the most powerful markets in the world. Once they gain popularity here watch how fast they shoot up to number one in the world over taking Samsung at the top. I'm frustrated with Huawei honor right now bc they are totally neglecting the US from some awesome phones that we all would love the opportunity to buy and use. In not even sure now that they will even release another honor flagship here to replace the honor 8 nor am I convinced that they will follow through with their two year promise of updates that would and should give us Oreo now so if they don't start realizing they do have a strong customer base here and continue to leave us out then I'll for sure go back to Apple and they will loose me as a faithful supporter and customer.

I don't think we will see it any time soon but that we will sure get it now after I posted the question on XDA. My thread consist of everyone stating that it's a definite that we will in fact receive the major update. I can tell you guys from having recently owned the 6p that Oreo is very nice. It's better than nougat and appeared to be optimized much better. Settings were a different color and it grouped them up to show less settings but to open one up lead to more detailed setting features. It just cleaned up the settings. There were a couple of other things I noticed but I don't recall right this second. If I think of them I'll post it here. I had gotten a flat out steal on a brand new 6p but it's so big I just couldn't use it as my daily driver so I sold it and doubled my money on it. The 6p and the honor 8 are my two most favorite Android phones. I can tell you that pure stock Android is truly like butter. As Google states it's Android ad Google intended Android to run. Which is without any skin that bogs the UI down which in turn gives you that choppy and sticky lag you get with most Android phones. The only other phone that I've used in Android without any choppy lag is the honor 8. EMUI is just so different and totally unique and it's remotely nothing like pure stock Android like you get on the 6p and pixel devices. Pure android also gives you way less added features as it's truly vanilla in terms of interface. That's why I like EMUI so much. Huawei somehow optimized their skin not to big down the UI and to still run just as smooth if not smoother than pure stock Android plus with EMUI you get a ton of ways to customize your phone where you don't with pure stock Android. Some have even called pure android dull but it was ever so smooth. If I were not to use a honor 8 I'd probably go with the 5 inch pixel 2 as I do not like what these companies are doing now these days with the screen ratios. They are making them 18.9 which makes the phone way too narrow therefore the proportion is just off and weird. I know bc I had bought the Samsung S8 and I could not stand it. Plus it still lagged even with a 835 chip in it. I like the honor 8 ten times better than the S8 but these 18.9 screen ratios make zero sense to me. All they are doing is taking away screen real estate from both sides and making the phone taller and it's odd watching a movie in that ratio. The 16.9 typical ratio is the best and I just think it's a fad right now that will soon go away. It's just looks to be totally off and the screen is way too narrow.", "time": "11-01-2017 02:14 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6048646", "text": "Since you want one small phone, the honor 8, why didn't you keep the 6p as your larger phone for media consumption, since they are both your two most favorite phones?", "time": "11-01-2017 10:50 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6049199", "text": "Well I had to sell the 6p to fund the honor 8 as my second device would not sold high enough to fund the honor 8.

I thought I'd be okay with the 32g but I really wanted the Pearl white since I've owned the blue and the black before and in a 64g. Today I was able to talk B&H into coming down to $199 on that pearl 64g so I did pretty good as far as price and what I paid for it.

It became expensive and I had owned the honor 8 before so I knew I liked it enough for it to become my long term daily driver but reading all these posts that states doubt that we will see Oreo update was a huge let down to me if this were to be true. I just don't see Huawei honor making a poor business decision like that and not following through with their initial promise to the US customers that bought this honor flagship. Especially with Huawei honor not far from entering in the US full blown. That would mean they would have let their entire US customer base down then entering in to the US on a bad note. That being said I think we will get it but it will come very late to us. Plus they've yet to even release any info on their next US devices to be released if there even are any which again would be a bad US business decision. I hope we do get the update even if it's late coming. I also hope they continue to release at least one honor flagship device like the Honor 8 and one Huawei device like the Mate 9. I just don't see them letting down their entire US customer base they've built and not follow through with their two year updates promise. They did not become number two in the world based off poor business decisions. They've stated that they are definitely entering in the US market sometime soon but they've also stated that the US is not high on their priority list according to an article I read a while back so I really don't know what to expect at this point. If they don't follow through with their two year promise on the honor 8 they will loose me as a faithful customer and Huawei Honor is my favorite company too.

I've been thinking about returning this one and upgrading to a 64g but I can't decide. I've got 30 days to decide but in reality 32g with a 64g SD card should be sufficient long term don't you guys think? Tell me your thoughts on that and what you think I should do. Other than apps and these themes that's all I download. I stream music and movies so in theory long term I should be okay with the 32g plus I only paid $199. That's a pretty good deal to throw away. I just cannot decide bc I really wanted the sapphire blue color in a 64g. That being said I really don't think I'm going to need the 64g and I can easily live with the black color I got. Tell me or advise me as to what to do. If I did return this one I'd have to wait until black Friday to ensure I get a good deal on a 64g bc I'm on a tight budget so is it even worth the trouble of doing that or having to wait until black Friday to get my other honor 8? I need some advice big time on what I should do.

I stumbled across a theme earlier tonight that I think I'm going to use for a bit as I initially just liked the background color as it didn't preview the icons before I downloaded it. Turned out that the icons were extremely unique and different looking. Like 3D art of some type. I'm using it now and I think I'm going to actually stick with it for a little while as it's the coolest one I've found yet. I found another app for EMUI that has 100s of fonts which will be my next addiction until I find the perfect font to use. Right now I think I'm using a font called rosemary as it's more of a handwriting font which I tend to like over the stock regular font. When I used the Samsung S7 and S8 I used a font by Dave Gibbons that is my favorite font I've ever used and I actually found the apk file for it but it ended up not being compatible with the honor 8 so my font search will continue since I've got well over a 100 plus to choose from. I still like comic sans but I'm open to others too. Here's a pic of that theme and icon pack I stumbled across earlier tonight.

Not once in my three times owning this phone have I ever even thought about putting Nova on my honor 8 phones. It's always been straight up stock for me but however I do use Nova on my Android devices. EMUI isn't Android to me. In fact it's nothing remotely like Android other than they had nowhere else to place it at bc Apple would never had let them in their eco system so they had no choice but default to Android. You'd be in shock if you knew how many article type posts I've made about how EMUI could have easily had been branded has the mobile industrys third major software choice offered to consumers. That's just how totally different they are compared to stock Android. EMUI is actually more like IOS compared to Android but Apple would have never ever allowed EMUI in on their software system. Android was EMUIs only choice as to where to be placed. Android is all about customization so even though EMUI is nothing like Android we see it today in Androids eco system. I've heard so many say it's too much like IOS and I disagree. It's a hybrid type software with a little bit of both flavors and then they add their own twist in it too. That's why you won't ever find anything remotely like it. I know if I had my choice between Android, IOS and EMUI that I'd pick EMUI all day long and that's a true testimate to just how extremely different it over the two others. I absolutely love it. I'm a die hard EMUI fan. It's a blast to use every day and I never get tired of it.

Although I know a lot about specs of phones and know how to do a few other things I've never tried flashing a new firmware to a phone before mainly due to how many steps it takes and it seems like it's a pain. With 4.1 though which was how I initially learned to use EMUI on it may be worth it in this case as I liked 4.1 much better than the current software the honor 8 is running now. 4.1 was even further away from stock Android and I personally am not a fan of Android at all. EMUI I love because it's nothing like Android and it's still butter smooth the very IOS like fluid. In fact I have an IOS theme installed on my honor 8 right now so all of my icons look like the iPhone. My wallpaper is IOS. My phone dialer has the circles like IOS. I'm a Apple die hard by heart but what I like so much about EMUI is that it's a hybrid software taking elements from both Android and IOS and mixing them together along with Huawei honors own twist to it making it like nothing else any of us has ever seen before on a smart phone. It's in it own league and could easily be branded as it's own major software. There is no way EMUI when stock like I use it is nothing like Android. The look. The feel. The settings. All of it is just highly unique and different as a whole. That's why I prefer it over everything else. It's very innovative and I don't understand why so many people don't like it. It's a very easy and smooth interface to use but they cover it up with like a Nova launcher. I've owned the honor 8 three times now and not once have I ever even thought about putting a different launcher on my honor phones. I use Nova for all of my other Android phones but not stock EMUI. I personally love everything about it and I don't personally see the hype behind it being like IOS except for the lack of the app drawer. I'm been now with the new software having the option to use a app drawer I still do not. I keep mine as near as like 4.1 as possible. I just don't understand why so many dislike EMUI unless they don't enjoy change. I welcome it so anything unique and different to me brings innovation to the table and innovation leads to better experiences which I like. That's a huge reason I'm a fan of Huawei honor because their company is widely built off innovation. The honor 8 is the only Android phone that I personally know of that allows you to mix and match themes, icons and fonts without a third party launcher. That to me is impressive. I've got my honor 8 set up just like an iphone at the moment which I enjoy changing it all up every once in a while. I've located several apps for EMUI that offer 100s of themes, several different icon packs and 100s of different font. Then all the themes have their own set of icons within the theme itself. Here's one of my favorite set ups so far. Check out the icons. They are like some type of wild 3D art work or something and I only accidentally stumbled across this theme because all I could see was the color of the wallpaper I happen to like. I didn't even know about the cool and wild icons it offered.", "time": "11-07-2017 06:16 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6059131", "text": "Sounds like you could try to down grade to emui 4.1", "time": "11-07-2017 07:56 PM", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post6059487", "text": "I personally liked 4.1. It's initially how I learned to use EMUI on so I would not at all be opposed to going back to 4.1. I also liked the colored icon notifications it gave you and I didn't mind the split screen either in regard to the pull down. If it we're an easy process I would probably go back to 4.1 just because that's what made me originally like EMUI so much. Plus I'm not a huge fan of stock Android which is why I have become to enjoy EMUI so much. It's still nothing like Android whether I go back to 4.1 or stay where I'm at. I still don't use an app drawer nor do I use a third party launcher. I like EMUI stock just the way it is. There is not anything out there remotely like it as it's highly unique and different which was what drew me to it in the first place. Plus the software is highly customizable too which is fun to change it up all the time. Like themes, icons, fonts and wallpaper.

Movies and media. Hard to think about paying that much for just a media device. I'd be better off saving up and getting the Mate 9 instead as a media device as it's now much cheaper.", "time": "11-12-2017 05:16 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6066758", "text": "You should try to play around with it in a store. 6.3in is big, but it's near bezel less display get that big screen in a smaller body tho", "time": "11-12-2017 05:37 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6066797", "text": "True but the 18.9 ratio that my S8 had really never grew on me. It made the screen viewing awkward and not in proportion to me which the Note 8 has that crazy 18.9 ratio too so I'm not really sure I'd like it all that much but saying that it seems all the companies other than Apple are adopting this awful type viewing ratio. Probably why if I do get anything it will be the iPhone. Even though it's smaller I'm used to it having used both the iPhone 6 and 6s so I know that size phone well and I liked it. Still that leaves me without a media device which I may end up getting another iPad especially if I get the iPhone 8 as they will be compatible for text messaging and face time. I've found that Duo works pretty good too though. I just like being able to text right from my iPad as I'm typically on it more than my phone when I'm at home. Apple just makes everything easier and flow better than Android does in those terms. To me I like those options which I guess is why I'm wanting to go back to Apple now. I initially came to Android out of curiosity which lead me to stick around over a year now bc I got into testing new phones out which was a lot of fun but since I'm done with that now I've been thinking of going back to what I know deeply the best and what I'm most used to which would be IOS. There is nothing on the planet more smooth and fluid than IOS. EMUI comes close which is why it's my Android phone of choice. The rest of Android except for pure Android meaning the pixel is choppy and sticky and not very fluid to me that I've found to be while testing so many different Android phones that I have.

I've tried all of them and dbrand uses 3m and I think 1080 ply which is the same material I've used in the past to wrap my interior dash components of my truck and the material is the best you can get. So it's very durable. Leaves zero residue and give you instant grip. I'd say the carbon fiber may give you a slight better grip but not by much. They wlso just came out with a new design called dragon something and the only thing is it's in a greyish black color but it has the best grip out of all of dbrand skins. It's textured. I've never used it bc it's not offered in Red or Blue which are the only two colors I've mainly used. I almost however decided to order the White carbon fiber for my new Pearl White honor but defaulted to red in the end. So there are three companies to choose from. Dbrand, Slick Wraps and Mighty Skins. Only dbrand and slick wraps makes skins for the honor 8. Out of those two I'd go for dbrand bc they use the 3m material. Best material on the planet. You'll like it and their cuts are are perfect where they don't hang over the edge nor are they too small to give full coverage. I think I paid with shipping for my skin from dbrand $14.95. Definitely go with them. They not only have the best reputation but they also make the superior product as you can never beat true 3m material. What color are you going to get? What color honor do you have. You can go on their site and choose the color of your phone then pick the skin so you can preview it before you order it which they are the only company that offers you that.", "time": "11-05-2017 08:04 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post6055976", "text": "Oh I didn't know it was that durable.

It depends though how you are with your expression of color. I personally like colors that pop and give a wow factor like brights reds, bright oranges and some blues. To me personally and I've had this combo before which was the red for the sapphire blue. You could also get like a white carbon fiber for the sapphire blue which would look killer to me but again when I look at colors I'm drawn to colors that are quite noticable and jump out at you. So your color will depend on your personality if that makes sense. I think when you use a skin and pick the color out that it's important to find the right contrast to compliment the sapphire blue in your case. So to me I'd look at orange, yellow, red, white or black hose same colors in a carbon fiber texture. All of those colors would make your sapphire blue stand out even more. I personally would go for the red but I also like reds and blues together as they to me contrast each other the best. \nIn terms of durability the drbrsnd is a thick 3m material so it's not paper thin. You'd have a hard time tearing it apart unless there was a cut already started on it. In other words by simply using it daily you're not going to wear it out and it will and should remain new looking through out the entire time you have it on your phone. Like I said 3m is the regarded as the best material on the planet and best of all I've done this several times before as I enjoy change so I'll order two or three different colors and swap them out every once in a while as you can take them off and stick it back on the sheet it came to you on and install another color on it. I'll probably end up ordering either a orange or a blue as my other color. In your case the blue probably would not look that good on that particular sapphire blue your honor is. I also don't think black would look good either. You want something that will bring out the true color of the awesome sapphire blue the phone is. I'm a visionary so I keep having this vision of the yellow contrasting against the color of your sapphire blue honor actually very nicely. I know for a fact it will look awesome but the question is does your personality fit the loud color of yellow? Orange would look absolutely killer too with sapphire blue. My Pearl White has more options of course due to it being that cream Pearl color so I'll definitely be ordering another color or two for mine to change the look up every once in a while. I love skins. They give your phone an entirely new look and it appears as if you got a new phone at only the cost of the cheap skin but definitely go with dbrand as you simply cannot beat 3m material. The hardest part will be choosing your color to best contrast with that awesome sapphire blue. If I had your color it would either be red or yellow but I'm a very expressive person so I like extreme colors that give a wow factor though. Everyone is different but I will say it totally protects your phone from scratches on the back and allows you to use it without a case bc you'll have instantly a better grip on it. Go on Dbrands site and choose the color of your phone and then pick the skin color and it allows you to preview what your phone will look like with the color you picked out. That's what I did with my Pearl color. I chose the red to be placed on it and it looked awesome in terms of contrast on the Pearl color.

I know they take 90 days to come in but I've recently been watching comparisons between the iPhone 8 and the Note 8 on YouTube and I think I've now made my mind up that I'll go for the Note 8 which does mean I'll probably keep my honor 8 if I get Note 8. I just am not sure I can use a 6.3 inch phone as my daily driver. That said I still might get a refund on my honor 8 because that will give me $500 gift card, a $200 gift card and another $200 refund for my honor which is $900 dollars that would in fact totally pay off my Note 8 all together and hence lower my bill with Xfinity. Plus I truly think the Note 8 will keep a better resell value than the iPhone 8 due to the iPhone 10 being released now. Lastly I'm in need of a larger screen device for media and movies. I still have my Axon 7 mini in the case I feel like I want to scale back down to a smaller phone at times. Then I'm highly curious if I'll end up using the S pen as I've never owned a Note before.

I mean it's just a font lol. It's not like the other party can see your font. I like comic sans and will I'm sure go back to it at some point but this one is not comic sans. I forget the name but its a handwriting font which I personally tend to like over the stock font. The cool thing is there is a ton of different fonts to choose from for the honor 8 to please everyone's likes. To me I see nothing wrong with comic sans other than most people think it's bad bc they read articles that say it bad. Just because the article says that it doesn't mean it's bad. It's just a viewpoint of the one who wrote the article. I find it to be odd that when people say comic sans is bad they follow it up by articles or public comments which in my eyes only feeds the bias part of the view point. Who cares if a writer thinks it's bad. That's one person's judgement I guess making others automatically to think it's bad too. Honestly I don't see what's wrong with it but I like the handwritten type font so that's what I typically use most of the time if the phone will allow for a font change. When I've used Samsung phones in the past I used a Dave Gibbons font that looks a lot like comic sans but his font doesn't get a bad wrap so I think it's a bandwagon effect.

It gave me a reason to sell it on Craigslist and begin to buy other new phones to test out. Hopefully I won't ever get that software glitch again with the one I've got coming that is to arrive on Saturday as I plan to pretty much stop testing new gear out and sticking with the honor 8 has my daily driver again long term or until honor releases their next US device which I believe will be the honor 8 pro for some reason.

It'll be very nice to finally have options on both honor devices and Huawei devices which I'm probably sticking with the honor devices because the honor 8 is hardly short of any other flagship out today. It's just that good. I'm definitely curious of what honor device we will see next which my prediction will be in early December before Christmas sales. I'm thinking the honor 8 pro for some reason but never the less we will soon get another honor US release within the next 2 to 5 months which are my thoughts.

I think that's what I needed to hear. I'm just so torn between going with the Xpreria and Honor right now. I guess my money being tied up for a few days is kind of a good thing as it'll allow me to think it over some more. One other phone that has just came into the mix is the regular Axon 7, but used. I wanted to stay away from used but I'm very close indeed on having enough to get this phone in like new in box used which would be kind of cool being that I already own the Axon 7 Mini. In fact I'm using it right now and it's fast become my reliable go to phone. You just get do much for so very little with the Axon 7 Mini. The same for it's bigger brother the Axon 7. I found a few on eBay that.i have contacted people over and I'm very close to being able to land one of those which I very well may do. You get a 2k full HD quad display, 5.5 inch display, 820 processor, 4k video, premium all metal build which I believe they coupled with B&W to design the phone and a ton of other flagship specs for a retail of $400 used around $275 to $300. I'm very tempted on that one even though I told myself to stay away from used phones now after being burned with this guy. No wonder he was not responsive until I bought it then became super nice after that. He was just praying I wouldn't notice which thankfully I did and for him to even try to take me makes me so mad. I kind lost my temper with him today while on the phone with him but I just got angry over me knowing he knew it as there is hardly even a chance something in shipping would make that phones screen look the way it did. What he was hoping I'd that I would stay off an all white screen but I kept seeing this haze at the bottom so that's when I decided to pull a white screen up and sure enough there it was and it was bad too. I just think that is so sorry for someone to do to another. He actually hoped that I wouldn't notice and sold me a defective phone. Which by the way ended up costing me about 75 dollars in accessories. So in the end like you said and I appreciate you saying it, maybe I should just go for the Xpreria X which by the way is on sale right now which White and silver is $229 and Black Graphite is $239. That's for a $450 dollar phone or basically these days a $350 to $299 dollar phone. It's not a bad price and like you said matches all of my accessories and on top of that the least expensive route to take. I don't know. I've got a couple days to think on it so hopefully I'll make the right decision bc I really do want another honor 8 but like now I just missed that awesome sale on jett.com for a 64g for $250!! I would have jumped on that but then again this darn guy has my money tied up in the refund process which he basically screwed everything all up for me. If not for his lying backside I'd be okay right now and I would have come out the best.

It feels really good in the hand, is super thin especially for a phone this size, and is a joy to use all around. Oh...and HSPA has been just fine...No LTE. \nMy favorite feature has been both its size and the screen. It is VERY vibrant, making it perfect for viewing content (news, articles, social media) and is even pretty good at productivity because of the screen size. Just today I was able to really edit a PPT I've been working on for a presentation without a hitch on the run. The size also makes it excellent for viewing and writing emails, something I do frequently.\nDrawbacks so far has been the camera and pocket-ability the size can at times can be noticeable when carrying in jeans, so there is the trade off. This will be a deciding factor on whether I'll keep this phone long term. Another drawback has been the notifications. I have EMUI on my regular Honor 8 and no matter what I do I can't get my notifications here like I have them on that device (it runs perfectly). I get some but still not all.

I could be wrong but the 8 has already out lived most other Android devices and is still going strong. I think if it gets Oreo then we won't see the honor 9 here in the US at all. With the potential of the 9 I think Oreo won't hit the 8. Like I said I could off the mark but it's just a gut feeling with what I know about Huawei Honor from being such a fan of them. I read a lot of articles on them. I love that they have went on record stating that they will indeed the number one mobile phone company in the world in a few years. I truly believe it too. I mean just take the honor 8 alone. It's their version of a budget device and simply put there is nothing about the honor 8 that is budget really. It does everything at a flagship level but yet you can get for under 300 bucks. That's why they will be number one as they have said. Plus they innovate. That's important too. As long as they don't come to the USA and all the sudden raise their honor prices to become greedy then they will definitely become number one easily. I have no clue why EMUI receives such a bad wrap from some people. What's not to like about it. We all know apple IOS is by far the smoothest interface on the planet. So what if EMUI is a little bit like IOS. To me EMUI is nothing like Android and it's not IOS either. It's in its own league and could easily be branded as a third major software choice within the mobile industry. It's unique and different but it's butter smooth like IOS. How could anyone not like that. Stock Android is just plain choppy and sticky. I'm sorry but it is and EMUI is not. So I guess you can call it a hybrid but Huawei did an awesome job with it's interface. You simply won't find anything remotely like it. So I'm not sure why some people dislike it so much. I think it's a bandwagon thing and they really do like it but have to say they don't bc they are an Android purist. Anyways I've sat here and basically talked myself back into wanting another honor 8 like really badly now lol. I get carried away when it comes to the honor 8. It's such a strong and well developed device for the money. I do know that there is not a better device on the market that even comes close to the honor 8 in terms of price point. It's so close to a flagship that one could not really even tell the difference and if they didn't know better would easily pay 500 for it. To be able to pick one up at 275 is amazing to me. I miss mine but I'm afraid I'm stuck with the Axon 7 Mini due to being such a long wait if I returned it then bought the honor and wait even longer for it to come in. What I think I'll do is keep my Axon since it's going to run 7.1.1 and then next month pick up an honor 8 to use some in rotation as I do like the Axon. It's a really premium build for 194 dollars. It's no different than the regular axon 7 in terms of build quality plus you add the Atmos Dolby surround sound speakers it has which are amazing alone by itself and to get it for under 200 is a steal. I wished it had a 625 processor compared to the 617 but it's not that big of a difference. It's still pretty zippy and the screen resolution I'd say has a slight edge over the honor 8 as its AMOLED. Color saturations are very good on the axon mini. They both have 5.2 inch screens.

It's a nice phone and I remember being swayed to buy the Axon 7 last December too!\nWith regards to EMUI, I agree with you. I really love the experience.

I remember thinking, \"I wish my lockscreen looked like X;\" and then with the update, it suddenly was! Haha.\nI think people sometimes get afraid or anxious about differences - or changes to things. So if something is suddenly different from what they're used to, it makes them nervous.\nYes, the Honor 8 is definitely one of the greatest bangs for your buck out there. It certainly does have flagship-level specs and potential. People pick up my phone and have no clue what it is - which I also like. At work, most of my co-workers have iPhones, and they marvelled that 1) it had a fingerprint scanner and 2) that it was at the back of the phone.\nI hope Honor does well and that their brand goes far.

I can deal with a 5.2 which is what this Axon 7 is and what the honor 8 is but I do like it better when is closer to 5 inches. As far as software interface and performance, the Nexus 6p was absolutely amazing to me. Perhaps becaus Huawei produced it. I'm sure that's why that phone was so utterly smooth for stock Android.

If it doesn't come with the original boxes then I won't buy it. Most of the Nexus 6ps I see don't have the box with them. Then there is the mate 9 that I have been wanting ever since it has been released. That's another option for my larger screen phone.

I do like smaller phone best as my daily driver but ever since I came over to Android I've become to appreciate a larger screen. Just like recently I went back to the iPhone SE and I literally could not handle it anymore. That 4 inch screen was way too small for me now so I sold it pretty quick and I'm a apple guy by heart. I just couldn't deal with that small of a screen anymore after using Android for a year and half now. The iPhone 5s used to be my favorite phone so I thought I'd love the SE. Not the case at all. Now my sweet spot is between 5 inches and 5.2. My larger screen is between 5.5 and 5.7 like the Nexus 6p was. I really enjoyed watching movies and YouTube on that phone. Even a 5.2 inch I don't mind watching a movie on but now I do like larger screens but only as my second device. I like a phone that I can easily use with one hand and put in my pocket as my daily phone. The honor 8 I could do that with still. Anything larger than 5.2 would be out of my what is considered to be my smaller device. That's why I had said I wanted the honor 9 being almost an inch smaller. Still though 5.2 I'm okay with. This axon 7 mini I'm using right now is 5.2 and it's just fine. If I do keep it then next month I'm definitely getting something that's 5.5 or 5.7.

Before my own business went under for many years I made around 12k to 13k a month. I thought that was a lot but it's nothing compared to 24k a month! That's insane money and only the elite get paid that type of money per month. So when I say he's a genius in his world he's literally the best in his field. Heck he wrote a security program that apple wanted so bad that they recruited him for 5 straight years until he finally caved at 24k a month. So this means he wrote a security program for apple as a hobby in which the biggest software company in the US could not write themselves which made them recruit him to get their hands on it for 5 long years. Think about it like this. He genuis enough to write a program which basically he was able to see that far into the future by 5 years of what apple wanted, needed but could not replicate themselves. This is because one he's either a genius in his field or at the very least the very best in his field and brilliant. No he's not a genius in everything as he came to me for real estate appraisal advice all the time which I often wondered how could one not know this just by common sense alone. This is another sign of a genius by the way. He was told by apple that they thought he was the very best in his field. Which he had to be if they were paying him 24k a month. That is an awfully lot of money to pay someone who is just good at what he does. He's better than that and I've seen it with my own eyes and heard it. There are times he talks to me and it sounds like an entirely different language and I'm actually somewhat tech savvy. I know absolutely nothing compared to him. So if he's a genius in his world I guess could up for debate or my opinion but there is no doubt he is at the very top of his field. Most of his certifications came from MIT. He made a 34 on the SAT. Two points from a perfect score. I just know he's brilliant in his world and he can do anything he wants when it comes to code and computers. Mobile tech included. He's also apple die hard. His name is listed in the development of the iphone 4 but I'm not going to mention his name for respect to him but apple consulted him on where the antenna needed to be placed in that phone which was well before they ever recruited him or he worked for them. They very well knew who he was already and well enough to consult with him on that part of the design phase. I've just seen him in action and so I've got first hand knowledge of what he can do and what he has done. We are good friends. We talk just about every day. I'll tell you it's even hard for me to get him to work on my phones bc he's either busy or he's got his own projects that he's working on.

I was just about to hit the buy button when a guy from the market place here called me. I took the call before I hit buy. So he had a pixel XL that he offered me for 350 but since my other phone hadn't sold I did not have enough to cover that plus I'm not a fan of how the Pixel looks anyway. We got to talking and come to find out he had three Nexus 6ps which is still to date my favorite Android phone I've ever used which of course I don't consider the honor 8 to be Android because it's nothing like it. So he happened to have a brand new Nexus 6p 64g still in the box plastic on it and everything. Never even turned on. He offered it to me for $150!!!! I was totally floored!! As much as I like the Nexus 6p when I had it before and being that I'm in the market for a larger screen phone I simply could not pass that deal up. The 64g used still go for $350 to $425! I got a brand new 64g Nexus 6p for $150 dollars! What a good guy to give me the deal of the century. I literally was about to hit the buy it now button on the honor 8 when my phone wrung which was him calling me. I had every intention to buy another honor 8 which the one I really wanted the guy never responded to me and I was a bit concerned with the light two scratches on this other honor 8 I was about to buy. Anyways this was a deal of a lifetime that I simply could not pass up. I use the Nexus 6p as a measuring stick to compare every Android phone I buy to. It's just that good of a device and who is it made by? Huawei!!! There is a reason the Nexus 6p for stock Android to run so smoothly and it's because Huawei produced that phone. So although I didn't get the honor 8 I still got a Huawei phone and one that is my all time favorite \"Android\" device I've ever used brand new 64g for only $150! I'm still in shock over this deal. I'll still definitely get another Honor 8 but it'll be in a couple months now. I've already got plenty of cases for the Nexus 6p and left over screen protectors for it. I could easily turn around and sell this 6p for around $400 bucks but I assure you that I'm not. He gave me such a good deal that I can't believe it. What a nice guy. I should have it the day after tomorrow as he is overnighting it to me. I stoked that it's the 64g bc there is no expandable storage on the 6p. When I owned one it was the 32g. This one is silver and white but I'm going to put a skin on it so the color didn't matter really except I didn't want gold. I'm not a fan of gold phones to be honest. So now I just filled the void of not having a larger screen device which the 6p is 5.7 inches and it will be great for movies and media. When I get the honor 8 that will be my daily driver as the 6p will be my second device or back up. I'm sure for the next few days I'll only use the 6p as it will be new to me but to use a large phone daily I can't do for long. My sweet spot for a daily phone is 5 to 5.2 inches. The honor 8 is perfect for a daily driver. Until then my axon 7 mini will be my smaller device as it's 5.2 inches as well. I'm still in shock at the price I got it for. He could not have called at a better time bc I was just about to hit the buy it now button on that honor 8 that had those light scratches on the screen. Great timing indeed. This guy had tons of phones. If anyone is looking for a steal on a pixel XL let me know. I can get back in touch with him as he offered it to me around $350 which is a awesome deal too.

I can get a really good deal on a Sony Xperia X Performance right now which that phone is indeed 5 inches which again is the perfect size to me personally for a phone.

Pretty cool. I know now so I will be streaming some NFL games moving forward with the Nexus 6p. The 5.7 inch screen is huge so it was easy to watch the game on with.

My biggest concern is reliability and overall quality. I've read some great user reviews about the Honor 8, but I've also seen issues around forums about connectivity issues, outgoing call issues, etc. I just want to make sure that the Honor 8 is, both, a cool, solid device, and reliable (won't bug out after 5 weeks, etc). Granted, it seems like a lot of the negative issues I've read about are before EMUI 5.0 came out, but I'm still weary. Can anyone share their experiences about owning an an Honor 8 - good, bad, and ugly?", "time": "07-03-2017 02:26 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5874763", "text": "You can't go wrong with the Honor 8 at all. EMUI whether it's 4.1 or 5.0 is at the top of any user interface experience on the market. In fact if you had a iphone 6s or iPhone in general, you find that EMUI is very much butter smooth and fluid like IOS as it's a hybrid software that is nothing like stock pure Android. The only reason I would say possibly wait on the honor 8 is bc the honor 9 is now released but not yet in the US. That said the honor 8 is still your best choice by far out the phones you mentioned. If you liked IOS you will very much like EMUI and also there are no bugs with either 4.1 or 5.0. Sure you'll read the bad experiences bc no one posts about how awesome EMUI is but I'm posting that it can easily be branded as it's own type of mobile tech software. It's just that different. Nothing about it indicates that it's Android. It's great and very fluid. If you are unable to wait on the honor 9 then you will be hard pressed to find a better device for the money. Good luck and update everyone with what you decided. You won't regret the honor 8 at all. The camera is amazing and fast. The 950 chip is really zippy and quick. Screen resolution is 1080p which is good. It is 5.2 so if you're coming from a 4.7 6s then you may find it to be pretty big. The honor 9 is actually a tad smaller at 5.1 which doesn't sound like a lot but in the real world is very noticeable to the feel. You can easily watch movies on it and browse the web. Read articles. You may enjoy the screen real estate more than you expect to. I know I did coming from exclusive apple up until a little over a year ago now. I recently went back to the iPhone SE as I used to love it but when I got it back after a year with Android sure I loved IOS but I could not stand how small the screen was and I quickly got rid of it. Now I use the Samsung S8 regular size which has a lot of screen but yet still a one hander. The honor 8 is pretty much a one hander most of the time. You'll definitely like it. Just try and find one on a good sale since the Honor 9 is now rolling out.

That is awesome! I'd buy one brand new in a second for that price. Right now I'm waiting for it to go on sale then decide if I'm going to get it or not. I'm also trying to wait on the Honor 9 to ever hit the US. I think that will be a good while. What I do like about the Axon 7 is the high resolution, all metal build (I love a device that is all metal), the 820 processor and then the camera is pretty good with lastly a good size battery. To me those are the main factors in deciding on whether I purchase a phone or not. The Axon 7 indeed has all those said features and makes it a device I would not mind and enjoy using. I actually just received my iPhone SE back after a brief trade for a Blackberry Priv which ended up having a faulty charging port. I'm happy in the end though as the iPhone is a great device and nothing I've found to date beats apples fluid interface. That said the iPhone SE is a very small device so I'm definitely in the market for another Android Phone that has a larger screen size. I've decided for now I'm going to hang on to my SE as it's a great phone to conceal and put in your pocket and what not. Plus it's zippy and has a good camera. I'm a long time apple user anyway which is one major reason I like EMUI so much. It's simply nothing like stock pure Android which compared to IOS is quite choppy and sticky overall. I'm not downing Android in any way as one of my favorite devices I've ever used was the Nexus 6p and it's more stock Android but to me it was very smooth interface wise. The reviews I've seen and the research I've done suggests that the Axon 7 to be a lot like the Nexus 6p in almost every aspect. That is another reason I'm considering getting it. I'd like to see what the Axon 8 has to offer too. Oh and I almost forgot about how awesome the sound system is on the Axon 7 too. People have held it to be the best on the market. I think I'm going to keep my SE though bc it's a handy device to use when you don't won't a huge Android device with a 5.5 plus inch display. It's hard to put that in your pocket and go. That said I do want a larger screen device to research and read articles. Watch an occasional movie on which the Axon has the high quad resolution for that. Then it's much easier to browse the web and read my fill of lots of articles which I enjoy doing. I crave knowledge so I spend a lot of time reading on my phones and the SE is quite hard to do that comfortably. I might start sub teaching high school as I used to teach college courses on the side. Teaching at a actual high school I think the SE will be perfect to keep in my pocket and conceal as opposed to the trying to lug the Axon 7 in my pocket all day teaching. I typically keep two devices one small and one larger. To me the ideal screen size is 5 inches. That's is what is drawing me to the honor 9 as they have brought it down to 5.1 inches from 5.2 which real world is very noticeable to feel. \nTo comment on people buying new devices to me big time varies on the person. I find it to be a hobby and I enjoy learning a new interface so for me I have gone through a lot of Android devices for only having been using Android now for a little over a year. It's fun to me but it can become very expensive too so I've cut back a lot and I actually used my Honor 8 exclusively for quite a while for me anyway.", "time": "06-29-2017 04:10 PM", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post5868235", "text": "Yeah it was such a good price but in the end I cancelled the order because it didn't work on Verizon plus I have too many phones and while $277 is a great price, my s8+ was $350 on contract which isn't much more.

My mistake earlier as I thought you said you disliked 4.1 vs 5.0 but I see where you said 4.0 which I'm not familiar with. I came to honor when it had 4.1 which I liked a lot. I believe I liked it a bit better than 5.0 but only because it was further away from stock Android which I do not like really all that much. Stock pure Android to me is rather choppy and sticky if you go pure stock. \nI 100 percent agree with you about the camera. The honor 8 has a very high end camera. Now that I have the S8 with it's killer camera I now see just how great of a camera that the honor 8 has that I definitely took for granted all that time. \nYou're also very right about the honor 8 having quite a few flagship specs at a mid range price. This is another reason I keep coming back to it. I really see no need for me to have all this money tied up in my S8 when I can get the 64g Honor 8 when it's on sale for around $300 vs $750 for my S8 that I oh so badly had to have. Don't get me wrong. The S8 is an awesome device but so is the Honor 8 at under half the price. \nGreat review again and congrats for being chosen to have the honor to get to review the Honor! I found your review to be very thorough and deep with knowledge. My hat is off to you and nicely done. \nLastly EMUI to me is just so vastly different than Android. To me it's not even the same software. The interface is completely different but to me that's a very good thing. I find EMUI a joy to use and it's also very fluid. Very smooth. Some say it's a lot like IOS and in a way I could be but I think it's a hybrid software falling in between Android and IOS so it's in a league of it's very own to me. I am one to easily think it could be branded as a third mobile software choice within the mobile tech industry which I'm sure to some that sounds extreme but just wait until Huawei does officially it's here in the US and signs up with the four carriers. Watch how fast they will grow and have their cult like following of EMUI and how they will rival Samsung just because of EMUI. It's just that different. A lot can happen in the next three years so I maybe totally wrong but I see them surpassing Samsung here by year two or three of being here.

And I find the 5.2 inch display to be the perfect size.\nAt first I didn't really know about the EMUI. It's very IOS like IMO. But I think I like it. It's like having the best of IOS and android in one device. From the former it's VERY smooth and from the latter it's also very customizable. But to me.The best things are the all the tricks this thing has up it's sleeve like the finger print button, it's split screen features, dash buttons, gestures, etc. \nBattery life is great, camera I really haven't tested.\nIn short this it's a SOLID phone. It may be categorized as a mid ranger but nobody told Huawei that, as it really is a flagship like device. This phone is so good it makes me think of buying an Mate 9 in time. \nLast thing. One thing this phone had taught me is that with the right \"mid ranger\" companies like Honor or Oneplus there's no need to buy a super expensive $80\" phone unless u just want to.

After a brief (and rather alarming) bout with some snow and water in January, I thought the Honor 8 was done for, but after some percussive maintenance (of all things!), I was able to continue using it. It has been a rather hardy phone; surviving falls, drops, and dunks in water (even without an IP rating of any sort), and I am quite fond of its resilience.\nHowever, all good things must come to an end, and no industry better exemplifies this than the smartphone industry. After a particularly hard drop onto concrete from about 5 feet in the air, my Honor 8 landed (in a case) on a corner, and cracked along the top bezel. The crack did not, however, go over any important components such as the camera or proximity sensor, nor did it encroach onto the screen. Thankfully, the phone is still very functional, and the damage was simply aesthetic.\nWhat\u2019s my plan now? Well, because the damage is just aesthetic, I\u2019ll simply fix the aesthetics. I\u2019ve ordered a tempered glass screen protector that has coloring along the bezels, so the crack will be covered up (and yes, I know, I should have been using a tempered glass screen protector from the start, but the matte looked so nice, especially for reading e-books). I plan to continue using the Honor 8 for at least another school year, however, that decision will heavily depend on how it fares for the rest of the summer. I may buy a battery case, as the battery is beginning to show signs of usage. However, all in all, the Honor 8 has held up very well in terms of performance, sturdiness, and usability, and I am looking forward to continuing using it for a long time.\nHow's your Honor 8 holding up?

I've tried to be more than several times with as many devices as I've tested but I always gravitated to EMUI which of course I've heard many say it to be a lot like IOS.

So even with it being still 5.2 you feel comfortable as it being small enough to be your one hander device? My hands are of average size for a guy who's 5'11 185 pounds and I just feel like 5.2 is a little big for a true one hander. 5 inches or smaller is I deal for me. Had it not been for price I'd had owned both the Pixel and S8 which are close in size I seem to believe being under 5.2. I think the Pixel is 5 inches to be exact. So although I think 4 inches is too small I still went ahead and picked up a 5s iPhone which will be here tomorrow. What I believe I'm going to do though is wind up selling the 5s and getting the iPhone SE back which has better performance. I got my old cases out tonight of when I had my SE and 5s and wow do they feel good in one hand. I'm looking forward to seeing if I can remember my iCloud password and checking out what is it now 10.2 IOS compared to 9.something back when I had my iPhone 6s last. I should have gotten the SE to begin with but I wasn't all to sure I was swapping back over to IOS entirely but now I see where cricket whom I use is selling the iPhone SE for just $199 but locked to them only which for me isnt a problem since I already use them and I'm not going anywhere. It may force me to sell my Honor 8 but if I'm going to swap I'm going all out. Not half way. All in or nothing. So my plans are to quick sell my new Honor 64g if anyone wants a deal PM me and buy the SE for $199 at Cricket this weekend I believe and just trade in my 5s which trade value isnt far from what I paid for it. Sony was another consideration but they are doing away with their X line so that put them out and the compact device is going away too. Plus Sony is way over priced. I got my like new 5s for $129. I can get a brand new SE for $199. To me now since I'm craving a true one hander the SE will be in my future very soon. For my large device I'll probably go with the Mate 9 still once it finally goes on some type of sale down from $599 which having used the Honor 8 so long now I see no reason to spend that type of money on a phone again. If they made a 4.7 Honor 8 that would be the device I'd have. I'm looking for 5 inches or less so the only phone I can think of that truly is worth it is either the 5s or SE iPhone which to me I do not mind IOS at all interface wise.

Reception wise the top two are Verizon and AT&T. I should say coverage wise. That is why I chose cricket as they run off AT&T towers and I've had excellent service and coverage since I made the switch well over 6 months ago now. I just traded my iPhone SE for a Blackberry Android Priv. It should arrive today as it was suppose to have arrived yesterday thanks to awful USPS. Anyways I do go through a lot of devices as I enjoy testing them out and posting about the experience. It's become expensive so I'm going to slow it down. I'm actually down to one device now as I used to keep two at all times. I'm getting better. Devices I still want are, the Mate 9, Samsung S8 regular and now I'm interested in the Honor 9 as I read it is smaller by a tad than the Honor 8. It's like 5.1 as opposed to 5.2 which does not sound a big difference but in real world it's quite noticable to me. Before I was exclusive to apple being that I'm 41 I was a Blackberry addict. I saw and went through their devices during the time when they were at the top or height of the market place. In fact I did not swap over from Blackberry until well after the release of the iphone 5. Even then I didn't want to swap but my last Blackberry which was touch screen with a physical keyboard which that is my addiction bricked on me so I made the change over then. Had it not bricked I'd probably have stuck with Blackberry until at least the iPhone 6 most likely. Anyways the Blackberry Priv has the physical keyboard that slides out so I'm super excited to see how fast that keyboard comes back to me as I seriously used to could type on that keyboard with my eyes closed I knew it so well. Of course it remains to be seen whether I fall back into Blackberrys grip again but I definitely was addicted to them for many years. Then iPhone up until the 6s and after about 6 months with it is when I decided to finally try out Android. I'm still personally not a fan of pure stock Android though. It's not refined and it's to me, choppy and sticky (not fluid). IOS and EMUI though are very fluid and they are smooth interface wise. I still will use stock Android but it's not my favorite software experience. I'm quite sure I'll end up getting the Honor 9 once it finally is released to the US which I don't see that happening any time soon. Huawei Honor is going to support their loyal fan base first before they get to the US. Soon though next couple of years they will be here with all the major carriers and I see them sky rocketing to the top and 3 to 5 years passing Samsung up. Their software interface and innovation is just superior in every way and it will reflect here in the US given the correct timeframe. Someone said I go through a lot of devices lol and I do. It's fun to test and change up all the time. To me I loved the Honor 8 but the best overall device I've used during my android time and I've gone through a lot of devices was the Nexus 6p. I actually still may pick up another one as that device by far and away has been my favorite one I used. The only reason I let mine go was that I grew tired of such a large device. I regret it now which is why I plan to pick up another. It's in every way a Pixel at half the cost and I may get flack on that but it's the honest truth. I've seen many YouTube comparisons and for the most part they did exactly the same thing and they both did it good. Google just placed their name on the 6p tweaked it some and charged $850 for it. That is truly what Google did. I'll definitely be back to honor as it became my daily phone for a long while at least for me anyway but even with my honor I was ready to test out new or other devices. The iPhone SE i got ended up being too small as I got used to the Android size devices. The Priv is 5.4 inches so that's a good size that will allow me to actually watch some movies and then when I'm browsing the web I'll have all that extra space without the virtual keyboard to be in the way. I can't wait to get back to the physical keyboard and get that responsive feel again. I hope I stick with it for a long while but like someone said, I do go through a lot of devices. Oh and one more I want to try is the Axon 7 and Axon Mini. Those or at least the Mini is in my near future. The mini is on sell for 199 so it's a good price point actually and I've read it's a pretty good device with great audio.", "time": "06-21-2017 06:39 AM", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"postID": "post5855227", "text": "honor phones only work with CDMA. if they support Verizon's lelte bands then there is a chance they might work.

Now I'm quite unsure of what to expect so in a way I feel like I need to keep the Z Play just in case they don't honor my warranty for faulty software. You guys know I've posted here quite a while and know my enthusiasm for Honor and EMUI but after reading the posts and then finding out that the software error I have isn't just specific to me rather it's happening to quite a few others opens up quite a bit of doubt now. So either way I go I'm still out $399 but that being said I do like the Z Play. EMUI no doubt is still my favorite and my first choice. My expectations that I'll get a rightful warranty are now not very high. So I guess it's two fold. Yes the honor 8 is one of the best devices out there but at the same time you also possibly get what you pay for too but I hope I'm wrong about that. You get a awesome deal on a premium device new but when it comes a time that a true warranty is needed then the reports I've read have suggested just as I stated that you in that regard get what you paid for. So I'm going to stay with my Z Play and if honor replaces or repairs my phone rightfully then I guess I'll have two good devices to swap back and forth with. Overall I did not have any intention of buying another phone as I've loved my honor since day one. I just can't take the chance now after reading the negatives about their warranty.

Yes indeed you are exactly correct. I've had my honor 8 I'd say since November of last year. I've been a frequent poster hear on this forum and I've even won a contest which I had no clue that I was even competing in for my posts/articles you could say that were in full support of this device. Yes, I'm very frustrated not only with what I've read but the entire deal that they honor expects me, one who has promoted their device and praised their product to go without a phone instead of just replacing my unit under warranty so I'd not have to go without nor would I had to go out and buy a new phone to enable me to send my honor out. Now I've spent $399 on the Moto Z Play which I do love and honor may now have very well lost my loyalty. My issue is clearly from what I researched a common software issue and isn't just specific to me which is why I feel they should have just sent me a replacement with a return label for my defected device. Most likely I will not buy the Honor 9 nor the Mate now. Honor or Huawei no doubt had all the tools to rival Samsung head to head with EMUI being their smoking gun but where they will fail I see now is where Samsung shines through which is after sales service and customer appreciation. This plays a major role for me if I'm to be retained as a returning or repeat customer. So in a way honor has lost my business. I do miss EMUI as it is butter smooth compared to stock Android but stock Android isn't horrible enough for me not to use it. I've still got to jump through hoops just to be issued a return number still yet. So I've not even begun the process but I will eventually. I'll keep everyone posted and I hope your honor does not get the software glitch mine and so many others have gotten that ironically are specifically the same defect. It's why Samsung has already proven their after sales commitment where honor hasn't hasn't recognized this to be a widely common issue that I know they know to be true. I sure hate that because I truly thought honor had the best mobile tech software on the planet. EMUI is just that good and it's definitely nothing like the choppiness of stock Android. It's highly unique and totally 100 percent different. It's in it's own category to me and I've written a lot about this topic since owning the honor 8. Even my tablet is EMUI as I have the Med Pad 3 which is by far the best hidden secret tablet on the market with the exception that it's not offered in celluar. I use mine daily and I've owned several iPad pros and it to me is a better and more smooth tablet. To anyone who has not tried it, you simply are missing out on one of the top three tablets currently available on the market. Screen resolution is much higher then 1080p, it's ratio is 16.9 so although it's 8.4 inches it views as it it were a 9.7 inch tablet, the sound system on the tablet is amazing and the 64 gig comes with the best fitting earbuds I've ever used. It's my daily tablet so I'm not shunning it like I very well may have to do the phone. Time will tell with me as I may give honor another chance but it'll be down the road after I've enjoyed my Z Play for a long while as I love the mods. Plus I'm getting used to the 5.5 inch screen the Z Play has now. I've watched several movies and the JBL speaker mod is flat out awesome. Don't even get me started on the unbelievable battery life the Z Play has!! It's by far the best on the market. It's almost impossible to even try to drain this battery down. Then if I decide to use my Tumi battery mod with it I seriously can go 4 days without even thinking about a charger. So maybe it's a good thing after all. Time will tell but I'll keep you guys posted on how their warranty department handles my defect. My situation and it's outcome will give everyone if you the correct insight that you need to make an educated decision about Honor and if you stay with them or choose another brand. I clearly have a software issue that should be clearly taken care of no questions asked so once I let you know the outcome it'll tell you weather honor is worthy of staying loyal to or not.", "time": "05-17-2017 07:09 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5819204", "text": "Thank you for your post! For sure, it's very frustrating. You would think they'd just give you a replacement ASAP, especially if it's a known issue and not just something random like you dropped it or it suffered water damage.\nI definitely agree with you about Samsung's customer support. After the Note 7 incident, they truly showed up for their customer base and did their very best to keep everyone happy. It was definitely a lose-lose situation but Samsung did a really good job of trying to not only contain the situation but give their customers a break too. With such exceptional customer service elsewhere, sometimes it's easy for one to jump ship.\nAhhh the Moto Z Play sounds great! I definitely envy you for waiting four days to charge your phone with the help of a mod lool. It's truly a great phone that I think is underrated.

I was on their site the other day reading about it. It appears to be a very good device and as many phones as I've tested and been through, HTC is one that I've never bought. I've heard that they make a good one and this one looks to be awesome. It's pricey though from what I recall. I think they had a special for $50 off which made it $599. I've got so used to devices on deals that ever since I swapped and bought the 6p at a pretty good sale price, that I've not paid more than $400 for any device since then. I really have never been a fan of Samsung simply because I cannot stand their software which to me it's sticky and choppy. However I handled the S8 not the plus but the regular and I fell for it immediately. The looks and feel of the device. I have to say that model might be one that I'd be tempted to buy unlocked and just deal with touch wiz as visually and feel wise that phone is killer! I'm in the process of changing careers and there is a possibility I might go to work with AT&T so if that comes to fruition, then that S8 maybe what I end up with. I couldn't put it down at best buy the other day. I loved it. It was the perfect size too. I'm not a huge fan of my daily phone being much over 5 inches. About 5.2 max I'm fine with and the Z Play being 5.5 has been tough getting used to as I like a one hander phone for daily use. I typically keep two phones up until recently and my second phone was always a larger screen phone. So this Z Play may very well turn into my second phone at some point especially if I'm able to get the S8 at a discount if I end up working with AT&T. I think that phone is going to do really well. It was so nice to handle. I also liked that the curved sides weren't as overly curved as what Samsung has been doing too. So I've got that one in the back of my mind but I just don't know if I can bring myself to pay that much for a device with so many like my Honor 8 or this Z play going for $400 and under though.

I'm running stock EMUI 4.1.\nIf I have too many apps opened and stored in RAM (like 5+ or so; such as fb, messenger, email, youtube, instagram, ...), it often causes restart of the apps while switching between these apps I have already opened and stored in RAM. Even if it shows I have 1,5 GB RAM free. What's the point in high RAM capacity in phones (3-6 GB thesedays) when even with that much RAM (and that much FREE RAM) the phone isn't able to hold them really \"opened\" in RAM all and the apps \"reloads\" (as if it was launched for the first time) when you try to recall/launch them (quickly, but still).\nIt doesn't bother me that much generally, but only with one app - GPS tracking apps. After some time (maybe 1-2 hours) it always \"drops\" the app from RAM (it's still in recent apps though) therefore deleting my existing workout and tracked route. It's annoying. And yes I have the tracking apps selected in \"protected apps\". It happens still. Once I rebooted the phone, cleared apps stored in RAM so the only app running was Runkeeper. I went cycling and after some time (1-2 hours) I stopped, took the phone out of pocket, turned the display on, clicked on the GPS tracking app and it started to reopen/reload itself and once it reopens -> no trace of my existing workout, everything was gone. All of that with ~2.2 GB of free RAM.\nWhat good does 2.2 GB of \"free RAM\" do when the phone isn't able to keep the only running app in the background for few hours? I tried many GPS tracking apps, happens always. It didn't happen with my Moto G (1st gen.; 2013) with 1 GB of RAM, but it happens with a lot newer and better phone with 4 GB of RAM?\nAny tips for that, anyone?

For some reason I still may think it's the app shutting itself down once a certain time has lapsed. I've had similar if I didn't keep it on the the work out screen it would eventually shut itself down for I suppose non useage it thinks. Have you tried the honor fitness app yet? I know mine runs non stop has it tracks my steps through the entire day. Never shuts down. Try that app and see just see if it remains active for testing purposes as you may not like the app. It will rule out why some are shutting down if it doesn't. The other thing I think of is you're running 4.1 still and if you updated to ,5.0 it may change and fix your entire problem. I personally was against 5.0 but to be honest it's not really that much different than 4.1 but very very minor changes. I bet that plays a role.

Unknown to me to begin with, some of these appointments subsequently disappeared from my calendar meaning I've missed several client follow ups over the past month (NOT good for business!!). Once I realised this was happening I started paying attention and on one occasion I left the office in town having booked 3 follow ups and by the time I got home 20 min later, all 3 had disappeared from the phone. But it's not every appointment that vanishes and appointments I make when I'm at home (on wifi) don't disappear.\nIn desperation I did a backup and factory reset yesterday but on setting everything up again I realised that I had previously had all apps set to close on screen lock to save power. My theory is that if Pocket Informant hasn't synced before it gets closed, those new additions get deleted. So I've now got it set not to close and hoping that'll solve the problem.\nAnyone else encountered this kind of issue? \nIs this a likely solution? \nAm I missing anything?\nThanks in advance\nChris", "time": "04-25-2017 12:18 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5790588", "text": "Update - I posted this question to Honor support UK and received the following reply:\nTry enabling a few things to see if this helps resolve the issue...\n1) Please go into Settings \u00bb Wi-Fi \u00bb Advanced settings \u00bb Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep \u00bb Always\n2) Please go into Settings \u00bb More \u00bb Wireless & networks \u00bb Mobile Network \u00bb and enable Always-on mobile data\n3) Please go into Settings \u00bb Networked apps \u00bb and mark the desired apps that you want to work with both Wi-Fi and mobile data\n4) Please now go to Phone Manager app \u00bb (swipe left) Protected apps \u00bb and enable any apps that you want to keep running after the screen is turned off.\n5) Please, in the Phone Manage app, also select the Battery Manager and select the normal performance power plan (the smart power plan will disable Wi-Fi and other apps to conserve battery life.)\n6) Finally, when you make an appointment, you can close/lock the screen but do not actually close the app (you can close it later when you're sure that it has synced).\n7) If you think that your battery life or other circumstances are going to prevent your phone from syncing, you should be able to go into Settings \u00bb Accounts \u00bb Google account \u00bb and find an option to sync the account there.\nPlease let us know if the above helps to resolve the issue.

Verdict (Indian Version)", "thread": [{"postID": "post5499187", "text": "With the launch of the much awaited Honor 8 on October 12 in India, the battle among the top flagship smartphones has become even more exciting. While the market has got a new competitor to watch out for, here we open the debate to all by comparing top flagship phones from the current market leaders. Read on to know who takes the cake...\nBelow table shows the comparison of various technical specifications and pricing for the flagship phones.\nBased on the above table, we can clearly see the flagship phones from the top manufacturers around the world. They all boast of high-end specifications and are capable of doing much more than a smartphone is supposed to do. With the launch of Honor 8, the competition just got tougher and Honor 8 is really giving a neck to neck fight to all top guns here with almost half the price than that of iPhone 7 and 60% than that of Samsung S7. The only competitor we have in the price segment is one Plus 3 but Honor 8 definitely outshines OP3 with some quality specs and also from an end user's real life experience. It has a slim profile that redefines design. Icing on the cake is you get expandable storage and dual cameras.\nHonor 8 definitely has some additional factors over the other competitors here which makes it a clear winner:Dual camera with RGB and Monochrome sensors to give 300% more light than iPhone 7 in low light conditionAdvance Fingerprint supports NFC and Mobile payment along with additional features like taking photos, answering calls, stop alarms, shows recent app, access notification panel, scrolling through the photos in gallery, opening app etc.Expandable memory with SD card up to 128 GBThe built-in dual ISP improves focus, speed, and process time while clicking pictures.Wide aperture mode to redefine the focus even after photo is taken.The Eye-Care Mode makes looking at your phone more comfortable and safe by filtering part of the blue light to reduce eye strain.Smart Battery saving modesA-GPS+GLONASS *\n*this feature is present in all of the above listed flagship phone\nDesign- Honor 8 is stylish, sleek and it looks premium. It uses 2.5D glass in front and back making the device shiny. The Sapphire blue color that honor has launched is just stunning and breaks away from the regular greys and silver colors that most of the smartphones offer.Battery- There is no match to the battery life of Honor 8 with any other smartphone in the market even with a 4000 mAh battery. Honor 8 is able to stretch the screen on time (SOT) up to 7+ hours easily (even few users were able to touch 8 hours SOT) and that\u2019s the biggest advantage here over any other phone.Display- With 5.2 inch FHD IPS LCD display and 96% NTSC, every pixel reproduced on Honor 8 looks stunnning making it overall a great screen to view the content. With 423 PPI, everything displayed on the screen looks so natural and real. All the images, videos and other content looks so real and vibrant that you can't take your eyes off the display.Camera-The Honor 8 undoubtedly has the best camera even beating the likes of iPhone easily in its color reproduction and the details in the image. The Honor 8 is the only phone apart from Huawei P9 and the iPhone 7 Plus that offers a dual-camera setup in India and Honor 8 easily beats the camera quality of iPhone, even in low light condition. Hardware- OP3 comes with tested Qualcomm\u2019s SD820, iPhone with in house A9 chip, S7 with Exynos 8890 and are capable of lag free multitasking, Honor 8 is matches up to their standard being powered by hi-Silicon Kirin 950 processor-- built on 16 nm technology; i5 co-processor coupled with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM is capable enough to do multitasking smoothly. Rapid smart file processing system ensures lag free user experience. This phone wont slow down with time unlike other Android devices.UI/OS- OnePlus 3 offers a near stock Android experience with OxygenOS, Samsung comes with TouchWiz UI over android, iPhone7 offers iOS whereas the Honor 8 comes with a very intuitive Emotion UI 4.1 over Android Marshmallow. EMUI is feature-rich and provides lot of other options over other UIs and have built in phone manager, harassment filters, traffic manager and various innovative messaging features that really outsmart other UI and their features.[Verdict] Who Takes The Cake-\nBased on various specifications related to hardware, software, battery, design, look and feel, performance, camera and reliability and keeping in mind the price for the large number of users in Indian market, the Honor 8 is an excellent high-end flagship smartphone. For the power users who do not wish to compromise on the performance, look and other aspects of the phone this device is premium yet priced reasonably. Battery life is good, the dual camera produces superior professional quality shots, the fingerprint scanner is excellent and works almost every time and with 32GB of storage and a microSD card slot, there\u2019s plenty of space for apps, photos and music. I give a thumbs up to Honor 8 among the top four flagship phones.\nLink to my original post on Honor Community", "time": "10-17-2016 08:38 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5499405", "text": "Have you used all three phones?

You can even take a test from Google to build the right homescreen with recommended links to icon packs, wallpapers and custom launchers.\nNot only apps, but phone manufacturers also pack some great customization options in their modified version of android. Before diving into what apps and icon packs to download, it is worthwhile to dive into your phone\u2019s customization settings to make it your own. While those settings may not provide you with great wallpapers and icon packs, they can give you just the things you need to customize the hardware and software options.\nIn this post, lets take a look at some of the best personalization options available in the Honor 8 smartphone. Honor 8 offers great performance and personalization options in a small yet powerful package. It runs Android 7.0 packed with Huawei\u2019s own Kirin 950 processor, 4GB RAM and dual lens 12 MP rear camera. Honor\u2019s android version is called Emotion UI (EMUI) and has tons of options to customize your device.Note: Huawei and Honor share EMUI and you may notice EMUI options and apps sometimes prefixed with either Huawei or Honor. While there shouldn't be any problems, such apps should work in Honor and Huawei phones but it is always good to check the reviews before you install it.Fingerprint scanner\nFingerprint scanner is probably the most accessed item in your phone. We use it for several things\u200a\u2014\u200aunlock phones and authenticate for purchases. Honor goes one step further by providing custom button options on the fingerprint scanner. Honor calls it Smart key. Your fingerprint scanner now acts as a button and you can set actions for single press, double press and long press.\nI quite enjoy this setup and find it very handy to open my favorite app or launch the camera quickly. You can also setup to show notification panel when you slide down on the scanner.\nYou can access the smart key options in: Settings->Smart assistance->Smart key\nDon\u2019t forget to also look into the fingerprint options to find out more options: Settings->Fingerprint IDKnuckle gestures\nGestures are one of the smart ways to ease clutter in your home screen. Many launchers provide the ability to tie specific actions like opening an app or launching camera to specific gestures.\nHonor provides knuckle gestures which as it name goes, you use your knuckle to do the desired action. \nFor example:\n- I can tap twice using my knuckle to take a screenshot\n- I can use two knuckles to quickly start screen recording\n- I can draw (specific, but limited) letters to open specific apps\nI use these gestures everyday and enjoy every moment of it! Here is an example of me using the knuckle gesture to open calculator app by drawing the letter C.\nYou can access the knuckle gestures options in: Settings->Smart assistance->Motion control->Knuckle gesturesMagazine unlock\nLets get it out, lockscreens are boring. You see the same wallpaper every day and there is nothing you can feel happy about it other than getting notifications from your loved ones.\nWell, with the magazine unlock option you can now configure and subscribe to dynamic wallpaper collections so that a new wallpaper is set for the lockscreen every time you turn on your phone.*\nThe wallpapers are beautiful coming from the Leica photography collection. You will start loving your lockscreen as you see a beautiful image when you turn on your phone.\nBelow are some screenshots of my honor 8 lockscreen:\nYou can access the magazine unlock options in: Settings->Screen lock and passwords->Lock screen->Magazine unlock\nMake sure you have set your screen lock style as Magazine unlock.Themes\nWhile there is no official app to download and set themes for Honor 8, there are plenty of themes and apps available in the Play Store to theme your Honor 8. One such app is Huawei Theme Manager which allows you to download themes for your Honor 8. Final thoughts\nIts quite amazing how these simple options make using your phone easier. They make your mundane daily tasks easily accessible. \nThanks to Android, phone manufacturers are able to provide such options for their users.", "time": "04-04-2017 08:38 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5745720", "text": "Wow!

The 8 is plenty of performance for all of us at the \"price\" we paid. Key word guys. Remember that. In that article interview with the CEO of Honor he states clearly Honor will offer value prices. So if a small improvement to the Honor 8 doesn't hike the price $125 then that's great but I seriously fear eventually Honor will slowly have reoccurring price hikes like all large competitive companies do. Let's hope I'm wrong but history seems to always rewrite itself and if honor again like I've said many times stays true to their core roots which the CEO said it himself a great device at a much lesser cost then I'm definitely in for a Honor 9. Oh and yes two screen sizes would be great. I picked up the Axon Pro which is at the end of its life for $279 and it's a heck of a device for its flagship specs simply bc I wanted a second device with a larger screen but with premium specs. Hopefully Honor will deliver but then again to cut costs they still may offer only one variant of the honor 9 which I think will end up being 5.4 or 5.5 and that's all we will get but at the much lesser price like the Honor 8. I strongly believe honor has a team reading these forums and let's all hope they have listened to all of us bc in the end we all are the ones who make them or can break them.

I could see them doing the bait and hook deal at least the first month then either it will remain at that higher price or then go on sale to remain at the sale price.

I don't mean that rude, rather I'm seriously asking if it's justified by being almost $300 more dollars. If the screen size is the major difference than no justification but if the phone just flat out performs the Honor 8 then it's of course justified. I'm trying to debate with myself whether if it's a good idea or avenue for Huawei Honor who is branded as one company produce like two totally separate companies. I'm speaking exclusively of the Honor 8 which I own and use daily. Performance wise it's every bit as good as all the other flagships I've tested and I have tested just about all of them except HTC. That being said they avoid competing with themselves by Huawei producing higher price phones, however if Honor like the Honor 8 is close to or very near equal to the Mate 9 in overall performance and specs other than screen size then why is this approach they're taking worth it to them. Maybe it's selling more quantity and offering a variety at everyone's different budget. Lastly though I do commend both Huawei and Honor for producing two incredible devices that are on par with each other with one being almost $300 less dollars if that makes sense. I truly believe with all that said that overall Huawei Honor is in a very good position if they stay on their current course to become one of the top mobile companies here in the US too. By the way I'm dying to get the Mate 9 but knowing my Honor 8 performance wise is all I need, I'm having trouble justifying spending $600 on the mate 9. I do want that larger screen for my second phone but then I'm also wanting to wait and see what the future holds for the Honor 9 too. I still refer back to that thread with that had the interview with the CEO of Honor stating their core value is producing a top end device at a budget price. In the grand scheme of it all most flagship if not all are really overpriced if Honor can produce a phone such as the Honor 8 that runs from $300 to $375 depending the gig compared to the likes of google, Motorola, samsung, LG, HTC, and who ever else I'm leaving out. We as a market are overpaying if the proof is in the Honor 8 which in terms of real world performance as someone like myself who's tested most of the above said devices and I ( being part of the general market) use an Honor 8 over or as opposed to all those others at double the price. Either Honor is flat out a good deal with that part of their company not having a very high profit margin or the other hand we are grossly overpaying as whole for these others at $600 all the way up to $1050 around or so for almost an equal phone to that of the Honor 8. Do you guys see what I'm getting at here? Which is it? Honor giving away their product or are we overpaying for a product??

Battery helps too for sure but let's face it other than performance, these are two totally different phones that targets two totally different buyers in terms of overall marketability. So the segment of the market for a 5.9 in screen, market value may suggest or demand this price point where as a 5.2 inch smaller phone my demand or reflect marketability of much cheaper which I believe plays a pretty large factor here. I know there is no $180 nor $250 marketability supported difference in performance between the two so it's a apple compared to an orange and one side of the market expects the apple to run around price A. The other, the orange, the market who prefers to eat it over the apple expects to pay a price around price B. That right there is the only way to support the price difference bc performance isnt really a factor that is different enough to really come into play. On paper there isn't $250 dollars worth of difference but in the real world market expectations, there is. Has nothing to do with supply and demand either. Just pure marketability no different than what I do every day for living which is appraise residential homes based up on one of the factors of its marketability. Typically larger demands a higher price than smaller in just about all tangible items. So there you have it. This is the exact reason there is a rough average of $180 to $250 price difference which is totally market driven. One other factor here that doesn't come into play yet is brand name demand. Majority of mobile phone users could not tell you one thing about Huawei or Honor like they could Samsung and Motorola.

So, here are my quick thoughts on Honor 8 after the nougat update.\n- Fingerprint scanner is faster. I notice before the update, there would be a split second delay with the scanner. It was accurate, but little slow. Now, there is no delay. It's almost OnePlus 3 fast, which to me is the fastest fingerprint scanner I've experience to date.\n- Camera is also faster. Again, this was another area which was annoying. The picture quality was fine, but I always thought the shutter speed was slow. Again, a split second delay. But after nougat, shutter speed feels more acceptable. Not S7 Edge or OnePlus fast, but much better than before. \n- Before the update, I was using Nova Launcher, because I really needed the app drawer. I can't stand having all the apps on the home page and then have to create folders to organize them. This is more of a personal preference, but now that the app drawer is an option, I have not needed to use Nova. \n- Battery life has not been as good. But I'm wondering if it's because of Google Assistant. I just turned that off, so we'll see if the battery life improves. On 4.1, I had about 3 hours of SOT with about 30-35% still left when I went to bed. Now, I'm down to 10-15% with similar SOT and usage. So, I'm really hoping turning off Google Assistant makes a difference.\n- To be honest, I'm not a big fan of stock android. I enjoy the various skins OEM puts on their phones. Some do it well and others don't, but for most part, I enjoy the features they add to android. But I am definitely not a fan of iOS. I thought 4.1 was little too much iOS, but the overall package of the phone was great enough for me to overlook that. With 5.0, it feels more android. \n- I'm also getting that weird audio error message, but it doesn't seem to affect the actual recording of the video. Just annoying that it shows up.\nOverall, I thought this was a great upgrade. For me Honor 8 now feels like a complete package.

The return to the normal android task switcher is a plus and android 7.0 features such as double tapping the recents menu to switch to the last app you used is super handy and one that i use almost every day.\nThe layout of the settings app is much better than before. Under EMUI 4.1, the battery/power settings were buried under the advanced settings. In addition, under EMUI 4.1 if you plugged in your phone at night, when the alarm went off in the morning, the dismiss/snooze control wouldn't appear on the lock screen because of a notification that your phone is plugged in and charging. That annoying behavior does not appear in EMUI 5.0.\nI don't know why Huawei/Honor felt like they had to change the share menu from the stock share menu but it is at least visually appealing.\nAgain, I agree that it is a great update.", "time": "03-19-2017 09:03 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5719245", "text": "I'm on 4.1, plug my phone in when I go to bed.

I believe a battery takes a while to settle in and find its typical normalcy mark (after heavy regular based usage) and two, like one of the posters said, App consumption. Even if I think I've shut all my power consuming Apps down, they end up reopening and remain to run in the background which pulls from battery life. That said, the honor 8 I'd still consider to be above average even though it doesn't appear to as good as it once was. Overall with most of us using our phones daily heavy usage we all still get a decent and above average battery life I think. I just know I'm charging my honor 8 much more often than I used to have to. I used to get my best battery performance when I hovered between 75 percent to 85 percent but now it even drains from my old optimal level. It's two fold. One being us the user and two, being the phone and how it is consuming the battery life. The only sure fire way to fix it is wipe the phone factory fresh and load the bare minimum of apps and you'll see a much better overall battery life but then where is the fun in that limiting oneself of apps that you typically keep on your phone whether they see daily use or not.

That just really bums me out bc 4.1 to me honestly was I'm a league of it own. It was almost like we finally had a third player in the mix. IOS, Android and then EMUI being the third player to hit the scene. They need to read these forums bc 4.1 was good enough that I believe other companies would have tried to gear their software interface to match EMUI 4.1. I still have 4.1 and now I'm convinced I won't get 5.0 until 2018 lol but 4.1s interface is awesome. Refreshing bc it's not the in your face IOS not is it the block letters pure Android. They were very creative and it brought about innovation which blended both software interfaces into one to create an entire new player to the mobile software world. OP is it real bad or subtle? You stated that it's a lot like pure Android. Does it still have its own personality or have they caved to the Android purists and lost their minds and left their innovation behind with 5.0? Like I said I have yet to get 5.0 so if you could share more examples that would be great as I would actually consider not upgrading for at least a while until I had to if it's truly not Honors own software now. I have grown to like EMUI 4.1 better than IOS and Pure Android 10 times over. It's why I still have my Honor 8 bc my typical style is to buy a new one and test it out and then sell it and buy a different one and do it again so I never kept a phone long at all but I kept my honor 8 bc it's the best interface on the market as far as a perfect mixture of the two to be a hybrid. I love it. Man I didn't want to hear that about 5.0 and that gets me back to Honor and them sticking to their core roots. Why change something that is so refreshing and perfectly refined yet totally different enough to actually be considered a third contender in a world of only two software to choose from. Ouch!! I guess I'll find out soon enough when my update hits but 4.1 to me personally I would choose in a heartbeat over stock Android or IOS. There is really no learning curve either to it. It's just that honor created an entire new mobile software interface and I guess people dislike change that they hated on it so now honor caved in to that. Once I used 4.1 for two straight weeks I was totally sold on it. Best software experience going right now. If you will please share as much as you can about your statement that it's more like pure Android now.

What people are missing here is that EMUI basically wasn't Android at all. In fact their intent was just that or else it would have been like Android. What's wrong with Android, IOS and EMUI? I've never been sold on pure Android to be honest. The post I said I endorsed was very well written. EMUI introduce a new breed of mobile software experience. I really don't get why there was so much resistance towards that. Different doesn't mean bad or inferior rather it means exactly what it says, different. I believe Honor had this direct intent in mind too when they created it. The masses resisted the newly different introduced software enough to make Honor become a true Android now it sounds. Even though they were placed in the Android category was because at the time that was the only choice they had. Honor just made a mistake in a huge way because eventually they would have been placed in the EMUI category which I'm thinking what is wrong with having three totally different software to choose from. Wow this is bad news indeed. The Honor 8 was never an Android at all and was built with the intent not to be either. I guess they were forced to become another Android product but I was totally unaware of the rule that there could only be two software choices and that's it. It'll be back to the drawing board for me as I'll start testing other devices if this is indeed what has happened. That's all we get I guess either Android or IOS. Having a third choice I see nothing wrong with but I guess honor felt like I'd they wanted to continue to grow and sells to keep trending upwards than the masses forced their hand on this total change of direction.", "time": "02-15-2017 01:29 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5678739", "text": "5 is just a more streamlined EMUI.\nTurning off notifications for the power consuming apps is a must.

For some reason my 32g although I don't download movies or songs, I have plenty of room still available but mentally it drives me insane knowing I could get the 64g. I had a iPhone 6s 128g and seriously on that phone due to my line of work, I had over 4000 pics on it and it barely touched that 128g. I think I'm going to order the 64g in Pearl color and just have two Honor 8 phones or do you guys think I should just sell my Nexus 6p when I order the 64g Honor? I can tell you I prefer the Honor 8 size much more but my 6p has been nice to browse the net and watch movies with its 5.7 inch screen and awesome resolution. Like right now I have both phones with me but I'm in my Honor as I type this. My 6p hardly sees any use anymore and I even just got 7.1.1 update on my 6p. Honestly I can't see that much of an interface difference between 7.0 and 7.1.1. The Honor 8 truly rocks!\nTo the ones who said it's a hobby and go for it, I respect that bc that is just how I am. I used to be that way with high end automatic Swiss Diver watches. At one time I had about 60k worth of high end watches at one time. You taking about insanity. I was in my early 30s to mid and one day I woke up and said I need to get a hold of myself so I sold off my collection and now I only keep one to two high end automatic watches. I was a big time member of several high end watch forums. Heck if you were to google DCJ Breitling watches or DCJ Omega watches or even DCJ photos you'd see hundreds of pics of all my watches and sports cars ive been through. I was crazy with it. Now I'm in to tech so I've been through a ton of phones since making the move over to Android. One of my favs is Motorola. I had the Moto Z Force with just about every Mod and that was a great device. Ironically the 6p is basically identical to the Z Force except for the obvious Moto mods. I have since left Verizon though as they messed up my bill and didn't own up to it so I went to Cricket. \nHere's another choice I have. Amazon currently has the Moto Z on sale for $499 regular price $699. It's the one that's advertised as the slimmest phone made. It has the 820 processor and sky high resolution. I could go for it and get back into the moto mods and it would replace my 6p as it's 5.5 inches. \nSo what do you guys think. 64g Pearl Honor 8 or the flagship Moto Z with a couple of Moto mods which one being the battery mod and the other being the JBL speaker Mod. I thoroughly enjoyed my Z Force and loved the Mods. I'm leaning towards the Moto Z and just selling my 6p as it's basically still brand new. As a collector I keep all my boxes and interior components left in plastic along with the box having matching serial numbers as that tends to retain value better. I keep all my original boxes and papers due to my long time watch collecting. \nSo here it is... Moto Z unlocked for $499 regular price $699 or Honor 8 64g on sale on Amazon but not nearly as low as it was on black Friday. Out of the two, which would you guys go for. I have no doubt I'm going for it so now it's which to go for. One other choice is the ZTE Axon 7 64g 5.5 inch screen with the highest screen resolution which is on sale for $354 right now. I have to stay with Amazon bc that is where I have my credit at. I considered the Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe but it seems not to have the support and reviews to back it's paper specs up.

He clearly states that Honor is its own identity basically. Plus he referenced that Huawei would be the ones who would be picked up by major carriers. Although reading his statement and owning an Honor 8 vs all the other high end flagships ive tested leads me to still believe that we will see at least one or two Honor devices carried by the major carriers. I'm just not totally buying that they will solely rely on e-commerce or online sales only for revenue. Not when there is an open door to bring them more customers which is another statement he makes about targeting age groups and introducing Honor to more and more meaning growth. You can see the corrupt underlying contradiction here bc you can only grow so far with online sales only. They may have not reached their potential but they will and for a company to have continued growth means having more than one avenue for revenue.

If a company's goal is to grow and increase sales or revenue then it's actually not even remotely logical to believe that Honor will only rely on e-commerce or online sales solely. They aren't making a flagship type device because they just love to. They do so like any company no matter the product. Money and growth is every company's goal. From small ones to large ones. Growth equals more revenue. I do not believe they are going to totally ignore other avenues that they either have available now or will very soon. Just like all of us aren't working every day bc we love or bc it gives us good health. It's because we need money and because we strive to make more. It will be a huge surprise to me if what he stated is 100 percent true. Honor is in this to grow and do to so means using the most productive avenues to do so which isn't the internet only.

What I've found so far so interesting is how snappy and responsive the phone is. Opening apps is so blazing quick. I was really unsure with Huawei using their own software on Android if this would hinder the phone. It's quite the opposite. Somehow, they've managed to optimize the two combinations with success. The phone is a good hand size yet, the screen quality for reading articles, web pages etc is very good. Web video quality is amazing such as urine, sports videos etc.\nThe phone is light. It's nice to hold and easy to put in your pocket. The phone finish is Sexy. Though I do have a clear cover to protect. The back with its glass finish is slightly slippery so I go this cover thrown on with the deal.\nB&H photo right now you can pick this phone up for $289 with their coupon at checkout. Crazy deal.\nThe EMUI embedded software took with a few hours to get used to. Now I have no issues. The layout is different than that of stock Android. I've read and article this am that some people are using Google Launcher on their Honor 8 and P9 phones with great success. For me, I actually like their launcher. Something new to explore.\nAs for music, the quality through the speaker at the bottom of the phone like the plus 3 has good quality. I have not tried earphones yet.\nThe dual camera is a wow too. Better images I think that the plus 3.\nSetup was so easy. Loaded up by sim and memory card. Everything loaded up smoothly with no issues. It took me approximately 45 minutes from the time I took the phone out of the box, kept it charged with a complete setup. No too shabby I say.\nI'm really glad I bought this phone.

I've tried just about every high end phone out there. It was fun to test them but for a long time I was exclusive to Apple. IOS is rather just too much if that makes sense. Then pure stock Android isn't bad. I liked it but it seamed unrefined. So when I dove into the Honor 8 I immediately was like, wow this software interface is by far the best experience hands down on the mobile phone market. I truly believe why people say it's different is because it truly is but what Huawei Honor did which was a brilliant move was take IOS features and Android features and blended them so perfectly that this software becomes different. The layout is a breeze to learn. Getting used to a superior user experience since we all are so deeply used to either in your face IOS and to me like Block letters pure Android that this perfect blend will throw you off for a second bc it's just that well done. You get a class act software that is so seamless and truly without any major flaw and most people just really don't know how to explain it other than using different. I use the best or superior bc this is exactly what this interface is. Additionally it does not favor one software more than the other rather it's just a new breed of mobile software without the extremes of either and it's so refined it's an enjoyable experience to use daily. It's like they created a third type software which I would not be surprised if you see companies in the future shaping their interface to be highly comparable to Huawei honor as opposed to extreme Android and extreme IOS.

While unboxing and inserting my sim card I noticed that the tray was already a bit scratched up. I didn't want to be too picky about it, so I tried to look over it. A day later when I wanted to install a tempered glass I also noticed quite visible scratches on the left side of the screen. Because I had the phone for only one day and haven't used it a lot in that time, I really wondered. After inspecting that with a bright flashlight I saw that the scratches are UNDER the screen and there's even a tiny dust particle UNDER the screen. I'm not sure how that's possible, since the screen and digitizer should be one unit. But it's definitely underneath the glass. Little dust particles above the glass and perspective make that clear to me.\nI still don't want to be too picky and actually want to keep the phone, but these are already two quality issues on a brand new phone. So I'm not sure whether I should return this unit. Downside is that I got the device for a really reasonable price (270 \u20ac) and will probably lose a discount when I'm going to exchange (new price would be around 330 \u20ac). The scratches and dust particle under the glass aren't visible when the screen is turned on. What do you think about it?

I haven't read that article yet but my prediction is to give Huawei Honor two to three more years of strong US based presence and I personally think they will become the leader or surpass Samsung as the what you call Android household name. Their product speaks volumes for itself. If they can managed to stay true to their core roots which is the best device for the value there is no way possible they wouldn't overtake Samsung. I don't even compare them to Apple. Not bc apple is better but bc I'm speaking solely of android devices. I've never understood from day one why anyone would totally dislike EMUI 4.1. Not once have I ever thought about using my paid version of Nova over this interface. However what I just said, the total opposite could happen if they ignore their roots and economics. They've already proven you can make an equal to device to every current flagship at a great value. If they increase their pricing bc they feel like they need to compete with Samsung or Google that way instead of letting their product compete, they will fail miserably. I'm not saying a small increase will hurt but to price themselves right out of the customer market base who put them in this perfect position to be the top two or three household names would be sheer greed which sadly most companies always fall victim to from that evil mighty dollar. I've seen it happen in the high end Swiss Automatic watch industry and so it will happen to Huawei Honor if they don't stay their course. Right now if they stay true I give it two years, they are at the top here. Increase pricing to that of Samsung and Google they will do no better than HTC or LG and be considered good not the best. The ball lies heavily in their court bc they've got the product to back it up. Big head they don't crack the top 5, stay true to the course they have set thus far, the absolute household name go to Android device here in the US. I have no idea what that article says and I'll read it later but I wanted to give my thoughts without any bias from a authority trend type article rather I say what I think based on my user experience with their product which now all three of my devices are Huawei Honor. Honor 8, Media Pad 3 (by the way is so on even par with the iPad pro and heads and shoulders better than any Android tablet to date) and the Honor 5X that I was honored to win here. :-). I hope to be using a Mate 9 very soon too. Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback to my prediction. I truly believe it will all happen this way depending what economic path this company takes.

I too was guilty for a long time always being with a carrier. When mobile tech started to become a passion is when I left the carrier world so I could constantly start trying out different devices by way of unlocked phones. I deeply enjoy testing out new devices and experiencing different software and interfaces. The only way for my prediction of Huawei Honor to have a chance to come through largely rides on the top or major carriers to pick them up which equals immediate growth bc majority of people who use a mobile phone are indeed with a carrier so I'm quite sure Huawei Honors goal here is to be picked up by the top US carriers as that then opens up the majority of the market to use or test out their devices which I believe will lead them to eventually surpass Samsung or become in the top two household Android names and of course too if they stay on course with a proven track record of producing a high end flag ship device to be at least 30 percent less in price compared to their biggest competitors which will most likely be google and Samsung. If they did one second raise their prices to that of both of those others then no way they get to the top. I see nothing wrong with taking advantage of a nitch within the market which they've proven already with the Honor 8 can be done. Samsung if they produced the same device as the honor 8, they would charge $600 to $699 and what Huawei Honor has shown is that the market is grossly inflated by big heads forgetting about their customers and solely competing with each other just to say they have the best device. I see nothing wrong with Huawei Honor staying their course to easily compete with those two but saving the customer 25 to 30 percent of their money because Huawei Honors product once in enough hands will easily prove and show that their device is equal to but at a much more affordable price. Unfortunately the realist in me sees Huawei Honor getting caught up in the big head competing factor and they will eventually cave and raise their prices so they can have bragging rights to officially compete. I use my Honor 8 every day and it's every bit equal to my iPhone 6s i had or my Moto Z Force I had but at almost a 35 to 40 percent price savings. Money always ruins a good thing. Anyways carriers are here to stay and Google and Samsung are going to keep grossly overpricing their product and the typical consumer will continued to grossly overpay unless Huawei Honor steps in and capitalizes on that very note and shows that typical consumer that he or she can actually get the same high end spec device $250 dollars cheaper and actually save money. I doubt Huawei Honor will ever take that path but long term if they did, they would be at the top outselling both of those others by double quantity therefore enforcing their long term stability and continued growth rather than making a lot of money for a little while then to eventually drop so far back down that they would probably just give up long term on the US market all together. Hoping they will stick to their core values bc if they do they definitely will be one of the top two or three in two to three years.", "time": "02-02-2017 03:33 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "I cannot not use my honor 8.", "thread": [{"postID": "post5636274", "text": "I have 2 other phones that I use to switch between all the time.

I know you weren't asking me specifically, but I'll lend my two cents. \nI would find it a little bit difficult to truly compare the two, as the iPhone 7 Plus is a flagship device and the Honor 8 is a midrange device; however, the Honor 8 does have a lot of the similar specs of last year's average flagship at a great price. It is also somewhat similar in aesthetic to the iPhone line, in my opinion, but (also in my opinion), the Honor 8 looks better (also, I'm more of an Android fan). \nAlso, if you're going to compare the two devices, if things like camera, video taping, etc are important to you, then the quality of photos/videos on the Honor 8 - though they're quite good - will not be on par with that of the iPhone 7 Plus.\nThe Honor and iPhone do have some similar OS components - like no app drawer, for example, and apparently their lock screen operations are similar? Again, I don't have any concrete experience with Apple, this is just what I've read and heard around the forums or with other users - but Honor does have a different operating system called EMUI, which has received mixed reviews.\nIf you're trying to save money and are interested in a unique and also budget-saving experience, I highly recommend the Honor 8. However, if you're really into Apple, are familiar with the OS, and enjoy the media aspect of the device, I would recommend Apple.", "time": "12-19-2016 08:50 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5613464", "text": "He's the perfect person to ask.

Then there is the font size adjustment within a text by pinching or pull apart your fingers. Smaller or larger. I absolutely don't understand why I've read so many who dislike this software interface experience. It's not much of a learning curve and I personally think it's refined to a better experience than pure stock Android. Anyone else feel that way too? I'm about to place an order for a Moto Z Play as my second phone but I'm still highly considering ordering the Pearl Honor 8 in a 64g instead. I just wish they offered the honor 8 in two versions. 5.2 and a 5.5 or 5.7. I like for my second phone to be larger than my daily go to phone which is my black Honor 8. I'm not sure how EMUI 5.0 is as I haven't found anywhere that will allow me to download the beta version but if they have made it way more pure Android then I'm definitely staying on 4.1.

A tip or trick is first aligne the top hole cut outs at the top but don't press it down year. Gently lay the screen to rest on the surface of the device. From there with the tips of your fingernails slightly move to the perfect alignment. Just be sure you don't press at all bc once it starts to adhere then you won't be able to push anymore to get the perfect position. Once you are happy with your alignment, take a cloth starting from the bottom and start a normal wipe across back and forth as you move up the screen. If you have zero particles under the glass, it will adhere without any air pockets that particles cause. Even the smallest particle will cause an air bubble. I normally wipe my screen down with a solution and then dry it by whipping. Once you have the screen totally 100 percent free of Lent or particles, then at that point peel off your bottom layer of the glass protector. Have the phone turned sideways as this helps with the initial perfect hole alignment at the top. If you end up with naturally a bubble or air pocket either push it to the sides or tops or gently re-lift the protector until you get to the air pocket then release and proceed to wipe across and upward from there again. This may sound like a lot but once you start it takes less than a minute to install. The MAIN objective is to use good lighting bc I'm telling ya even the slightest lent or particle under the screen will show and myself personally, there is nothing worse than seeing something under the protector. That's why you peel the layer off last right before the install bc you run about a 95 percent rate of nothing jumping on the glass back layer to drive you insane. I install all of my own bc if you allow someone else to do it they will not care as much as you do. Attention to detail is a must die to alignment. Too much to one side can cause a halo also. It's really easy but I wanted to write this in detail to ensure you install perfect on your first attempt. Have some scocth tap near buy in case you do have a particle that gets trapped under as you can halfway lift it back up and slide the tape to the particle and snag it then lay it back down to finish up.

When I say a lot like seriously over 10 devices. Some having had twice. Those were Samsung that I owned twice trying to force myself to like their software which is the worst on the high end market. The Honor 8 is easily equal to the iPhone 6s which used to be my favorite phone. I bought my Honor 8 for $349 and I should have waited and got it for $299 or went with the 64g. That being said and saying that it's equal to the 6s which is what $700 plus with 128g like I had, I'd rate this honor 8 an easy 8 plus or it may even pull in a 9 just barely. I have enjoyed Honor's software interface as it's a hybrid of Android and IOS which give the interface a smooth and seamless interaction. Performance is plenty good on this device and screen resolution is good too. I've not found one deal breaker on the Honor 8 and that's saying a lot going through as many phones as I have since leaving Apple last year. I can tell you I prefer the Honor over my Nexus 6p which is why the Honor is my main go to phone. I have two numbers so I keep two phones. At the moment I'm looking to replace my 6p with something else as I enjoy trying different devices. The Honor 8 is a keeper and it's refreshing and a nice change from typical Android and typical IOS. The 5.2 screen size can be debated but personally as a daily phone I wouldn't want anything any larger. I think they kept it 5.2 knowing that this size is as big as you can go if the device is to be practical for a daily driver. I know my 6p is hard to lug around and keep in my pocket. Personally my favorite size is 5.0 inches but the Honor 8 feels a lot like a 5.0 phone for some reason. For me to totally leave apple and to say this device is every bit as equal to the iPhone 6s is saying a lot from my point of view personally. I'm still a huge apple fan. No conpany makes a better tablet experience than apple hands down. Android phones that I think are great would be the Honor, Motorola and the Google line since Moto and Google keep it mostly pure Android. Samsung touch wiz is the worst choppy and sticky OK interface of all Android high ends. Anyways the honor 8 gets a 8 plus or a close 9 here for my vote. A big part of my vote was due to the software interface. There is simply nothibg on the market like EMUI and I'm one to promote different and unique. Honor 8 didn't follow a trend and made their software by using innovation and when I see or find that, I'm immediately a huge supporter. Being different and unique is who I am as long as it's done with taste and a lot of thought behind.

I knew I'd lose some features like water resistance, camera and maybe performance but was happy to make the change for a phone which worked properly. \nI spend ages deciding on what phone I should get, more than is necessary really. It finally came down to the Oneplus 3 and Honor 8.\nIn the end I dismissed the op3 due to reports of poor signal reception and no expandable storage. I work in the countryside which weak signal, so decent signal reception abilities and expandable storage are a must (I've got 40+ gb of audio!). Also oneplus have a reputation of all but abandoning their older phones (though the op3 maybe different). I've seen what Huawei have done with emui 5 and while they're not necessarily the fastest they do seem to support a lot of their devices quite well! \nSo we took the plunge and bought one yesterday. After the initial buyers remorse (I always get this, it's a phone for goodness sake!) I'm very impressed with what you get for the money. The screen is bright enough for me, has punchy colours (which I like), blacks are quite inky for a lcd and full HD is plenty sharp for me. I prefer amoled but this has its advantages (not worried about dark themes or the chance of burn in now, even if that isn't likely in this day and age). The s7 is a better display, but to massively to my eyes. I'm very happy with this. \nPerformance has been great, I can't see the need to spend top dollar to get silky smooth performance anymore. It feels just as quick as the s7 (exynos version) in day to day use. I was worried about the graphics (kirin processors' weak spot historically) but I realised I don't play hugely demanding games and so far it's not skipped a beat. \nBattery is so far is great. Obviously it's to early to tell, with setting the phone up and downloading and updating everything but the battery percentage seems to take longer to go down.\nIm actually fine with emui on the whole. The only two things I don't is no app draw and the icon appearance for some apps. So I've loaded nova launcher for now but applied for the emui 5 beta as that seems to sort the issues! \nBuild quality is really nice. I would prefer a metal design but I use a case so doesn't make too much difference. I do think a case is essential though. The phone is slippery, in hand I don't have too much problem, but this phone slides of everything. I've put it on what I considered pretty flat surfaces and watched as it slowly tried to escape. I swear gravity has a stronger pull on it! I love the fingerprint scanner but keep pressing it (so used to the s7) and turning the torch on, but I'll learn! \nI'm enjoying the ir blaster, not had the opportunity to use the camera much so can't judge that yet. \nAll in all, I got far more than I would for the money. I'm converted, no more 'flagships' for me I think.

Positively the a quality of build is very high end and detailed. The Honor is my main phone these days. I've also got a nexus 6p but I'm on the verge of ordering the ZTE Axon 7. I like to keep two phones, one smaller and one larger. The Honor 8 will be considered my smaller phone for a while to come and I'm close to pulling the trigger on the ZTE. It's a 5.5 vs my 6p 5.7 but 5.5 is still large. Negative on the Honor 8 is that without a back skin or case, the device is like holding a piece of butter. The device is just that slippery but I installed a carbon fiber back skin from skinomi so when I'm not using my case it now has a textured grip.

I think it's definitely a hybrid of both smartphone worlds which is cool to me. I've enjoyed using the Honor software. Normally I download my Nova to use but on the Honor 8 I've not even considered it. I enjoy things that are unique and different which is prob why I am so pro EMUI. I like the pure Android on my 6p and I liked it on my Moto Z Force too. The Honor software interface is a nice change from the typical so I welcome the different which also to me is a form of innovation. If the iPhone 8 is going to be full of new and different features then, I'll get one of those too as apple was the only software I knew before a year ago. I miss my Apple devices at times but in the end both softwares have their strong points and I feel like Honor took both the softwares and built a hybrid giving the user some of both worlds.

During this time period, I used the Honor 8 with an official Huawei clear case and a tempered glass screen protector.\nHonor 8 specs:\nHonor 8\n32GB ROM\n4GB RAM\n12 MP Dual Cameras back\n8 MP front-facing camera\nDual-tone flash\nKirin 950 processor (octa-core)\nBluetooth 4.1\nUSB-C 1.0\n1080p IPS LCD display\nFlagships are obscenely overpriced - and usually, that didn\u2019t matter to the person who wanted top-level specs. But new midrangers like the Honor 8, OnePlus 3, ZTE Azon 7, and the Alcatel Idol 4S show that 2016 has truly been the year of midrangers, and the Honor 8 is no exception. With modular tech still needing development, huge explosion scandals, and update headaches aplenty, the Honor 8 seems like a refreshing choice. is it right for you? Let\u2019s find out!I. First Impressions\nThe Honor 8 is made of a smooth glass (2.5D glass that wraps around the sides), with a metal band around the sides. The back glass is apparently \u201c15-layer\u201d (marketing buzzword alert), but it looks very cool. I usually put Otterbox or some variant of tough case on my phones, but the Honor 8 was the only phone which I could not bear to case over (I did, however, opt for a clear case). While the famed \u201crefraction effect\u201d of light on the back glass wasn\u2019t as dramatic as some made it out to be, it\u2019s still an impressive piece of art.\nThe fingerprint sensor on the Honor 8 is truly unique (but not for much longer *cough* Pixel *cough*). It's very quick, and easy to use. The one drawback to having the sensor on the back is that it's difficult to unlock your phone quickly when it's lying face up on a table.\nIt feels a bit hypocritical to say this, but fingerprint scanners make phones less secure. Not only can fake fingerprints be generated, but your fingerprint can be lifted from the phone itself. Also, if you live in the United States, the police are allowed to force you to unlock your phone with your finger, but not a password (the reasoning behind this being that extracting information from your mind like a PIN is self-incrimination, but a fingerprint is a physical part of you, not information). I say this feels hypocritical because I always look for a fingerprint sensor in a phone - it just seems so much more convenient.\nWith such a quick unlock time, what more could there be to a fingerprint sensor? Well, it turns out a lot! Acting as a button, the sensor can also perform action such as launching apps or turning on the flashlight with a single, double, or long press down.\nCalling on the Honor 8 has been...an experience. While I can hear the caller on the other end of the line perfectly (ruling out connection issues), I often had issues with sound quality and garbled noises, and I had to repeat myself many times for the other caller to hear me properly. The issue is compounded when in speakerphone mode - I think the microphones aren't well adjusted for distances like putting the phone on a desk and calling. \nVoice dialing and commands, for both the Huawei voice command assistant and the Google Now assistant were, however, perfect, and even worked across the room. When recording audio in a video or with the built-in audio recording app, sound quality was crisp, but not as loud as I would have liked - voices seemed muted and quiet.\nII. The part you touch, but don't actually touch\nThe display on the Honor 8 is very nice - while it doesn't quite match up to the AMOLED display on the OnePlus 3, blacks are very dark and colors are vibrant, if a bit off in terms of color accuracy. The screen size is adequate for most videos and games, although I found the wider screens on phones like the Honor 5X to be more comfortable for gaming (although less portable). Streaming Netflix at 1080p, I could see the finer details in dark scenes on Arrow very well. Photos taken with the camera (more on that later) looked great, but the colors just seemed...off. I think color accuracy is one of the weaker points of the Honor 8, so if you're looking for a phone that has colors true to life, you'd be better off with a phone like the OnePlus 3.\nThe light sensor works, but I found the auto brightness to be a bit overzealous - the backlight seemed too dim most of the time, and I found myself manually adjusting the brightness more than I would've liked.\nThe vibration motor on the Honor 8 is extremely weak - I got about half the level of haptic feedback as I did from my Honor 5X, which is half the cost of the Honor 8.\nThe proximity sensor is good, but I feel like it could be put to better use with a feature like raise to wake or pocket wake.\nThe stock Huawei launcher is garbage. There's just no way around it. There's no app drawer, and it's filled with gimmicks and clutter. Now that live calendar icons (where the date changes on the icon for the calendar app) are compatible with third-party launchers like Nova Launcher, there's really no reason to use the stock launcher on any phone.\nI find screen rotation to be slow on most devices, and the Honor 8 is no exception. Sometimes failing to respond to screen rotations, the Honor 8 sits squarely with almost every other device I have tested, so relatively, it is fine.\nTouches registered perfectly on the screen, and it can handle up to 10 individual touches (according to AnTuTu).\nHuawei\u2019s stock apps just scream inexperienced with western markets. They're clunky, hard to use, and look terrible. I disabled as many as I could (one), and found Google alternatives for others. I highly recommend you do the same.\nEMUI on the Honor 8 was actually quite bearable, and once I applied Nova Launcher, I found it to actually be quite nice-looking (but with some odd quirks, like black text on the dark notification panel not showing up well for Outlook notifications).\nBrowsing speeds were good, but not great. While websites rendered well and smoothly, I found the experience to be just below what I would expect from a $400 phone.\nStreaming video took a long time to initially load, even on a Gigabit internet connection, but after the initial loading, there wasn't too much buffering.\nGames, however, are a different matter. The graphics card on the Honor 8 is squarely midrange - and it shows. Real Racing 3 took 3 minutes to load, and often crashed or froze. Other games like Subway Surfers worked well, but seemed to fare badly with multitasking.III. Keyboard\nGoogle Keyboard worked perfectly for me on the Honor 8, and although it seemed a little cramped, it was perfect for one-handed use.\nIV. Battery\nThe battery in the Honor 8 lasts me an entire school day - something most phones struggle to do, due to my multitude of background processes I enjoy having on my phone. While I had to fiddle with the power settings to squeeze the last bit of performance out of the processor (at the expense of the battery life), I found the battery to be sufficient for most days. On days with lots of streaming and camera usage, I found myself needing my KMASHI 10000mah portable battery back, from which the Honor 8 charged quickly. The included Huawei Quick Charger is nice, but the proprietary tech isn't compatible with standards like Qualcomm QuickCharge (probably because there isn't a Qualcomm chip in the Honor 8), and buying another Huawei Quick Charger is a bit of a hassle, as it isn't sold on HiHonor.com, leaving you to trust an Amazon dealer (not that Amazon dealers are generally untrustable, but I prefer to buy from OEMs). USB-C is a welcome addition, although I would have found it hugely convenient if Honor had included a USB-C to MicroUSB adapter, so I could interface with the hundreds of microUSB cables I currently own.\nThe built-in Ulta power saving mode isn't as zealous or well implemented as the Samsung ultra power saving mode, but is still effective for those times when the bare minimum is required. However, using this mode sets all your default dialer, contacts, and messaging (sms) apps back to the default Huawei apps (trash), and this persists when exiting ultra power saving mode. But, it's there if you need it in a pinch.V. Storage\nThe 32GB of built-in storage was plenty for me, but I decided to put in a 32GB Samsung microSD card, just for the fun of it. The tray was easy to remove, but I personally prefer methods that don't require a specific tool, as I dislike having to rummage for a paper clip every time I need to transfer files without an internet connection (surprisingly often, because I use my smartphone as a casual (and not too conspicuous) camera for photography at events) I did not appreciate the fact that Huawei removed Adoptable Storage, but it can be added back (with some bugs) through adb commands (just search Honor 8 Adoptable Storage - there's a how-to on MoDaCo).\nVI. Video\nThe Honor 8\u2019s video recording capabilities are mediocre at best - oftentimes, videos come out blurry and washed out, especially when digitally zoomed. The front facing camera is just okay, and while not special, it gets the job done for tasks like video calling. VII. Camera Rating\nWhile the front-facing camera is fine for video calling, selfies come out less than average, and the fixed focus makes the camera seem to lose concentration on you.\nThe level of customization that the Honor 8 camera app allows is quite nice - while I personally didn't find use for the \u201cpro mode\u201d, which allowed for custom ISO, shutter speed, white balance, and aperture, the controls seemed very encompassing when I tried them out.\nThe dual camera is one of the most highly-touted features of the Honor 8, and I must say the image quality is some of the best I have ever seen, apart from flagships like the Samsung Galaxy s7 and the Google Pixel XL. While optical zoom like on the iPhone 7 and OIS would have been a nice addition, the camera is still very capable. Unlike the iPhone 7, the Honor 8 uses the dual cameras to create higher-quality images, instead of optical zoom. One monochrome and one color sensor take a picture that is then sewn together by an algorithm - the advantage to this is that color sensors don't have as much clarity as monochrome sensors, due to the color-sensing layer on them, so the monochrome image restores that lost clarity and makes the image really pop.\nSome sample images taken on the Honor 8:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5...md4d3FBajhwZUE\nOne feature of the Honor 8 that I was really excited for (but was a bit disappointed by) was the artificial software depth of field effect - the ability to change the focus point of photos after you take a photo. However, the feature was a bit disappointing in that the edges of the subject you focused on would appear blurry, almost as if the algorithm had difficulty registering the edges of the object. So while it\u2019s more advanced than Instagram\u2019s \u201ctilt shift\u201d filter effect, I would not use it for professional photos. It is nice, however, for highlighting yourself in a selfie, while blurring out the background.Conclusion\nIn sum, the Honor 8 is for people who value looks in a device, and yet want power for their money. While I personally don\u2019t consider buying phones over $400 (Because a decent laptop can be around that cost), it is a great option, even in the face of phones like the OnePlus 3. The EMUI interface can be difficult to use, but if you have a basic knowledge of Android customization, it should be easy to get around it.

It allowed me to discover just how good the Moto software interface was. I've owned both the s7, s7 edge and the tab s2 tablet. I got rid of those quick bc of the terrible software. Anyways Verizon messed my billing all up so I dropped them and went to Cricket. I will say that my Z Force worked fine with Cricket but for me personally, i wanted nothing to do with Verizon any longer and the Z Force was bloated with Verizon apps. I alao had the Moto and generation 46mm smart watch. I ended up selling the entire kit with all my Moto mods too, to a cell phone store for over a grand as a package deal. I replaced the Z Force with the Nexus 6p bc the 6p is basically the same phone as the Moto Z family. Pure Android interface. This is why I stated that the Moto Z play isnt comparable to the Honor 8. You're getting two totally different devices and experiences with these two. The Moto Z play is more similar to the Nexus 6p but inferior performance wise and screen resolution wise. The Honor 8 has a unique and different feel and experience. I f I were choosing between the Z play and Honor 8 I'd choose the Honor 8. With the obvious exception that the Z play has the mods and stronger battery, your overall experience will be more enjoyed with the Honor 8. Faster processor. More ram. It's way more user friendly wirh one hand. These two just aren't comparable really by just the sheer size of the phone alone. 5.5 vs 5.2 real world is a huge difference. If you want the larger screen then of course get the Z play. For the money if it's not the screen size you care about the honor 8 offers way more than the Z play for the money. The Z play is what? 400 plus?? The honor 8 can be had right now for 300 I think. I paid 349 for mine. If you're getting a Moto then jump it up to the regular Moto Z or actually just get the Nexus 6p which will experience wise be identical to the Z play but far exceed in performance and screen resolution. Right now I have the Honor 8 and the 6p both very much flagship specs with more than well below market value. Bang for your buck. Remember with Moto your paying 25 percent more just for their advertising alone. Econmics come into play with the Moto line up or the Z lineup. Back to Verizon I also got tired of being locked to only their devices. I wanted to try out different phones. I let my Sony Xperia X go which by the way has the same processor as the Moto Z which is slower than the Honor 8 processor. I've enjoyed the Honor 8 as I briefly owned the blue model before exchanging it for my 6p. I keep two phones. One larger screen and one smaller screen for a one hander device and something I can put in my pocket. You get that too with the Honor 8 plus the bang for your hard earned money. These two devices just aren't comparable in my opinion. The 6p is more comparable to the Z play. It's hard to compare the Honor 8 to any device on the market. It's just that different and unique. Last word of advice, honestly although these aren't comparable, you can't go wrong with either that's for sure. Just the Honor 8 specs and value out weigh the Z play.", "time": "11-25-2016 06:35 PM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"postID": "post5580219", "text": "Thanks for the great insight!

[{"title": "My Honor 8 review take", "thread": [{"postID": "post5576961", "text": "Introduction\nAround these parts and various other places, there's a lot out there about the Honor 8. One might say that it gets a lot of hype. Is it worth it though, as a midrange device? Let's find out!\nFirst Impressions\nIt\u2019s a very cohesive phone. There\u2019s nothing about it that is jarring or sticks out. I am a fan of how the front and back of this phone is generally flush. The glass back feels excellent to hold. This phone is not water resistant and that personally doesn\u2019t bother me in the least. The Honor 8 was designed with 15 layers of glass on the back which makes for a very cool effect when light reflects on it. It\u2019s a solid one hand phone. The ear and mouth pieces are perfectly placed. For a 5.2\u201d screened phone, it\u2019s amazing how you get a lot of screen in a smaller body that is pocketable.\nExterior\nThe Honor 8 has two buttons placed on the right side of the phone. The volume rocker is a long button, and the power button is under it. It makes for a nice touch that the power button has grooves, which makes it easy to not mistakenly hit the wrong button.\nIn my usage, the fingerprint pad is perfectly placed on the rear of the phone. When holding it, the index finger naturally meets it so no effort is required to touch it. It unlocks almost instantly, without fail. Aside from it being very fast, it works as a button with excellent accuracy. Regardless of if I just washed my hands or recently put lotion on, it seems to work just the same. Honor programmed the fingerprint scanner to be more than just a scanner. You can program what happens when you press the button once, press and hold, and press the button twice. Those functions can be anything you choose, whether it is to open an app, open the camera, or activate the flashlight. Additionally, you can set it up to have it show your notifications by swiping down on the scanner.\nThe earpiece is great. Sometimes I find that if I use the in-call volume to increase the volume, it can sound like it is almost too loud. As a result, I find myself not having a need to increase the volume in a call often, if at all. As for the lone speaker itself, it's been average. In a mostly quiet room, you can hear the speaker at a low to moderate volume. However, a good amount of the time, I have needed to up the volume quite a bit to hear what I'm listening to. Because of that, I find myself not using the speaker much to listen to anything on my phone, unless I am in an environment I can control, such as my car, and my home. Even though I just stated that the volume can be low, I have had no issues hearing my phone or alarms ring at any point in time. As for the headphone jack, it's somewhat a similar experience to the earpiece. I have to note that I'm not an audiophile at all, but the sound is good here as well. \nUI\nThe Honor 8 has a 5.2\u201d screen 1080p IPS display. It has very deep blacks for an IPS display. This screen is viewable in sunlight and normal circumstances. The color temperature is a bit cool on whites out the box but there is a color temperature adjuster that allows you to set the temperature how you would like to be. During the review period, Honor has pushed out an update to fix the auto brightness, which I have seen improvements on in all situations. \nThe Honor 8 uses Emotion UI. It has a number of similarities to iOS, such as the lack of an app drawer and the settings menu. Whether you are fine with it or you hate it, it packs a lot of functionality, but it is a slight learning curve. An example of a cool feature is that you can set it to tap your knuckles on the screen to take a screenshot or do a screen capture. It also notifies you of power-intensive apps, and it stops apps from running in the background when the screen is off. You can tweak and disable that notification for select apps. \nThey include an abundance of their own system apps to use over the Google stock ones. Some examples are Email, Weather, Notes, Calendar, and Gallery. Something very interesting about the Calendar and Weather apps is that the icon shows the current condition, which is nice (I.e. temperature for Weather, date for Calendar). For that reason, I prefer to use the Calendar app. \nAdditionally, there are also some special apps that are unique to the UI, such as the Mirror app. Aside from the UI targeted apps, Booking.com, Facebook, Twitter, Shazam, News Republic and Lyft are preloaded to the phone, along with a few Honor apps for the community, store and support. All of those are removable.\nPhone Calls\nThis phone supports T-Mobile's VoLTE and Band 12, but no WiFi calling. Calls sounds great, thanks to active noise cancellation. There's even a in-call amplifier that allows you to increase the volume if needed during a call. The standard volume was loud enough for me, but this works very well in a call. In fact, sometimes when I increased it, it felt too loud so I would decrease it. For speakerphone, it is just OK. I can hear the person on the line well and they can also hear me, but it isn't very loud. \nKeyboard\nIt comes enabled with a default Swype keyboard by Huawei. I found it to be an annoying experience so I decided to use Google Keyboard instead, which has worked just fine. On the screen, the keys are well spaced and works well if you decide to use one hand or both hands to type.\nBattery\nTo start, there are three modes: Performance, Smart, and Ultra. The phone comes automatically set to Smart mode, which is the suggested mode for day to day usage, and that is the mode that I used throughout this review period. The battery life is good! For someone like me who get battery anxiety, but also don\u2019t want to be married to the charger, I have had no anxiety with this phone at all. For my usage, I get a day and 6 hours at minimum before putting it on the charger. I have run it down a few times to 4%, just for testing, and I was able to get almost 2 days on a single charge with 8 hours of screen on time. I check and post on social media, emails, occasional music and video streaming and a lot of reading. If anything, this phone will get through an entire day without disabling features. I have a smart band connected via Bluetooth at all times, and the battery life doesn't respond differently with or without Bluetooth. There is also a ROG mode that allows you to gain at least an additional hour of battery life by reducing the resolution down to 720p over the native 1080p. I was able to charge this 3000mAh battery in less than 100 minutes or in 1 hour and 30 minutes.\nStorage\\Storage Expansion\n32GB is just enough for my personal needs in a phone but it\u2019s great that there\u2019s onboard microSD storage. Having the slot on the left on the phone is great.\nVideo\nAs for video, it is a very average experience on this phone. It's not horrible but it's not amazing. Let's just say that it does the job but is not strength of this phone. Zoom works well, but it is varied with how well it works, based on the amount of light available.\nCamera\nThere are eight modes on the front facing camera. The front facing camera launches with a \"beauty\" mode already on. The beauty mode aims to clear your imperfections. It doesn't force you to take a picture with it on though. You can tap the X to remove that mode altogether or just turn it down to 0, which is something that I do often. The selfie camera meets my desires for a front camera pretty well. Picture quality is good, and you get a neat little viewfinder on your screen that tells you where to look, along with a short countdown. \nThe Honor 8 dual cameras are true to color in settings with regular, daylight lighting. It lets in a lot of light naturally, and provides solid cameras for the price point. It holds its own well with the higher end phones. In low light, it generally does an average job with auto settings. The weakness of the cameras shows a bit more with low light photography. However, it is not a complete wash in the least, thanks to wide aperture mode. That mode does exactly what it sounds like it does, increase the aperture to allow for more light. Speaking of modes, it comes with sixteen different modes on the main cameras, including a good food mode for food pictures, document scan, and of course HDR.\nConclusion\nTo answer my original question, I would say that it is worth the hype to an extent. It is generally a solid device and it is in a class of it's own when it comes to performance, cameras, one hand usage all while still fitting in the pocket decently. The midrange might have a lot of competition but when it comes to those three things together, there is no other. All in all, this device will probably work well for many and it is worth the hype.\nPhoto Samples", "time": "11-23-2016 11:45 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5576969", "text": "Great review and nice pictures!", "time": "11-23-2016 11:51 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5578335", "text": "It's the little things that I miss ever since I sold my H8.

I was a bit sceptical from the get go since my experience with the Honor 5X wasn't that great. But that is also a completely different device. This year, the kitchen got really hot with $400 phones specd very close to high end flagships. Let's see how this puppy does!I. Exterior Look and Feel \u2013 first impressionsThe Honor 8 looks really sharp and feels like a high end device, similar to the Galaxy S6. Both the front and rear utilize 2.5D glass which makes it look really nice. You can really see and feel that Honor put a lot of attention into detail when you roll your hands around the front edge to sides to back\u2026the way it seamlessly flows from the front glass to the rounded and chamfered aluminum side band and then to the back glass. Speaking of the back glass, Honor used a 15-layer glass to refract light, which gives it some very fun light patterns. \nThe phone has no water resistance, however, you won\u2019t be able to find the same caliber phone with water resistance in this price range. I do prefer a phone with water resistance, but it isn\u2019t a deal breaker for me as I have owned many phones and haven\u2019t had any phones that have been water damaged.The 5.2\u201d screen is a bit small and I personally prefer 5.5-5.7\u201d, but admittedly, the Honor 8 is much easier to comfortably use one handed compared to larger phones, in part due to the screen size, and in part due to the small side bezels. The glass back design makes it feel a bit slippery. You can use a thin case or a wrap to help with this regard. In addition to helping with the slipperiness, a case or wrap can also help protect the back from scratches, as I have read on the forums that many people who go naked end up getting scratches on the back glass. While Honor does offer 3 months of screen protection, beware that it only covers cracks, not scratches.II. Exterior FunctionalityThe Honor 8 follows the standard Android button configuration with the volume buttons on the top right side and the power button just below it. It isn\u2019t my favorite configuration,and I have accidentally mixed up the volume down and power buttons before. With that said, the power button does have a tactile feedback to help distinguish it from the volume button, however, this can be lost when using a case. \nThe fingerprint reader is very fast and accurate. In my usage more accurate than on my Galaxy devices. The placement is perfect for my index finger when holding the phone in either the left or right hand. The only downside is that I use my phone on the desk a lot so I have to either use the power button and enter the pin, or pick up the phone and use the fingerprint scanner, though neither option is ideal. I really like using the fingerprint scanner because it is very quick to use, compared to having to enter a pin, which to be honest, I rarely used before the advent of the fingerprint scanner.\nIn addition to turning the phone on, the fingerprint scanner can be used to take a photo, answer a call, stop an alarm, show the notification panel, clear the notification panel, close the notification panel, and browse photos by swiping left or right. I find the shortcuts to open and close the notification particularly useful when using the phone one handed. You can also use what Honor calls the \u201cSmart key\u201d feature which allows you to set certain actions to the single click, double click, and long press of the fingerprint scanner. I set the single click to open the camera which allows me to quickly open the camera.\nCall quality coming from the earpiece was good. Both the sending and receiving side was clear and VoLTE worked on T-mobile. Call quality from the speakerphone was acceptable but it sounded a little tinny and slightly distorted. You can hear the other person just fine, although it isn't the highest quality. Probably average compared to other phones. Voice dialing and voice commands worked well most of the time. III. UX Look and Feel: First ImpressionsThe 5.2\u201d full HD screen looks excellent. I have used it to watch videos, play games, and look at photos and everything looked great. It isn't QHD, but honestly I couldn't see a difference in my usage. I do prefer a larger screen for video consumption but this is personal preference. There were some early complaints about the auto brightness but with the latest update, auto brightness works fine for me. The proximity sensor also properly turns off the screen when I am on a call and move the phone to my ear and turns it back on when I move it away from my ear. The screen is very sensitive and I rarely ever have wrong touches or need to touch twice. The screen also registers touches from my fingernail, something that the iPhone doesn't do. \nThe biggest departure in the UI from standard Android would be the lack of app tray. It should feel very familiar for those coming from iOS. All new apps are added to the home screen. You can customize the order of the apps and also put them in folders, but that's about it. I have over 100 apps, and it took some time to setup, but if you only have a few apps then it wouldn't be a big deal. I tried it out this configuration for a few days but ultimately installed Nova launcher which has the added advantage of restoring the layout from my old Android phone. \nThe Honor 8 has duplicate apps for Gmail/email and calendar and unfortunately neither can be removed. It can cause some confusion, and I wished that they would either stick to one or the other. Personally, I prefer the Google versions simply because I use many phones, so using the Google version gives it an uniform experience across my android devices. The phone comes with Chrome pre-installed, and it works about as well as on my other Android phones which is to say that it works well most of the time but occasionally it does have hiccups. I found that both Safari on the iPhone SE and the Internet app on Galaxy devices provided a significantly smoother browsing experience. The Netflix app also loaded much slower when not in memory compared to my iPhone SE which could be partially attributed to better optimized apps on iOS, but even compared to my Moto Z Play, it loaded about two seconds slower and took about two seconds longer to open a video. It normally isn't a big deal but I have an impatient young child who doesn\u2019t like delays. The video did play without any stuttering. I didn't have an issue with the speed of any other regular apps. Intensive games like Asphalt 8 take a long time to load, but that is pretty normal. Asphalt 8 also caused the phone to run a little warm, but it never got hot at any time.\nEMUI 5.0 / Android 7.0I received the EMUI 5.0/Android 7.0 Beta update (B317) right before I completed the review. As it is beta, things can still change, however, the look and feel of EMUI 5.0 is much closer to what most Android users expect. By default, all apps are thrown on the home screen, BUT there is an option to use the app drawer now. New features to Android 7.0 like split screen and double tap the multi-task window to quick switch work fine. The one significant deviation from stock Android that I could see is that it doesn\u2019t show the app icons in the notification bar. Instead, it shows a number to indicate how many apps have notifications in the upper left:\nAlthough it didn\u2019t bother me much, one of the complaints some people had was about the notification panel, which should be resolved now with EMUI 5. Notifications are grouped by app, and overall are much closer to stock Android than EMUI 4. You can swipe right on each notification and tap on the cog wheel to access the notification settings for the app. You can also long press the notification for some quick notification settings. The toggles in the notification bar are somewhat similar to what you see in a Samsung phone, and it does give you information like the Wi-Fi network that you are connected to and the Bluetooth device connected. Long pressing the Wi-Fi icon will take you into the Wi-Fi settings, and so forth. The toggles can also be customized.\nI have only used EMUI 5.0 Beta for a few hours, but everything seems to be working well. I haven\u2019t seen any app crashes either. IV. Phone callsDiscussed under section II V. Keyboard The stock keyboard app is the Swype keyboard. This is a capable keyboard and has some customizations, but it does not have an option for a number row or arrow keys. I used it for a bit but then switched back to Swiftkey keyboard which is what I use on all my Androids. For those coming from iOS, you should be aware that it doesn\u2019t have the 3D touch keyboard scroll option. This isn\u2019t a big deal for me with Swiftkey though, as it has arrow keys. Both the stock keyboard and Swiftkey has the voice option using Google\u2019s voice system. In my usage, it is pretty accurate as well. The keyboard can also be resized, something that can\u2019t be done in the stock iOS keyboard. VI. BatteryBattery life is very good. I can get 6-8 hours SOT in a typical day using Gmail, Hangouts, and Chrome. Adding in heavy streaming through Netflix or Youtube was slightly less. I played Asphalt 8 a bit, which is a pretty power intensive game, which drained the battery pretty quickly, and caused the phone to get a little warm. Using the camera for extended periods of time will also cause the phone to get slightly warm, but not hot, and battery life for extended camera usage is very good. Overall, battery life is pretty impressive considering high end CPU and 3,000 mah battery. It gets better battery life than my S7 Edge and never gets hot, only slightly warm whereas my S7 Edge got hot enough that it restarted itself on several occasions. \nI use a regular 10W (5V/2A) charger, and it did 33% in half an hour, and 14% to 84% took 64 minutes using the same charger. Honor states that it will do up to 47% in half an hour using the included charger. Honor also states that a full charge will take 100 minutes. Keep in mind that the stock charger is proprietary, so you won\u2019t get fast charging speeds unless you use the stock charger. Still, great battery life and decent charging speeds even with regular charging should be adequate for most people. Please note that this phone, as with most non-Google high end USB C phones this year, does not fully comply with USB C specs, so caution should be used when using third party chargers. Although, I have used a variety of chargers including Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 ones, and I didn\u2019t have any problems. The change to USB C is also a nice change as it is reversible so you never have to worry about sticking it in the wrong way. VII. Built-in Storage VIII Storage expansionThe base Honor 8 has 32gb internal storage with a microSD expansion slot which is located in the upper left of the phone. Personally, I use the internal storage for all the apps, and use the SD card for all media, and this setup has worked well for me, and most likely for most people. Honor also has a 64gb option for those who need a little more storage. Please keep in mind that Honor doesn\u2019t support adoptable storage, which the vast majority of people won\u2019t need with 64gb internal.XI. VideoThe video quality is good for it\u2019s price range. Strangely, it lacks 4K video recording, which is available for other phones in its class, although it does support fHD 60 fps. It utilizes digital zoom which degrades the image quality a bit when zooming in, but it is expected for phones in it\u2019s price range.The front video camera is capable of 1080p, and the quality is pretty good, more than adequate for video calling. There is a beauty video mode, which by default makes the image very soft, although you can adjust the softness using the on-screen slider. \nXII. Camera RatingThe front-facing camera is good quality. In selfie photos, the iPhone 7 Plus gave more detail. Most people would be fine with the Honor 8 camera, given the price range. \nUsing the stock camera app, swiping left will let you choose from one of sixteen(!) shooting styles. If you are one who likes to tinker, then you will be very happy with the Honor 8. It provides lots of styles and the pro mode gives you a lot of control. Those who prefer a simple camera might be a bit overwhelmed though. Swiping right brings you to the camera settings screen. \nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the Honor 8 is the dual rear cameras.  There is one for color and one for monochrome which Honor says allows for more light and increased sharpness. Combined, they allow you to capture more detailed photos. Overall, I am impressed with the camera on the Honor 8. It provides very good quality pictures for the price point. It won\u2019t beat the S7 or Iphone 7 Plus, but it isn\u2019t that far behind. I usually don\u2019t shoot in black and white, but given that this phone has a monochrome lens, I tested out the black and white mode and found it to be good, though a little less sharp than the iPhone 7 Plus. Burst mode works well and there was no delay in taking shots and saving to internal memory. \nHonor provides an HDR mode, although there is no auto HDR option, which is a little inconvenient. You have to select it through the mode menu by swiping right. With that said, I took a few HDR shots and I really couldn\u2019t see any difference compared to regular shots. I even double and triple checked to make sure that HDR mode was on. \nAnother nice feature is depth of field photos which can be activated by using the wide aperture mode, which allows you to blur the background. In my usage, the Honor 8 had a noticeable tendency to incorrectly blur items in the foreground than the iPhone 7 Plus as showcased in the images below with the ears of the dog and two smaller boxes blurred and in the second picture, with the tag near the front leg and the eye being incorrectly blurred. In both cases, the iPhone 7 Plus did a better job at blurring the right portions. Although, the iPhone uses the telephoto lens with a significantly lower aperture, which causes shots in lower light situations to be noticeably more grainy than the Honor 8 as seen in the last photo with the stapler. Finally, I feel that the iPhone blur effect feels noticeably more natural than the Honor 8. With that said, again, the Honor 8 is half the price, and the iPhone shots don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s twice as good. \n(Top shots Honor 8, bottom iPhone 7 Plus) \n1.2.3.\nIndoor shots are excellent quality for the price range, and the flash is bright enough to illuminate a small pitch black room. This is true both with and without flash. The camera really shines in low light and outperforms the competition. Burst shots were good indoors, although they tend to be more grainy and show less detail than regular shots, which is to be expected. \nOutdoor shots were excellent quality. Under ideal conditions, you would be hard pressed to tell the difference between shots taken with the Honor 8 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The Honor 8 did admirably in situations that are slightly less than ideal such as cloudy skies and morning/afternoon as well.\nIn night shots, the Honor 8 tended to provide darker shots compared to the iPhone 7 Plus, and also had less detail. However, there are some situations where this situation works to it\u2019s benefit and provides a more accurate shot than the iPhone 7 Plus. I should also mention that the Moto Z Play night photos tend to make the photos extra bright but also tends to be very noisy. \nI also did a comparison between the Honor 8 and iPhone 7 Plus and Moto Z Play Droid in low light:http://forums.androidcentral.com/hon...ime-shots.htmlhttp://forums.androidcentral.com/hon...ht-photos.html\nOverall, I am very impressed with the Honor 8 camera. It performs on par with phones which cost significantly more in well lit situations. In low light situations, it is still very good, but the sharpness isn\u2019t on par with phones that cost significantly more, but the difference isn\u2019t that big, and only really noticeable when you zoom in. Hands down, this is the best overall smartphone camera that you can buy in the $400 price range. Conclusion \nOverall, I think that the Honor 8 is the most well rounded phone in its price range. It has very good battery life for a high end CPU, and the build feels like a premium smartphone. To top it off, it adds a best in its class dual camera setup. You can't go wrong with one at the retail price of $400, and for Black Friday, it will be $300!", "time": "11-23-2016 11:26 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5576977", "text": "Awesome review, really enjoyed your range of pictures in various situations here!", "time": "11-23-2016 11:54 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5576978", "text": "Where are the DoF comparison shots?", "time": "11-23-2016 11:56 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5577024", "text": "Look at the pictures with the dog, turtle, and stapler.", "time": "11-23-2016 12:32 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5577077", "text": "That was weird.

As far as the first impression of the phone goes, this phone is just WOW.\nLet's talk about the initial impression and the hands on review of the phone.\nPhone is amazing in look and feel and does the job pretty well in terms of performance. Laid my hands on the phone for good 15-20 minutes and found phone is doing very well with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM to enable flawless multitasking. There were no games installed on the phone but I opened up all the applications and settings in the phone and tried to switch between the apps and it was buttery smooth with no lag. Phone is powered by Huawei\u2019s in house Hi-Silicon Kirin 950 octa core chipset (4x2.3 GHz Cortex-A72 & 4x1.8 GHz Cortex A53) with i5 co-processor and leading 16nm FinFET plus SoC. \nsee below, even with all the apps open, we still have more than 2.5 GB free RAM which will allow us to use the multitasking at its peak and to the fullest level.\nPhone is not bulky in weight and 5.2 inch size makes it perfect fir to the palm. These phones can be used by girls or parents with smaller palm and is really fits in into the hand properly without any trouble to hold the big phone. \nThe 5.2-inch FHD display with a 96% NTSC, color enhancement, and dynamic pixel-level contrast adjustment provides a better viewing experience, with vivid and crisp images. The display looks stunning as well as the phone in terms of look and design.\nHonor 8 comes with The innovative bionic 12MP dual lenses, one lens allows for rich color and the other lens is monochrome to give your images more details, light and increased sharpness. Together they help you capture crisper, more detailed photos of stunning quality to match up the standard of a DSLR camera. Phone has a built-in dual ISP which improves focus, speed, and process time when you take pictures and hence the images are more stabilized, crisp and of best quality. Phone has a 8 MP front shooter as well with perfect selfie mode to give you the best in class selfie images.\nSelfie Sample-\nThe Honor 8 variant launched in India comes with 32GB of inbuilt storage and is expandable via microSD card (up to 128GB). On connectivity options, the Honor 8 includes 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (latest ac band is included for faster and better Wi-Fi connectivity), Bluetooth v4.2 which supports Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and fast charging support.\nPhone will be available in few latest and popular color options in the market mainly Pearl White, Sapphire Blue, Sunrise Gold color variants in India. The sapphire blue color looks stunning and now we know the reason why the same was liked and appreciated in the European market and phone became very popular in the region and will surely start a trend of new color for handset.\nLink to my original post on Honor Community", "time": "10-17-2016 07:17 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5499418", "text": "How much did you pay for it in India?", "time": "10-17-2016 09:57 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5499595", "text": "29,999 INR..little bit costly than the one available in Eruope but still completely worth its price.", "time": "10-17-2016 11:05 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post5500171", "text": "I enjoyed reading your impressions, thank you!", "time": "10-17-2016 02:48 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5500504", "text": "Thank you for the stunning review on the Honor 8!

It costs 410 Euros to buy one out of contract here in Sweden. However, currently you can buy one on-contract for a heavily recuded price. A phone company has a campain this month, and as I'm a student I get another 20% off the sale that's already on the phone's current price. That means I'll be paying 24 Euros a month over a period of 2 years. Only 4 of those Euros is paid monthly for the phone, meaning that it costs 100 Euros in total.

I'm pretty sure I'm going to role with the stock launcher it came with. I still have quite a bit of app organizing but for now this is what my home page is looking like. It'll change some but not much. I may add or take some apps but I like a simple home page with my most used apps. The rest of my pages are organized by category of their intended use. Functional interface like adobe, word, google keep and so on gets a page. Then my purchasing page, Amazon, best buy, and you get the picture. Music and videos get a page too. I had it narrowed down to the Nexus 6p and this one. Tried the 6p last night and actually loved it. It was hard to make the exchange. Tipping point for the exchange, no expandable memory which my price range was the 32g. It ate at me. My other phone is a Sony Xperia X 5 inch so the Nexus was the perfect opposite at 5.7 inches. Then I read a few negative reviews on this interface and made it even harder to exchange. That and it being so close in size to my Sony. I use a lot of space so I did it. My eyes are tired bc this cool phone has been a blast today. Only thing I'd change would be to have that 6p's resolution but 1080p is plenty anyways. Glad I made the swap.

Yesterday continued the trend.\nI wanted to see the Honor 8 in person, so I went to my \"local\" Best Buy (40 minutes away). I asked if they had an Honor 8 demo. The clerk pointed to a phone at an endcap by itself. The display label stated Nexus 6P. The phone had a huge security lock on the back (bigger than that on other phones), so it was difficult to get a good feel of it. There was no power to it, and they didn't have another working unit. Even though blue is currently a Best Buy exclusive color, the one on display was white. The sales guy was like, \"I think it's also available in black and maybe blue.\" Slightly passive-aggressively, I told him blue was a Best Buy exclusive. I don't expect employees to be as knowledgeable as someone who has spent a lot of time researching a tech item, but Best Buy employees frequently aren't aware of the store's own promotions.\nI decided to drive 20 minutes to the Best Buy Mobile store in a nearby mall. None of the phones had powered displays except for an iPhone SE and a cheap BLU phone. I asked if they had the Honor 8. They didn't have it on display, yet, but they had a demo unit. She went to the back and came back with a silver phone. I quickly realized it wasn't an Honor 8 (maybe an Honor 7?) and when I told her I didn't think it was the 8, she said, \"Yes, it is. I can even check the settings to make sure.\" She took the phone, checked the settings, then said, \"Oh. Yeah. This isn't the Honor 8.\"\nFortunately, they did have a working unit, so I eventually was able to test it out. I was impressed with the camera but I didn't test a few other aspects b/c I don't think it had internet access and the sales clerk was looking over my shoulder most of the time.\nFor Best Buy to be one of the few exclusive US sellers, they're doing a poor job of it...In other news, I think I'm going to buy the Honor 8!

I typically shop at best buy bc they price match. Plus I like to get my phones immediately rather than wait on shipping. Sad thing is she still works there. There is no customer service left these days. Everyone is lazy and don't care. They don't fear their job loss evident by this. When I'm pushed, I can raise some pretty loud and harsh Caine.

I had the Moto Z Force but I like having at least one large screen device. I got the Nexus 6p but only for a night as I knew the 32g wasnt enough. Exchanged it for my Honor 8. End of the month I'm actually going to order another Nexus 6p but in a 64g. Another Android phone I like is Sony. Phones are underrated but it's due to inflated values they keep doing. Economics 101 they deeply fall short in. I've got the Sony Xperia X but I was able to get it for 199 so I saved quite a bit. Now that leaves me with a 5 inch and 5.2 inch. So now my next will be a 5.7 in some type of device. Anyone of you Android purest have any advice on a larger screen Android I should check out instead of the Nexus 6p? As for apple. I may get the iPhone 8 if it's as innovated as rumored to be. I love innovation and unique things. Its why I like the honor 8. I do miss my Moto Z Force. It was a great phone. I will say when it comes to tablets, apple is the winner. I had the tab s2 9.7 and it didn't come near the iPad pro 9.7. My next phone I want to be pretty large as I will use it alot for work and to watch movies on. Note 7 is out and not bc of the battery but the terrible software. It lags and it's sticky.

This is my OPINION not a spec shoot out or a scientific test. I came from a Nexus 6p and tried real hard to love the size of the phone but it was just too big for me. I like a pocket-able phone that can be used one handed quickly. So I ended up buying an Honor 8\u2026. It seemed to be kismet given the timing of my decision to buy a new phone and the Honor 8\u2019s release. \nThe Honor 8 wins\u2019 hands down on everything from fingerprint sensor to looks. I will say the stock launcher is a little worse than the Galaxy IF you are already used to using android. If you are coming from iOS, I think it\u2019s a great UI to start with. I personally use google now launcher for all of my phones. Did I mention this phone is beautiful? It really is, there is something about it. The day to day is nice, fast fingerprint recognition which is akin to my 6p, \u201csmart button\u201d features are awesome, and I have no problem getting through a day on a single charge. \nThen came the S7. It quite literally fell in my lap and after a few days of use I came to realize the S7 is the phone for me. Mainly due to the ridiculously fast camera focus, IS, and just a touch smaller which works for my hobbit hands. The fingerprint reader feels clunky and only works about 60% of the time on the first try\u2026 I will really miss USB-C as well. For me it was all about the camera. I have a 5-year-old and it\u2019s hard enough to get a shot in time without having to worry about good technique and focus prediction. \nAnyways, I\u2019ll be selling my Honor and keeping the S7\u2026 Which tbh kind of hurts just thinking about it. But I know someone will really enjoy the phone and I don\u2019t want it to sit in a drawer for the foreseeable future.", "time": "09-26-2016 03:23 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5449055", "text": "S7 is really a great choice.

I am trying to figure out how to change the lock screen image, where to get themes from (4 are preinstalled; basically the ones that match all of the Honor 8 colors), etc.\n-It feels great in the hand, and it is actually slightly less wider than my 5\" phone currently.\n-Downloading a lot of apps at once didn't make the phone very hot, it barely got warm actually.\n-For some reason, configuring the keyboard keeps popping up in notifications. On that note, if you disable Huawei swype, it disables google keyboard too, which I don't understand?\n-It's a fingerprint magnet for sure, but since I have the white, direct light is really the only way to see them.\n-I haven't tried the fingerprint sensor yet to comment on that.\n-The silent mode in settings is awesome!\n-VoLTE is set up right out of the box for T-Mobile, I didn't have to do anything.\n-The SIM tray looks like it could be dual sim too (maybe disabled or something?) since I was able to fit my SIM in there BUT I was not up for testing that.\n-The speaker is just okay. I haven't tested a call yet though to say how that is. I will in the near future, hopefully.\n-Cameras seem to be decent too, better than my old Nextbit Robin, I'll say.

Be warned. I'll include a tl;dr version after this text, but just wanted to give a heads up.\nShort and sweet version:\n-Battery life is great, you can get a day easily.\n-Cameras are nice, video isn't horrible or anything, just very average.\n-Sound is average too.\n-Great in hand for one-handed usage, but be wary of scratches on the glass back, also very slippery.\n-UI is very iOS like, but it does have some cool things, such as using your knuckles to take a screenshot.\n-Notifications are fickle, some apps don't work so well, but the social apps generally work.\n-Auto brightness is random and fickle too, can easily go from medium to low to high.\n-Great connectivity all around, some of the best I have had in a phone.\n-Band 12, VoLTE work well on T-Mobile, but no WiFi calling.\nA little more detailed:\nSystem:\n-The battery life is awesome! I always get over a day. I have battery paranoia/anxiety, but with this phone it's a non issue and that is how I personally prefer for my phones to be, especially coming from an iPhone SE where this is never an issue. I have had 8h of SOT.\n-The screen is kind of cold on whites out the box in my opinion, but you do have a color profile to change it to how you like. I changed mine.\n-I am personally pleased with the cameras. Low light pictures are alright.\n-Video is okay, but I'm not one for videos so I can't comment there.\n-The sound is average, it sounds better than the Nexus 5x, but it's not amazing.\nDesign:\n-It's really nice in the hand, great for one-handed usage. The fact it comes in black, white, and blue stateside is awesome. I'm really liking that the Honor in white, truly looks like a white device and not a silver device that appears to be white.\n-I like the aesthetic of the glass back, but in almost 3 days, I have scratches on the back on some edges. This is my first glass backed phone, so having to be aware what I am putting the phone on top of, is a new concept to me.\n-Speaking of glass back, this phone very much slides off of surfaces, which is kind of scary. It sticks better if you place on something with texture. With no texture, it will slide off. True story: Every time I wake up, my phone is in a different place because it slides to a different area of my bed.\nUI:\n-As for the UI, when they say that it is very iOS like, it is. Settings can be randomly placed, but thankfully you have the option to search in settings, which saves time for sure. \n-The themes are alright, I went with the one that matched my phone out of laziness. If you keep the theme, you are able to search through all of your apps for whatever you want.\n-Notifications are fickle. With some apps, notifications don't even appear at all, even if you have them enabled in the app itself and in the phone settings. For me, I'm a baseball fan so At Bat is something I use on every phone (usually; Windows Phone aside). With it, notifications just don't work at all. I did a test and installed ESPN, set them just the same (just not with lock screen) and yet I got all of those. It's very much app dependent but for the social apps, I do get all of my notifications (usually).\n-I like some features that the UI has, such as the knuckle gesture to take a screenshot or screen capture. It also has a setting where it can detect if the phone is in your pocket or phone and with that, it doesn't wake up the phone, which is awesome (looking at you, Doze).\n-The auto brightness is also fickle. It can go from 60% to 20%. Every once in a while, I felt the need the up the brightness but otherwise, I still stick with the fickle auto brightness because I haven't been in a situation where it's been too bright or too dark on auto much.\n-There is a learning curve with this UI. This is day 6 and I think I have a handle on it, mostly.\nConnectivity:\n-This phone has some of the best connectivity I have ever had in a phone for both mobile data and WiFi. It is just excellent. I am very impressed.\n-No WiFi calling on T-Mobile, but the VoLTE works great, no set up needed. Band 12 works well here too.\n-Noise cancellation is great on phone calls.\n-For MMS, it shows a small preview of the image and you have to click said image to actually see the whole thing. It's different and I figured that it was worth noting.\nI think that's it. As for if I am going to keep this Honor, I'm trying to weigh everything. Do I recommend it though, heck yeah! It's great, if you can get past the iOS like UI, fickle auto brightness and notifications. If those things will really bother you, I would suggest skipping this phone.

The first part is an Honor 8 Gallery Showcase, where pictures of the Honor 8 can be shown off and you will have the chance to share your own. The second part is a standard Report, and will focus on the pricing of the Honor 8 in comparison to other phones in similar price ranges.\nUPDATE: Yesterday's Report, focused on ROMs and customization, may have been confirmed by this article Huawei Honor 8 to get two years of software updates, maybe custom ROM support - Liliputing . Also, @wimbet has confirmed that the Honor 8 will recieve updates for at least 2 years https://plus.google.com/+TaylorWimbe...ts/FwiB7hZsGj9Part One:\nHere are a collection of pictures, both promotional and consumer-taken, of the Honor 8. Feel free to comment and add your own pictures to the mix!Part Two\nIn comparison to other phones in the $399 range, the Honor 8 will really have to prove its worth. Going up against the likes of the OnePlus 3 and the ZTE Axon 7, the Honor 8 introduces a unique way to approach what is quickly becoming a saturated mid-range sector. Design\nI believe that the Honor 8 wins in design when compared to the OnePlus 3 and the Axon 7, as they both seem rather plain and dull in comparison to the futuristic design of the Honor 8. The Honor 8 has also been guaranteed support for updates for at least two years, so it has a very stable update plan, unlike the Axon 7. Developer Support\nHowever, the OnePlus 3 wins in developer support, being one of the most popular phones for customization and modification. All there are futureproofed with USB-C, so they will last quite a while if you intend on using it as a daily driver for a few years to come. Stock Android\nLastly, the OnePlus 3 and Axon 7 both win over the Honor 8 for those who prefer stock Android, however, custom ROMs will be coming soon, and I personally enjoy the little customizations that Huawei has added to Android, although many of my fellow Honor 5X beta testers may disagree. EMUI has come a long way, and with the guaranteee of updates for two years, I am really excited for EMUI 5, which is supposed to be a lot closer to stock Android than any EMUI before. \nSo, the verdict? The Honor 8 is a great phone capable of holding its own, even when put up against the likes of the OnePlus 3 and the Axon 7. The $50 coupon only adds to its value, so buying sooner rather than later might be a good idea. Then again, fall discounts are very steep in the US, so waiting for the fall might be a good idea.\nHappy Androiding!\n-Lumi Valo", "time": "08-19-2016 10:51 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5345331", "text": "Great post!\nThis video does a great job of showing off the EMUI features, I was surprised by some of the clever stuff they baked in.

Here is a rundown of my estimates and thoughts on customization available for the Honor 8.Root\nRoot has been achieved on other Honor devices like the Honor 5X, so I am of the opinion that it is only a matter of time before the Honor 8 will get root. It may be sooner than you expect, as I have news from another developer that progress is going very smoothly...TWRP (and other custom recoveries)\nThe official Honor website for a bootloader unlock is down, so you may have to turn to a third-party bootloader unlock code or contact customer support (not fun). Nevertheless, I fully expect custom recoveries to be on the Honor 5X to be available by the end of September.ROMs\nWith active developer support from sites like XDA and, of course, Android Central, custom ROMs are definitely going to happen. Huawei has already released the kernel sources for the Kirin chips, so it is only a matter of time before the ROMs debut.\nIn the meantime, the EMUI theming engine is quite powerful, and I would definitely recommend trying it out to anyone who plans to remain on stock (as I do, for Android Pay).

Bob Quin Yeh, Vice President of Honor returned to Europe LSA on branding.\nPreviously the range of smartphones 300-400 euros was very restricted. Today, Honor France is growing rapidly in this price range. We realized 700% growth between 2014 and 2015, and again 700% growth since early 2016 in France. We wish to extend this market considerably. With our new smartphone, the Honor 8, we want to reach the largest number of consumers.\nOn what does the success of Honor?\n*\nBob Quin Yeh, VP Europe of Honor\nBob Ye Quin: This success is the target of Honor, we focus on the \"digital natives\", our customer community. More than a sales channel, e-commerce is a partner. Our philosophy is a quality product at an affordable price. Selling online allows us behind to provide better prices to our customers.\nWhy Honor products will also be available in physics teaches?\nBob Ye Quin: By being available only online, we do not touch any \"digital natives\", especially those who do their research online before heading in store. We launched a model O2O (online to offline) and our products are now available in physical stores, Darty and Bouygues. We carefully select our partners to provide the best possible in-store experience to our customers. This is a real cooperation and our employees have to play the game, understand the Honor brand, understand the business model, and believe. They must offer a true shopping experience.\nAre you planning to communicate via devices other than social networking?\nBob Ye Quin: Online communication is our strength and this will never change. By contrast, the communication on television is always expensive. The profit we realize by not communicating on television, we r\u00e9injectons directly into our products because our priority is the consumer. If ever we were to communicate to other media, like television, it would be a very limited way, and to generate commitment. We communicate to generate consumer engagement, showing our closeness to him.\nHow to Honor revolves compared to Huawei, the parent?\nBob Ye Quin Huawei and Honor are two independent brands, there are 2 2 marketing teams and sales teams. Honor belongs to the entity Huawei Consumer Business Group. R & D is common to provide our customers with the best technology. This makes Honor a successful brand because we have 16 R & D centers and 74 000 people who work for us. We imagine our products for our target, we wonder what they expect. Everyone wants to be unique, different, having its own identity, the goal is to stand for the consumer to have a unique product in the hands.\"\"Nous r\u00e9alisons 700% de croissance en...", "time": "08-31-2016 08:10 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Knuckle touch technology on the Honor 8", "thread": [{"postID": "post5379779", "text": "Read this...

With a glossy back like the Samsung Galaxy s6/s7, the Honor 8 delivers on Honor's promise of flagship design, without flagship cost. While many were indifferent when Samsung decided to redesign their \"s\" line with a premium design, the premium design on the Honor 8 was much appreciated due to the lower cost and the thought which they put into it (plus, it does look really cool). \nHowever, I am most definitely not saying that the Honor 8 is a ripoff. While the original design may have been inspired by that of Samsung, I am of the opinion that the Honor 8 looks better on account of the highly-touted 15 layers of glass (buzzword alert) that give it a seemingly deeper or more textured feel. \nWhile the look of a phone is not something that is particularly high on my personal list of requirements, there is no doubt that smartphones are becoming less like tools and more like fashion accessories. The Honor 8 makes that fashion statement, at a low cost.\nHappy Androiding!\n(note: the Honor 8 report will most likely be discontinued after around September 7th, as I begin school at that time.

With one monochrome and one color sensor, it is supposed to provide higher image quality and better autofocus, and can assist with depth of field measurement, similar to the way human eyes work.\nMany suspect that the camera system may even be the same as the one used in the Huawei P9, just without the (expensive) Leica branding, that was mainly an exercise in buzzwords and marketing techniques.\nWhile the Honor 8 software engine for image processing may not be as strong as, for example, the one used in the Samsung Galaxy s7, it is still quite good. Even in low-light situations, the Honor 8 manages to take impressively sharp pictures, and the dual tone flash is an added bonus for keeping skin tones looking natural in any lighting situation. The forward-facing flash mechanism that essentially lights up the whole screen as a flash is a nice feature, but I wish that it automatically calibrated to match skin tone, something that only the iPhone has done so far. (Maybe that's a little too much to expect out of a budget device, but it would certainly be useful)\nWhile I wouldn't have bought the Honor 8 simply because of the dual camera system, it is admittedly a very nice thing to have, not to mention the many chances you'll have to show off your phone as one of the latest and greatest, and really have it stand out.\nWhat do you think about the dual camera in the Honor 8?

With a top-line SoC, oodles of RAM, a premium camera, beautiful display, and a flashy design, the Honor 8 is certainly a great phone. \nBut no phone is perfect, and the Honor 8 is no exception. Here is a list of the top five things I think Honor could have done better:1. EMUI\nEMUI, while improved, is still a major slowdown, with an interface all too similar to that fruit company (which is not inherently bad, but it is built in a way that uses a lot of processing power and battery), and some features which many may deem unnecessary. I personally enjoy much of EMUI, but I think it could be drastically improved, and with EMUI 5.0 around the corner, it's never too late for Honor to make the Honor 8 even better.2. Battery Life\nThe Honor 8 has a much larger battery than many of its competitors; even flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy s7 have a smaller battery capacity, so it would be reasonable to expect it to have battery life better or at least on par with those phones. Sadly, this is not the case. With EMUI and a battery manager that does more harm than good, battery life is, in my opinion, one of the weakest selling points of the phone. However, I do love the direction that Huawei is taking with Quick Charge on the Honor 8, so steps are being made in the right direction. While by no means terrible, the Honor 8 battery could definitely be improved on, and I know that Huawei can do it.3. Display\nAgain, the display is great. I love the crispness of it. However, with VR becoming more and more widespread, a higher-resolution display could really have futureproofed this device.4. Button Placement\nYes, this is a Huawei thing, and they're probably not going to change it. With button placement being on of the only things that the average (read: non Android Central-using) user has to differentiate devices, button placement could really be a sore point of the Honor 8. With the power button uncomfortably below the volume buttons, it can be easy to turn off the device when adjusting volume. Again, not a deal-breaker, and I mostly use the fingerprint sensor to unlock anyway, but having a more user-friendly button layout would be really helpful on the Honor 8.5. This one's for you!\nDo you have something you think the Honor 8 could have done better? Share in the comments below!\nThat being said, the Honor 8 is a great phone. Here are some of the things that the Honor 8 did great, and that I hope to see repeated in the next Honor phone:1. Design\nHonor blew this one out of the park. With an uber-cool design that matches even flagships like the Samsung Galaxy s7, the Honor 8 is the clear winner in the sub-$400 market for phones, with phones like the OnePlus 3 and the ZTE Axon 7 coming in second. [READ: http://forums.androidcentral.com/hon...r-opinion.html]2. Camera\nWith a camera setup that many suspect is the same as the one in the Huawei P9 (sans Leica branding), the Honor 8 has an incredible camera setup. While it may not have the software image processing of the Samsung Galaxy s7, the Honor 8 takes great pictures, and the dual camera setup even makes up for the lack of optical image stabilization.3. That Kirin Processor\nI have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Kirin processors in the US. HiSilicon (the semiconductor company that is owned by Huawei) makes really great chips, and the Kirin 950 that is in the Honor 8 is no exception. Early benchmarking shows that it has performance just under the Snapdragon 820, which is the processor in the Samsung Galaxy s7, a $700 flagship phone. Although Kirin processors have less developer support than Snapdragon chips, that is soon to change with Huawei releasing the kernel sources for Kirin chips, and an official tool for bootloader unlocks.4. NFC\nMany budget phones choose to leave out NFC, which puts their buyers out of luck with mobile payments. Thankfully, Honor has not made that mistake, and included an NFC chip that can be used with Android Pay, and can also write to NFC tags, making automation one step closer out of sci-fi and into reality. Android Beam, while still relatively obscure, is another NFC feature that I will be welcoming to Honor phones with open arms, following my traumatizing unsatisfactory experience with the Honor 5X and its lack of NFC.5. For you!\nWhat ways do you think Huawei truly triumphed? Let us know in the comments below!\nWhat do you wish Honor had done better? What did Honor do right? Voice your opinion in the comments below!\nAs always, feel free to ask me anything about the Honor 8, Honor phones, Huawei, or Android in general.\nHappy Androiding!\n-Lumi Valo\nP.S. You are probably wondering if I had slacked off and not included a fifth opinion simply to reduce work.

However, it is of no doubt that USB-C is the future, and hanging onto microUSB products will only make the process longer. \nThat being said, USB-C presents some interesting problems, because of it being touted as a \"universal\" port, which is not exactly true. Here's a look at some of the major problems having a so-called \"universal\" port can present, and how such problems could be remedied:Charging\nDifferent devices use different chargers, because they require different voltages, amperages, and watts of power to charge at an efficient rate (and also not explode or light on fire). Before, it was impossible to plug, let's say, a MacBook charger into a smartphone, simply because the two would not fit. But with the rise of USB-C, it becomes all too easy to absentmindedly plug your phone into your MacBook charger and leave it there all night, which may result in a rude awakening chemical battery explosion and house fire. One good way to avoid such situations is to truly make USB-C chargers universal, that is, have the charger detect the optimum voltage, wattage, and amperage that the device it is plugged in to needs, and adjust to it. However, this would require great coordination between major players in the industry, not to mention it would most likely result in a price increase on the already overpriced chargers.Data Transfer Disappointments\nUSB-C is widely praised for its high speeds for data transfer, but this not-always-true advertising can lead to some disappointing situations. A prime example is the Honor 8 itself, which has a USB-C port, but only USB 2.0 data transfer speeds. This can be misleading to many customers, who mistakenly associate USB-C with high speeds. The remedy for this? Simple: just like how USB 1.1 is just not used anymore, we have to wait for USB 2.0 to be slowly phased out.\nUSB-C does have its flaws, but it is definitely the direction that the industry Is heading in, and no matter which way you plug it in look at it, USB-C is going to work.\nWhat do you think of USB-C?

When a smartphone like the HTC One M8 comes out with legitimately high-quality speakers, it quickly gets washed away.

A \"good\" smartphone speaker is only mediocre in the grand scheme of things, so keeping that in mind, let's talk about the Honor 8's speaker quality.\nIt's surprisingly louder than I expected, but sound quality does really start to degrade when you crank it up to the higher levels. A tinny sound starts to emerge around the 75% mark, and 100% is very difficult to cringelessly listen to. However, it is a \"good\" smartphone speaker, when compared to, for example, the Honor 5X, LG G5 (we shall not mention the modular failure), and the Samsung Galaxy s7, all phones that have good speakers, but could have done it better.\nIt's 2016, and music is still going strong. OEMs have the capability to make great speakers, so why not include them? Five millimeter thin phones aren't even that comfortable to hold, anyway. Come on, Huawei, Samsung, Apple.
