If the guy that asked which is better picks Mate 9, good for him and I hope it delivers in every field he is hoping it will, all I said is in which Fields Oneplus 5 is CLEARLY better than Mate 9, and still Mate 9 would be a good for almost anyone, specially on a tight budget. peace, and I recommend you watch and read other sites and listen to others and don't get stuck on your believes alone ;)", "date": "05 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "phone is super fast.

", "date": "05 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "I'd rather say it's you who is insane :P \r\nFanboys are always the most insane.\n \r\nThe only thing that's really laughable here is that you only saw a few random YouTube videos on the Mate 9, and already think you know everything about it. Pathetic.\n \r\nScreen size from 5.5\" to 6\" is a *huge* difference. I've been using a S7 edge for a long time, a 5.5\" device, and when I switched to the Mate 9, the bigger screen size really had a huge impact, and I absolutely wouldn't want anything less than 6\" anymore.\n \r\nLikewise, the battery difference between the tiny 3300 mAh in the OP5 and the 4000 mAh in the Mate 9 is a *huge* difference. My S7 edge had a 3500 mAh battery, which is even bigger than the one in the OP5, but it was still very disappointing. As a heavy user, especially of Pokemon GO, the battery killer No. 1, it never lasted me through the day, and I always had to bring along a battery pack. When I switched to the Mate 9 with its bigger 4000 mAh battery, my battery pack suddenly became obsolete. I haven't needed it once anymore since.\n \r\nNow, the camera. I like to take a lot of photos, and the Leica camera has never disappointed me there, it always delivers a good performance. I've recently compared the photo quality with a friend who has a OP5, and the Leica camera in the Mate 9 generally takes better photos than the willy-nilly camera in the OP5, which e.g. has a noise problem, especially in low light. You can use the photo comparison tool on this site to see how the Leica camera in the Mate 9 kicks the OP5 camera deftly in the nuts, especially in Low Light conditions, where the OP5 camera follows the \"Bring the noise!\" motto. \r\nHere's a screenshot as proof:\n \n \r\nFinally, the expandable memory. As I said, I like to take a lot of photos, so the memory tends to quickly fill up. I wouldn't want to be forced to clean up the internal memory all the frigging time, that would be a major nuisance. Instead, I just swap out the SD card, and sort the photos whenever I find the time. I wouldn't want to miss this convenience, so I wouldn't ever touch a smartphone without SD card slot - where the only reason for the missing SD card slot is that the manufacturer wants to rip you off by forcing you to buy a version with more internal memory. Be it One Plus, Apple or whoever else uses that extortion practice.\n \r\nSo, to MH Asif: if you can live with a smaller, less comfortable screen, a tiny battery with poor battery life, a camera that follows the \"Bring the Noise!\" motto especially in Low Light and a non-expandable storage which you have to clean out all the time, and at the same time pay more for all these disadvantages... please, go ahead.", "date": "05 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "Ok let me start by saying I in NO WAY said Mate 9 is a bad phone, I don't have that phone but have watched a couple of videos of my prefer Reviewers on Youtube and I know what that phone is capable, I was talking to the guy that said Mate 9 is better than Oneplus because of a lot of laughable reasons IMO, the screen size is a matter a preference as you stated, but the difference between 6\" and 5.5\" isnt that big of a deal IMO to begin with, I come from a 5\" Phone so It took a while for me to get use to this phone and I think this is the perfect size for me at least, I woundt want a bigger phone in where using it single handed would become more difficult but of course that may change in time. \r\nabout he IR Blaster I know all the \"Goodies\" It offers, I come from HTC Family and my phone also had IR Blaster, Do I miss it? Yes! Is it a Deal breaker? not in a million years, I wouldnt brag about having it, but again that's me. \r\nAbout the Battery I myself consider a Heavy user, I use my phone for gaming alone for about 4 to 5 hours daily sometimes more sometimes less of course, the rest of the time is either in Standby Mode while I sleep or i'm in social media or talking to someone. but From the 24 hours a Day has, I use it for about 12 to 14 of those hours. and I still get a full day from a single Charge, Normally I Charge it at night around 8pm, while I'm finishing playing and about to go to sleep, I don't have to Charge it again until the very same time next day and I still have between 15 to 25% of battery left in most cases. \r\nI think the same as you regarding Storage, I would be more than happy with 64GB of ram on a phone, I got the 128GB version and 8GBs of Ram because I wanted to future proof it, I have TONS of videos, music and games and all the storage and currently using is about 45Gbs and I doubt I will ever fill this phone.\n \r\nI DO THINK the Oneplus 5 is Ahead of Mate 9, because is a year older, Snapdragon 835 is an amazing Chipset but that's my opinion and even if it is indeed ahead it wouldnt matter much because must phone lately come with the specs so that they dont lag easly.\n \r\nagain I do think Mate 9 is a good for whoever thinks it will fit their needs, in fact the beuty of Android is that! that you can choose between MANY brands, Colors, and Models and fit your needs and budget, while on Apple you stuck with that years model, I love that we have the option to pick from MANY brands and models, Before I bough this phone I did a LOT of research, I wanted something NEW(2017) and that would last me AT LEAST for 3 years and in a good price, I was interested in LG G6(Discarded this one because of the old specs despite being a 2017 Flagship), HTC U11 and Samsung S8 and I discarded those last 2 because of my budget, I risked going for a \"unknown\" Brand such a Oneplus but I did so after I watched and read a lot about the phone and I couldnt be happier with it. \n \r\nSo my advice to the guy that asked which is better is, dont listen to anyone that saids \"This phones sucks, XXX Phone is much better because of this and that\" I suggest you read a lil about the phones you find appealing to you and fit your needs and budget and you will decide pretty quick.", "date": "04 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "Hi...i had iPhone 5 since 2 years.but i want to upgrade my phone...so i am confused between iPhone 6s and one plus 5.which one is better??", "date": "04 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "Kanon, I read your entire thread and I would like to share my insight as well on both options under discussion.\n \r\nI have been using Mate 9 for the past 10 months now. I am one of those people who like to stay up to date with every new model that gets launched in the market and that claims to provide something ahead of other option available to a customer. Since I have purchased Mate 9, I believe this investment so far has proved to be one of the best. We have some new giants in the market now of Samsung but not for once I considered switching to any device.\n \r\nIt's a competitive market and each company strives to stay ahead of their competitors by introducing one or more unique features, which most of the times are not even useful, but just a symbol of attraction for the customers. recent examples would be Iris scanner or face recognition features. Honestly, does their absence in our phones make any difference ?\n \r\nI believe, those features in a phone stand out that can be incorporated as a part of our normal routine. You kind of mocked the preference of IR blaster in a phone. Well, this is a very handy feature for a lot of reasons. It provides the user with an option in case the actual devices for connectivity are not available. It's a very practical feature of a phone but nonetheless its usage is not among a bigger percentage but having said that, it cannot be denied that it does provide comfort in a lot many ways. Jack of all trades kind of device.\n \r\nMate 9's 4000 mAh battery does provide a good talk time and stand by too. I charge my phone once a day or sometimes I charge it the next day. I use Data/WiFi throughout the day and it still provides me hassle free charge. Fast charge is one among the noticeable features of high range phones but even then every phone does not provide it the way it claims. This phone too takes 75 mins to give a full charge. I have never for once faced any heat up on this phone while on charge.\n \r\nScreen size is again a matter of choice and preference, like I am not comfortable with smaller screens.\n \r\nCamera Quality: this is again a feature almost everyone looks up to. Everyone brand uses a different lens, changes the aperture options, and the availability of pro feature. Using a camera in itself a skill and one needs to know how he can play with ISO, saturation, modes etc. And I think every mobile phone company portrays that it has provided best camera features one could look for.\n \r\nOneplus is undoubtedly a very solid brand and it's the pioneer of developing a device that was low in price but was no less than any flagship device on the market. I used Oneplus One for almost 2 years. I switched to 3T and I could not stand it for more than 02 days as it was a complete disappointment. \n \r\nOneplus 5 bags in 8GB RAM with 128 GB of internal storage. Expanded RAM, sounds great but 128 GB storage ? I think 64 GB is good enough especially if you are in a habit to regularly clean your phone's cache and other Junk and also don't hoard unnecessary files on your phone.\n \r\nIn nutshell, it all comes down to one's preference and likeness. There is no single phone on the market which can be called to be a dream come true sort of device. If one phone has 02 good features then it might be lacking in 01 or 02 more. There's very tough competition in the market and every company is striving to attract as much market share as possible. Quality is being compromised in one way or the other.\n \r\nBeing a user of Mate 9, I can confidently say that it is a very good investment because of the features that it provides. Performance quality is only developing and not going down no matter how many applications are installed or how heavy the usage is. No lag for once up til date. Oneplus 5 has its own merits but it by no means stay ahead of Mate 9. But, yes, only when it comes to price range.\n\n", "date": "04 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "I m confused between lg g6 and this.which one is better.lg g6 having much more features as compare to this one.", "date": "04 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "Nice phone suparv performance nice battery backup good charging", "date": "04 Oct 2017"}, {"text": "Battery..

With EIS you get way faster focus time and the images don't look as wabbly as with OIS. \r\nThe main advantage of OIS is that is doesn't need to crop the images nor do any editing while recording, the hardware does it for you. \r\nFor me, EIS on the oneplus 5 is far more stable than OIS. i got a nexus 5 and OIS was wobbling it felt weird.

The Recent update included eis for 4k video recording. The usp is the dual camera which is good enough for the price range , the dual cam works similar to tech in iPhone 7 plus i.e. wide-angle and telephoto.The images on primary cameras is sharp and colors reproduction is good .sometimes, you need to adjust the exposure using the buitin editor to fix the image. The promode is excellent with lot of features and one should explore it completely before using it. Remember, light is the key for any good photography hence you can take awesome shots when you ensure the lighting is proper . Low light photography is decent enough and one should not expect similar to dslr due to iso limitations on the smartphone . Thanks front cam is great for selfies , even though there is no front flash, the screen acts as flash during low light conditions and the selfies are great in low light as well. The phone doesn't heat up with contious usage and battery backup is more than a day with typical/normal usage . Dash charging is one awesome feature which quick charges the phone .unlike other quick chargers , the phone or the charger doesn't get heated up during charging.

It's stylus, large screen and big battery helped me a lot in various creative things I did for   being online business we had to use several applications and tools to monitor the performance of website and a lot of day to day designing stuff for ads and marketing. I waited a lot for Note7 refurbished version for almost 6 months. The current battery is my 4th original Samsung battery. Everytime I replace the battery it gives a new avatar to it.\n \r\nAfter a long wait when I came to know the price of Note8 is going to be somewhere around 70k and that too after waiting almost a month after it's launch I prepared myself for my first One Plus Mobile.\n \r\nI was sure I needed more RAM for multi tasking and openening several apps simultaneously. So I went with 8GB model. Thanks to Amazon exchange which got me discounted at 34k against a spare Moto. One more advantage I got was for cash back of 2k with Axis Bank which I may get in around November.\n \r\nThe experience of shifting to a new Brand is indeed dicy. It is a risk. \r\nBut believe me after using it for almost a week with rigorous usage and long hours of screen time for multiple apps, I feel I don't need a laptop now. I mean wow. No matter how many apps I open in background the swapping is like bread and butter. Thanks to Snapdragon series 8 processor.\n \r\nOnePlus has earned the trust of performance at Rock bottom prices. Had this configuration under Samsung Brand it would have been a minimum of 75k price tag.\n \r\nLiterally I can have 2 Oneplus 5 - 8GB at the price of Note 8. What's better than that. And there is hardly anything like stylus and 9:18.5 ratio screen size which is not there in Oneplus 5 which is not that needful at that this price. Even Note8 has lesser RAM than this. The built quality is at par.\n \r\nThe camera quality is considerably good. The dual camera is capable enough of replacing the SLR camera in good day light with Portrait Mode. Battery is good enough to handle the full day with GPS and Bluetooth enabled for any wearable device.\n \r\nBest part - Combination of Processor + RAM + Oxygen OS\n \r\nLoved : the Black Theme with Blue Icons\n \r\nThe screen looks like super technologically sound device when turning to Black Theme. After several years under boring Touch Wiz of Samsung it gives a good feeling with such changes in theme. I know change always gives fantacy initially but that's why I am writing this review after intense use and under normal mood conditions. Nothing excited or over exaggeration.\n \r\nThese features if provided at 50k is not worth. But yes when you get lucky enough to get them all at 32k it's jackpot.\n \r\nI remember I bought my Note 4 at 57k in January 2015 which was equivalent to the price of bike I drove.\n \r\nOverall - to conclude in one line. It's worth at this price specially if you are into creative profile using multiple things else to with 6GB version.

Secondly, when you restart OP5 the fingerprint scanner won't recognize your finger and you have to unlock using pin or pattern but once done the fingerprint scanner will work perfectly..It is more of a bug which can be fixed with the updates. \r\nSo, I conclude if you want value for money phone with a price tag which is affordable as on 13th Sept 2017 Go for OP5 or else if you have deep pockets then go for Samsung S8 or even Note 8 both are really good options &#128077; \r\nI have noticed \r\nNo lag \r\nNo hang \r\nNo phone heating problems \r\nDash charger works well \r\nBattery lasts up to 1 full day", "date": "14 Sep 2017"}, {"text": "Great phone with great features.

To be honest, I have given a thought. Why you ask??. Camera and Display. I had it for a year and I have loved taking pictures and videos from it. The rear camera is an important aspect for me when I'm out, looking for a phone. So after making up my mind, I finally decide to go for OnePlus 5. So here's my quick review after 2 weeks of usage.\n \r\nPerformance:- \r\nNot diving into the details. I bought the 6GB/64GB variant as I think this would be more than enough. But combined with Snapdragon latest processor this phone is SNAPPY!!!. And to be honest, it's too quick sometimes. Thanks to latest Android Nougat and Oxygen OS on top of it, any app, you name it, will open in a flash. There are few apps out there which have some compatibility issues, which I think is specific to this model only(generic apps like VLC player), and I'm hoping fix might be on the way. Otherwise, usage wise, its Fluid!!.\n \r\nDesign & Display \r\nThe design is again great(though I would prefer if OP can come with their unique blueprints), though the metal on the back makes it quite slippery, which makes buying a case necessary. Coming to the display, I have to compare it with Nexus 6P, and this one is just incredible. 6P is 2K display and while this one is 1080p but thanks to the latest Gorilla Glass and LED panel, the display is crisp, sharp and easy on the eyes. You also have 3 color modes option to choose for better viewing as per your requirement. Again, a plus point here. Apart from this, you have Night Mode and Reading Mode which changes the temperature of the screen to the warm side so that you can read or use the phone for long hours.\n \r\nSpeaking of long hours....Battery : \r\nI'm not a battery management expert and since this is a new phone, it is supposed to give me a good charge, which it is. Generally, with one single charge, I can last this for a day and a half and still 20-30% juice left on it. Kudos! for that. Dash Charger with 4A output is definitely something that we have to see with other phones, as because of this, phone charges completely hardly in 30-45 mins when I charge it from 15 to 90%. I use my phone every now n then, so charging with such a battery life is actually appreciated.\n \r\nCamera : \r\nAgain, will not get into the details of what is already available out there. But Camera on this phone performs. I have uploaded some pictures taken with several options provided in default camera app. For a 4K sample, you can check this link,   . When you're using a product like Nexus 6P, your expectation is bound to be high. And it is good, it is not great(not yet), but it is good. And with the latest updates from OnePlus, it is just getting better and better. Depth effect definitely works and focuses the subject clearly with a clear difference between the subject and the background. Daylight shots are purely excellent with or without HDR and exposure levels at par. It is the selfie camera which takes pictures where exposure is not at all in place and looks like the front camera is trying too hard to make things look bright and heavenly. Another is low light pictures which tend to lose details and is too grainy, but then with few tweaks and update, I can manage. Dual Led Flash works well and keeps the scene bright enough to capture every detail in a frame.\n \r\nValue for Money?? Definitely!! Just compare and see how many SD 835 SoC phones are available in the market with such specs and how much would they cost you. Apart from that, this device boasts quality from the very first grip and when you start using it from the very first day. You get a premium built device with hardware and software that should easily cover you for next 3 years within 30-40K price bracket.\n \r\nI have already purchased additional year warranty and a cover for my satisfaction. I'm hoping the after sales service will be as good and promising as the product itself as that is also a deal breaker for many of us. Hopefully it may not disappoint me just like what Nexus 6P has done and hopefully, I will settle with this one for a longer period and\n \r\nBut then again, my sub-conscious ask this pertinent question. Should I settle with it?? I think you might have the answer. \r\nRead less", "date": "04 Sep 2017"}, {"text": "Forget buying the Oneplus 5, because Oneplus 5T will come with IP68 water and dust proof protection we've been all asking for.

Thank You.", "date": "30 Aug 2017"}, {"text": "My review of the OnePlus 5 after 2 weeks of usage:\n \r\nDesign \r\nFeels premium, sleek & light in hands. The rear of the phone looks similar to Iphone 7+ but feels very much different after usage. The front is very much similar to the OP3 & OP3T. All of the above wont make much of a difference if used with a back case as majority of users do.\n \r\nDisplay \r\nFull HD 1080p display gets the job done. Similar to its predecessors & nothing unique. Battery efficient for sure. Auto brightness seems to be aggressive keeping the screen brightness dim in indoors & has to be adjusted manually time to time. Can be fixed with a software update. LED notification light is on the softer side. It is hardly visible in well lit areas & needs to be looked into to find the LED pulsing... it can be annoying at times.\n \r\nSound \r\nThe single mono firing speaker at the bottom is loud enough & is at par in audio quality with other flagships. Calls via speaker are loud & clear. Speaker grill placement might seem to be a bit awkward though if you have used front firing or stereo speaker setup before. I found the audio being muffled when using the device with both hands as my palm accidentally covered the speaker grill quite often. Audio output from the 3.5mm jack is perfect.\n \r\nPerformance \r\nSnapdragon 835 coupled with 6/8gb RAM is blazing fast. Such stellar internals might not be required at the moment but it makes the phone future proof & is an added bonus at the given price. Real life performance is buttery smooth... games, heavy apps, multi tasking, fingerprint scanner can easily outperform other flagship devices without showing any signs of heat. Only felt the camera area slightly warm while recording videos at 4K for longer duration.\n \r\nBattery \r\n3300MaH battery might sound small in numbers but can easily last for a day for the not so heavy users. Heavy users with a 100% charge by 8am in the morning with 15-20 calls a day, regular follow ups on whatsapp, facebook, twitter, instagram, a bit of gaming, photography, youtube videos, music & so on might end up charging the phone again in the evening by 6-7pm which again is taken well care of by the magical dash charging. Put it on charge during your break time with a 15-20% battery & boom! You will be amazed to see its already 60-70% in roughly 15-20minutes. The only wait u will realize while charging is after it crosses 80% where it takes about an hour or so to reach the 100% mark if started from 0-5%.\n \r\nCamera \r\nThe Dual camera setup is a welcome addition. Regular shots are fine & detailed in well lit conditions. Shots in indoor lighting are also above average but shots taken in low lighting is where you might require sturdy hands or a tripod to get a decent result. The portrait mode clicks perfect DSLR type images most of the time in bright conditions with a limitation of the subject being in 0.3-2metres range from the lens. Portrait mode in indoor lighting or low lighting situation struggles with noise in the images. Pro mode gives you manual controls & can click regular as well as RAW images for post production. Slow motion & Time lapse video also give a decent result in well lit conditions. Video recording at 4k after the update is smooth & is comparable to that of other flagships with OIS but at the cost of slight loss in quality. Front 16MP camera gives detailed images in bright outdoors as well as good image quality indoors. Video quality also from the same is vlogging good & captures detailed videos with clean audio in the open. Would suggest to check a detailed camera review on youtube for samples & a better perspective.\n \r\nSoftware \r\nOxygen OS skin over the Nougat OS is optimized to best suit the OP5 internals. Works without a glitch & the customization options will keep new users charmed for a while. Overall the software feels light on the phone without any hang ups or hiccups whatsoever. Regular OTA updates assure that the company is always working in the background for customer support by addressing issues immediately.\n \r\nConclusion\n \r\nPros: \r\nDesign - Gives a satisfactory feel in the hand with its build & design. \r\nDisplay - Full HD display will get the job done for most of its users. \r\nSound - Output is audible in most of the situations. \r\nPerformance - Can be titled as the \"Fastest Android Phone\" till date. \r\nBattery - Will not give up on you when most needed. Dash charging is a wonder. \r\nCamera - Excellent in bright conditions. Portrait mode will keep you clicking. \r\nSoftware - Oxygen OS with its customization is just perfect. \r\nCall Quality - Good in both to & from ends. \r\nStorage - 64Gb or 128Gb depends totally on user preference.\n \r\nCons: \r\nDesign - Slippery at times but a back cover or case can help. \r\nDisplay - Quad HD display with a better screen to body ratio would have been a plus. Auto brightness keeps screen dim in indoors & LED notification light is on the softer side.   \r\nSound - Stereo sound setup would have been a flagship killer quality. \r\nPerformance - No complaints. Can be improved with software updates \r\nBattery - Bigger battery could clear a full day usage even for the heavy users. \r\nCamera - There is scope for improvement as it doesn't deliver what it promised. \r\nSoftware - More gestures maybe.  \r\nCall Quality - Haven't experienced any issues yet. \r\nStorage - Expandable memory with a hybrid sim tray would be excellent. \r\nPrice - 128gb/8gb variant should have been selling for the price of 64gb/6gb variant to be a true flagship killer & the 64gb/6gb at a price slightly higher than the OP3T\n\n \r\nAbove are my personal opinion about the OP5 after more than 2 weeks of usage now...

I want to publish it to prevent others who want to buy from OnePlus.\n \r\nOn 28th of June I ordered two items: OnePlus 5 Midnight Black and OnePlus 5 Silicone Protective Case (Black) from the official web site(   ). On the 4th of July I received the package and opened it in the presence of my colleagues, who witnessed the fact that they didn\u00c2\u0092t send the products that I had ordered and paid for.  \r\nFirstly, I noticed that the phone case that I had ordered was not in the package so I opened a claim tag. When I set up the phone and looked over the specifications I noticed that I received another version of the phone and not the one I ordered and paid for. I ordered a Midnight Black 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage and instead I received Slate Gray 6GB RAM + 64GB Storage. I opened once more a new claim tag for this but the support operator from OnePlus closed the two claims and made only one tag. I attached pictures of the entire package and it\u00c2\u0092s content, pictures that prove that the version of the phone that was in the case was different from the one that was shown on the box. Also, the IMEI series that was written on the box that contained the phone, was different from the IMEI series that was written on the phone that was in the box.  \r\nTo resume, not only did I pay for a phone case that was not in the delivered package, but I also paid for a different version of the phone that I ordered.  \r\nI gave them three ways of resolving this matter:  \r\n1) send the courier to pick up the mistaken package and after that send me the right products that I ordered in the first place, which are: Midnight Black 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage + OnePlus 5 Silicone Protective Case (Black)  \r\n2) A second option is to send the courier to pick up the mistaken package and refund me the full amount of money that I paid (The whole amount paid by me, not what it cost me what I actually received)  \r\n3) The third option would be to send me the amount of money that represents the difference between the price of Midnight Black 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage + OnePlus 5 Silicone Protective Case (Black) and the price of Slate Gray 6GB RAM + 64GB Storage and give me warranty certificate for Slate Gray 6GB RAM + 64GB Storage.  \r\nThe answer after their first investigation was: \" \r\nCody here again to take over. Thank you for your patience. I've gotten feedback from our headquarters regarding evaluation. I regret to say that the case has been declined. They were able to conclude that there were no discrepancies during the delivery period as well as the packing from our warehouse.\n \r\nI hope you understand that we take the steps to ensure the validity and integrity of our investigation hence the set number of days for the investigation as well as getting this forwarded to our headquarters to make extra sure.\"\n \r\nAfter daily discussions with people from support they have escalated the case to a specialist and since July 15, no one answers the ticket. I called for support, I chatted with them almost daily. Everyone tells me the same clich\u00e9: to wait 24-48 hours until I get an answer.

However, Sammy intentionally builds glass so you can replace their screens more often. I had a Note 5 and it fell down from my hand (even though it had a very tough hard case) and it didn\u00c2\u0092t break at all but the internals were gone. I had to change the LCD completely costing me $220. I had to do that because I needed the data in it. Then just one week later fell down again and it didn\u00c2\u0092t break at all but the internal LCD is gone. What is this crapy hardware? I had an iPhone and it fell down multiple times and it never break. From experience Samsung and Sony Xperia are worst in terms of durability (even though the looks appealing) \r\n-\tSoftware: for A Samsung phone to be functioning well it needs to have a minimum of 4 GB RAM and above 2.5 Ghz processor; Otherwise it lags like shit. I used Note 5 and its ok but not perfect. I then switched to A7 2017 and it lags like the old days. Sammy phones are full of crappy shit that are not useful for the overall folks that\u00c2\u0092s why they removed some of the bloatware in the last iterations.\n \r\nI just love the Note Series and there is no competition at all in that category and that\u00c2\u0092s why I\u00c2\u0092m waiting for the Note 8. For all those folks, if you have an S8, S6,S7 better get yourself a good warranty before you buy the phone so at least when it fell down you can recover the cost otherwise put a brick military case on it.

Have you got any idea why all the big games debut in iPhone and come to android very late? iPhones and games go hand in hand. Not only games but all apps perform better in iPhones, you accept it or not, that's the fact. I can confirm that being an iPhone 6s and Galaxy S6E user. Yes battery gets down very fast if we play gfx intense games but they neither lag or stutter during game play nor show any delay in opening those games. Even GSMA accepts apps and games perform better in iPhones. And now talking about prices: It costs Samsung approximately 307$ to manufacture S8 with a new curved qhd display, SD835/Exynos, ISOCELL camera and all other bits and pieces and OP5's manufacturing costs will be lesser than that considering all the cost cutting it took by reusing 3T's screen(which still costs less to manufacture compared to Samsung's curved screens)  and sub par camera, obviously less R&D cost involved in copying an iPhone, we will put that figure at $230/240. And Samsung is a very big company which has a very large R&D department to go with manufacturing business. So if they sell phone for 307$ who will pay all those who worked at factory and R&D? In that case OnePlus should also sell you at the said price of $240. Then why they are selling at 500-550$? Prices of S8 and iPhones are exorbitant accepted but thing is your OnePlus is also reaching that price range slowly with $550 8gb OP5.

When scrolling through web pages and apps, it appears to be a kind of distortion of the content. As reported by XDA Developers, a manufacturer's design decision might be responsible for this effect.\n \r\nThe OnePlus 5 has the same display as the OnePlus 3T. So how can it be that the scrolling with the newer and even more powerful smartphone comes to the described presentation error, which you can also see in the video under this article? According to the report, there is quite a difference between the two smartphone screens: one of them is upside down.\n \r\nNo update or exchange planned\n \r\nAccording to the developer, the firmware of the OnePlus 5 contains a code line that is responsible for turning the contents of the display 180 degrees. This is obviously necessary because OnePlus has installed the \"wrong\" screen. As a result, the OnePlus 5 reappears as any other smartphone. However, a side-effect of the first twisted and then corrected alignment appears to be the unsightly display error during scrolling. According to XDA Developers, this effect could even be simulated with other smartphones, especially with OLED devices. For this, only the automatic alignment should be activated and the corresponding smartphone turned upside down.\n \r\nLooking at the internal design of the OnePlus 5, OnePlus makes the impression that OnePlus has rotated the screen to provide the camera sensor of the dual camera. The is now approximately where the OnePlus 3T still the display controller can be found. As the manufacturer said recently, users should not expect a software fix for the problem, or assume that devices with this effect would be exchanged by OnePlus because it is a \"natural behavior\".\n \r\n 01 July 2017 - 12:00\n \r\nIncredible but true. OnePlus 5 integrates the display in reverse in its new flagship OnePlus 5. Off Probably not! In our Review, the OnePlus 5 unfortunately so far not very well and this will probably not change so fast. So far, we had pushed the \"scroll bug\" (jelly effect and stutter) to a little optimized software and hoped that OnePlus would get the handle in the coming weeks under control. Pete Lau said just a few days ago that this was completely normal and would not claim a return or guarantee claim. But as it turns out, the error is not directly in the software optimization, but in the production of the hardware itself.\n\n\n \r\nAccording to reports, the firmware of the OnePlus 5 contains a code that ensures that the screen is rotated by 180 \u00b0. But why would you want to display the screen around the wrong way? You do not want, because as written above, the entire display is installed upside down and somehow the user must be able to perceive the content then also \"correctly\" around.\n \r\nBut why is one building a display in a wrong way? Well, it seems probably as if OnePlus contrary to its own statements but a massive space problem, although the design and the location of the dual cameras that the iPhone 7 had modeled - which should be particularly space-saving. Because of this lack of space OnePlus was probably forced to this rather unorthodox measure.\n \r\nA genius kingdom? Not at all! For now the software must actually bring the upside down image in the correct orientation. And this consumes computing capacity, which in turn provides a fraction of the delay and possibly also the \"jelly effect\" during rapid scrolling.\n \r\nIt is also unlikely that OnePlus will change this type of production with its new flagship. For this, a corresponding re-design would be necessary, or the development of a new display, which is right around the place. Currently one recycles the display of the OnePlus 3T again. Consequently, only our conclusion from the review underlines. Finger away and choose an alternative. These are enough in the price range of 500-600 \u00c2\u0080 (and even under). Owners of a OnePlus 5 should now quickly decide whether to use their revocation right. Who knows what's coming?\n \r\nOne thing is certain. The OnePlus 5 is not yet the yellow of the egg and this year should not be another manufacturer completely next to it, then the OnePlus 5 possibly the flop of the year 2017.

I am sure some new player will come out with equally great specs at $200 cheaper - thus driving another round of lower priced solid phones. But not today.\n \r\nWe will see how these perform and I will see if this becomes Neo or I need to move along. Unfortunately, we (someone point me?) have very little unlocked phones sold in Canada with Canadian warranties (/offering extended warranties) Apple and Samsung (I think at their store) aside. Many unlocked are \"refurb\" junk (someone else's problems never figured out) or \"at your own risk - may not work with your provider\" etc.  Costco sells some - and I keep looking for new offerings - nothing has turned my crank - and they offer no extra warranty surprisingly (their tablets do).
