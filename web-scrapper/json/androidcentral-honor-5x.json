If you want to further reduce power consumption and extend battery life, the following contents will be useful to you.\n- Screen is the NO.1 power consuming factor, and it's possible to reduce screen power consumption. Under Display, deactivate Auto-rotate screen to reduce the use of gravity sensor. At the same time, shorten the time for Sleep when there is no operation, and change Brightness to Automatic brightness will also reduce power consumption.\n- Protected apps and automatic startup upon being powered on can be set up according to your need and habit. Of course, more power will be saved if you have fewer protected apps.\nHope that helps you guys save on battery life!

The Google keyboard feels more responsive with the letter popups having no delay or stutter as would occasionally happen on 5.1.\nApp switching is notably faster, but is still wanting when compared to more capable hardware.\nNotifications so far seem to be working better, but there's still layout issues. Annoyed to see that Google Maps' navigation notification doesn't expand resulting in overlapping text.\nBluetooth Audio - Crossing my fingers, but so far BT audio playback was great in my car this morning. On 5.1, I encountered occassional skips and stutters with BT playback that other phones didn't.\nWaze Weirdness - When launching Waze for the first time post update, it wasn't finding my location. Just to confirm GPS functionality, I launched GPS Status, which the OS then prompted for location access. This clued me in that Waze was likely a permission issue. I ended up manually enabling the location permission for Waze, which fixed the issue. Not sure if unique to my install, but something to watch out for.\nSo far this update is a welcome improvement.

Tektide\u2019s Invisible Armor for the Honor 5X does just that. \nThe Invisible Armor case is extremely thin and quite light. The added bulk is very minimal and bulk-wise, holding the device feels like there\u2019s no case on at all - but it\u2019s there. The case adds some grip to the sides though the rear may still feel slick to some. Definitely not as slick as the regular back of the Honor 5X though. \nThe power button and volume rocker are easy to find and I had no problems pressing the buttons down. I haven\u2019t missed a press yet. \nDown at the bottom are cutouts for speaker, micro USB port, and mic. Up top, there are cutouts for the noise canceling mic and 3.5mm audio port. The case does not impede sound quality and the micro USB cutout is large enough where I had no issues plugging in any of my micro USB cables. Depending on the size of your 3.5mm connector though, you may have issues plugging them into the top of your Honor 5X with this case on. I had no issues with the Motorola and SOL Republic headsets I tested with.\nOn the back, there are cutouts for the camera, camera flash, and fingerprint sensor. All three are large enough to not have an impact - even the camera flash cutout. An added benefit of using a case is that the camera hump no longer hits the surface when you set the device down.\nAll in all, a solid, slim case that works well the Honor 5X to keep your phone protected while still showing off it\u2019s colors. \nBuy it here from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...cUvbUpU5241938", "time": "06-27-2016 02:49 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5241988", "text": "Wow, that one does a much better job at not adding bulk than many clear cases I've seen.

This is the variant with 2 GB of RAM (there\u2019s a 3 GB version, but not sure if that\u2019s available in the US) and 16 GB of internal storage, running 5.1.1. I\u2019m using it SIM-free, but did test out some calls using Hangouts Dialer. I'm also using it without a microSD card.The GoodBuild: This is one of the first things you\u2019ll see and feel, and it\u2019d be quite impressive for a $399 phone, despite the actual $199 price tag. The brushed metal has a nice texture, and is somehow less slippery than that on the Nexus 6P. Seams are tight, and there\u2019s no hint of squeaking or flexing anywhere. The whole thing feels nice and solid, and yet quite light.Screen: Viewing angles are good, and the brightness range is decent. The Auto Brightness adjustment works better than on the ZenFone 2 (which never gets dark enough at night).Speaker: The mono speaker is loud--almost too loud. I wish the lowest volume setting was just a bit lower, in case I wanted to listen to something briefly in a quiet room without disturbing anyone else.Battery: Battery life is impressive, due in part to Huawei\u2019s very aggressive RAM management (see below). But it\u2019s difficult to give real-world stats, since I have no SIM installed, and therefore the phone is always on Airplane Mode (which tends to conserve battery).Fingerprint sensor: Excellent performance--on par with its cousin on the Nexus 6P. Unlock is fast, and it rarely fails to recognize my fingerprint (unless I\u2019m touching it at an odd angle).Minimal bloat: Fortunately, there isn\u2019t much Huawei bloatware. There are a few preinstalled apps that can be uninstalled (like Facebook), and I could also Disable the stock Notepad and Email apps. There are a few small feature apps like a Magnifier (that essentially uses the camera in macro mode) and a Mirror. 10.51 GB are available to the user on this 16 GB phone, which is pretty standard.The MehEMUI: I actually thought I\u2019d hate Huawei's custom launcher more, but it\u2019s not as bad as I was expecting, and you can always install a 3rd party launcher anyway. Problems with EMUI include:No App Drawer, in keeping with its iOS inspiration. I like App Drawers, because I like to customize my homescreen the way I want it to look. I don\u2019t want to create a \u201cJunk\u201d or \u201cUseless\u201d folder just to hold all of the stuff I never need to look at (and can\u2019t disable).Weirdly shaped icons. The UI tries to make all icons look squares with rounded edges, which can lead to some icons (like the Gmail one) look more like it has a spare tire.Homescreen folders don\u2019t display enough icons at a time--only nine per screen, which is kind of annoying considering that since there\u2019s no App Drawer, you\u2019ll probably have lots of apps in some folders.Strange placement of menu buttons in system settings/apps--they\u2019re along the bottom, rather than at the upper right (as you\u2019d expect with Material Design). The inconsistency can be annoying.Performance: A mixed bag. When waking the phone up in the morning and turning on wi-fi, things can be pretty pokey as services sync with the cloud (and also as apps start up--see below). Afterwards, it settles down, but system animations and transitions can still be a little stuttery. On the other hand, I had no problems playing games like Goat Simulator, Asphalt Nitro, or Star Wars Pinball.I\u2019m always using the phone in Normal Mode under the Power Saving Menu. There are \u201cSmart\u201d and \u201cUltra\u201d Power Saving Modes, but I\u2019ve read that even the Smart mode leads to a significant performance hit.The Protected Apps option may also impact performance. On this phone, apps by default get closed out of RAM by the system when the screen is off, to prevent them from waking the phone or accessing the web while the phone is idle. Although this does help save some battery, it can also lead to some sluggishness right after waking the phone (as apps are restarted), and it can also potentially close apps that should be persisting in the background (like a music app).Preinstalled screen protector: For those who really want to use a screen protector, it\u2019s nice that it comes preinstalled. But I don\u2019t like them, since they tend to dull the screen vividness, as well as decrease the touch sensitivity (and Huawei\u2019s is no exception). In addition, this screen protector really builds up skin oil, which doesn\u2019t come off that easily with a microfiber cloth. Fortunately, the screen protector is easy to take off.Equalizer: There are EQ presets available (tested in Google Play Music), but you can\u2019t customize your own EQ setting.Button placement: The Volume and Power buttons are on the right side of the phone, but the Power button is below the Volume buttons--the reverse of most other phones in the US. I found myself more than once accidentally turning the screen off instead of adjusting the volume.The BadVery slow Google sync: For unclear reasons, many (if not all) Google apps seem to take much longer than usual to sync with the cloud. This is most glaringly obvious when using the Google Calendar app (not the stock Calendar)--when I switch between the several calendars I have in my account, the displayed events don\u2019t change until I tap Menu>Refresh. On all other devices, the events change immediately after switching calendars, which is much more convenient when having to toggle quickly between them. I\u2019ve checked to make sure background data isn\u2019t restricted, and that the app is \u201cProtected\u201d by the system (see above).Poor camera performance: This is where the ASUS ZenFone 2 (which is one of the main competitors at this price point) is far superior. Indoor photos taken by the 5X were grainy and fuzzy, even during the daytime. Look at the photo of the piano--the print on the Brahms book is blurry, even though the ambient light was normal, and the camera was set to Auto Flash (the flash didn\u2019t go off).\nOverall, I would say that the Honor 5X is an impressive value, combining quality build and components with excellent features not normally seen in a phone of this price. EMUI takes some getting used to, but it\u2019s not a dealbreaker by any stretch. However, considering how important the camera has become to most users, the poor photo quality might give you pause.", "time": "02-02-2016 05:08 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4980392", "text": "Nice review, thanks.

This is a few days before the USA launch. If an update is pushed on or before the launch date then I will update the review. However, I wanted to put this out there in case there are people who are still deciding. Also, this was tested on wifi only, i plan to test it on cellular next week and will update my findings then. Honor 5X reviewPros: \n-Build quality\n-Top notch fingerprint scanner\n-Great battery life\n-ScreenCons: \n-Lots of random slowness\n-Very aggressive and overbearing power management by default\n-Software experience is different than what most USA smartphone users are used toHardware / Build / External Body: \nHonor states that it has a metallic body. Overall the 5X feels great in the hand and a better build quality and feel than my Moto G, Moto E, and Asus Zenphone 2. However, I believe that the top and the bottom are plastic, which is probably to house the various antennas. While some minor plastic isn\u2019t really a big deal, I am not sure why they chose to use a dotted finish on the top and the bottom, instead of continuing the brushed type finish on the back. Additionally, there are 5 different finishes on the device \u2013 the main portion of the back which is brushed aluminum, the top and bottom of the back, which is a dotted finish; the sides, which has a sanded finish; the chamfered connection between the back and the sides, which has what looks to be machined finish, similar to the Note 4; and the portion right under the screen which has a glossy finish. Of note, I have the same problem that I had on my Note 4, which is that the chamfered portion scratches easily. These are somewhat minor points, and the 5X is really good in terms of build quality for the price point, but it is a noticeable step below the iPhone and S6/Note 5 which uses a more uniform look throughout, which is fine because those devices cost much more.\nGoing beyond the materials, the bottom has a uniform grilles on both sides which is aesthetically pleasing, one for the speaker, and one for the microphone. The back has the camera and flash as well as the fingerprint scanner. The left side has two slots for the micro sim + SD card and a nano sim slot. The top has a headphone jack and a mic hole.\nThe power and volume buttons are on the right side, and they have a good grooved texture and feel to them. They also require a moderate amount of force to press, so it shouldn\u2019t accidentally turn on in your pocket. Of note, Honor chose to put the volume buttons on top, and the power buttons down on the side, which is different than some other Android devices like the Nexii and Moto series. Display: \nThe display is a 1080p 5.5\u201d IPS LCD screen which is quite excellent for the price point. Way better than the Zenphone 2, and not far in quality from my Note 5 (which is a compliment). As with most IPS screens, the viewing angles are great. Brightness is good enough for usage outdoors in direct sunlight. Not as bright as the Note 5, but good enough. One nice thing is that it allows for adjustments to auto brightness, which is a very nice feature. The screen doesn\u2019t get as dark as I would like at night, however, you can use a third party brightness app or use a screen filtering app if you need it darker. \nThe screen does lack an oleophobic coating, so there will be fingerprints galore. There is a pre-installed plastic screen protector which also gets fingerprints galore. You can easily buy a screen protector to resolve this problem, so I am not docking Honor for this since I always get screen protectors anyways. There are tempered glass screen protectors out there which go almost edge to edge, and with a case, you will barely notice that the screen protector is even there. Performance and Battery Life: \nHonor promises, an \u201cIncredible 8 core high performance processor with 2 GB RAM for a smooth, responsive user experience.\u201d\nWhile they deliver on the 8 core processor and 2 GB RAM, the \u201chigh performance\u201d and \u201csmooth responsive user experience\u201d is debatable.\nIf the 5X is the only device you use, then it will probably be fine. However, if you have used multiple devices, then it will become apparent that the Honor 5X has a lot of random minor slowness, sometimes even when scrolling between home screens. It comes with the Power Saving mode set to \u201cSmart\u201d by default, and that was really laggy. For this review, I changed the Power Saving Mode to \u201cNormal\u201d which would maximize performance. The 5X has a Snapdragon 615 which is an octa-core a53 chip. I have a ZTE Zmax2 (which is $80 as of today, 1/28/16 on Best Buy and Walmart) which seems to perform slightly better than the 5x, and which has a Snapdragon 410 quad core A53. Granted the Zmax2 does have a 720p screen so that might be part of the problem. Looking in the $200 price range, the Zenphone 2 has quite good performance, substantially better than the 5X. The other problem could be that Honor tuned the kernel more towards battery life, which is quite excellent for the price range. Honor claims over a full day of heavy use, but doesn\u2019t define heavy usage. Some days, I have used around 15 hours SOT, and even with straight SOT, I could probably get 9-10 hours max. Which is very good, but, not over a full day of heavy use for me. \nI used the 5X on Wi-Fi for Navigation using Google Maps with satellite view for about 30 minutes, and the battery temperature reached 117\u00b0F. Note that I do have it set to full brightness.\nI have watched Netflix and YouTube 1080p, and the 5X runs this without a hitch. Software: \nThe first thing I need to mention is that the software is way different from any USA spec\u2019d Android device that I have used. It is closer to what you would see in an Apple iPhone. They changed the look dramatically. There is no app drawer by default (although you can add a third party one). All the apps are thrown on the screen, just like the iPhone. So for those who are coming from iPhones, then this can be a positive. And this is true, however, using a third party launcher in conjunction with to achieve some maneuverability, you can rely on folders to organize the apps. I did use the stock UI for about a week and then changed to Nova Launcher, which is what I use on all my phones, and once I installed Nova, the experience isn\u2019t far off from other phones that I used. Some icons appear to be cutoff or otherwise \u201cweird\u201d due to the way that Honor maximizes the icons. However, this could be fixed using a third party launcher with a third party icon pack. \nAnother annoying thing is that it will sometimes pop up \u201cConsumption reminder\u201d messages indicating that a certain app is consuming power. While power users might find this useful for troubleshooting purposes, normally, I don\u2019t want to see that. \nSome other things that power users might enjoy is the \u201cProtected apps\u201d section in the settings \u2013 you can allow or dis-allow apps to run when the screen is off. However, by default, all of the apps that you installed are set to off, by default. So if you want some apps to run when the screen is off, then be sure to enable it. There is also a \u201cNetworked apps\u201d section, which allows you to disable either mobile data or Wi-Fi for any app you install, or all apps. There is also a \u201c Data Traffic Management\u201d section which tells you how much data you used on a particular day.\nSwiping down from the top brings up the notification panel, which shows the notifications in chronological order with a time stamp next to them. This is a nice addition over stock Android. Also, on the topic of notification bar, when in airplane mode, you can only have 4 notification icons. If you have 5 or more notifications, then you will see 3 plus the overflow icon. Keep in mind that if you are running Maps, then the location and Maps notifications already take up two of the four slots. I wished that they could just use a small airplane icon, instead of plastering a large chunk of the notification bar with the words \u201cAirplane mode\u201d. Those who don\u2019t like heads up (Banner) notifications can disable them under Settings-Notification center. You will need to uncheck the \u201cbanner\u201d option for each app.\nOne nice thing is that when a Bluetooth device is connected, then you will see a battery bar for the Bluetooth device. This is something that I haven\u2019t seen on any other Android device.\nThere is a one handed UI, and you can choose which side it goes on, but you cannot resize the window. \nThere are some built in motion controls like flip to mute, double tap to turn on the screen, and draw a letter to open an app. The letter cannot be changed, however the app that it opens can be customized. Also, if you have a secure lock screen, then drawing a letter will only take you to the lock screen. Drawing a letter again will ask for the pin or password. After you enter it then the app you select will open. Though honestly, it is much simpler to just set a fingerprint to open the app you want. \nThe Smart Assistance Menu also has some nice features :\nI particularly like the touch disable mode, which disables touches when in the pocket, so you don't have to worry about accidentally pressing something. Camera: \nThe camera is good considering the price point. It does look very much like the iPhone camera app. Phones in the $200 price range have improved dramatically in terms of camera over the past few years. My Moto G 1st gen camera is pretty terrible. But this camera is good, but not perfect. It doesn\u2019t have Optical Image Stabilization, which is expected for the price tag. It does get grainy in low light shots, but still acceptable considering the price point. If this phone came out in 2013, then the camera would have been considered excellent. But in 2015 (and early 2016), $200 phones have had really good cameras like the Moto G 3rd Gen. As such, the camera is about average in its class, which is a good thing.Fingerprint scanner: \nAnd finally, I saved the best for last \u2013 the Fingerprint scanner is top notch. It is more accurate than my Note 5, and extremely quick. You can add up to 5 fingers. In addition to unlocking the screen, it has the following capabilities\n-App lock (require FPS to open certain apps, needs to be enabled under fingerprints, then select apps in the \u201cPhone Manager\u201d app)\n-Access safe (You can set select files to require a fingerprint to view them)\n-Quick Launch \u2013 You can setup a fingerprint to open a certain app or call a certain contact. \nAside from this, you can use any finger for the following:\n-Back button \u2013 tap the FPS\n-Back to home \u2013 Long press the FPS\n-Take a photo/video \u2013 long press the FPS\n-Answer call \u2013 long press the FPS\n-Stop alarm \u2013 Long press the FPS\n-Show recent applications \u2013 Swipe up on the FPS\n-Show notification panel \u2013 Swipe down on the FPS\nNote that I rest my index finger on the FPS when in my hand, so I disabled the back button and back to home options, as it would accidentally trigger those when I rest my finger on the FPS.Miscellaneous\n-The speaker is pretty loud, but one thing I don\u2019t like is the minimum volume above silent is a little high. \n-No NFC\n-No Wi-Fi 5GHzConclusion: \nOverall, if you can get over the performance glitches, then it is a good phone for the price range. The Fingerprint scanner is excellent and Honor threw in many nice features with it. I am not docking for the EMUI design, as it is a personal preference, and installing a third party launcher can alleviate most of it. I am a bit disappointed that it is launching in the USA without Marshmallow, but at least they did push the January security update about 2 weeks after the Nexii, which isn\u2019t bad.\nHowever, the $200 price tag is a tightly contested space. Asus Zenphone 2 can be had for $200, OnePlus X $250 (Snapdragon 801), G Flex 2 (Snapdragon 810, same in the Nexus 6P) dropped to $230 as of 1/28/16. The Nexus 6(Snapdragon 805) 32 GB has dropped to $200 before and has dropped a few times to $250. All providing substantially better performance than the 5X \u2013 BUT \u2013 all lack metallic body and top notch fingerprint scanner.

If you thought that 2015 was the year of the midrange price phone, Honor is kicking off 2016 with a device that sets some higher expectations on materials and build quality in this price range. Will a killer body and low $200 price entice customers to the Honor brand? Let\u2019s find out.About this review:\nI tested the Honor 5X on the T-Mobile network without a microSD card installed. Dual-SIM capability was not in scope for my review as this is uncommon for use in the United States. The Honor 5X was provided to me by Mobile Nations through Honor. During the review, the Honor 5X received a system update with the January 2016 Security Level. Mobile Data, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS (high accuracy) were all enabled.Hardware\nThe Honor 5X in-hand feels more expensive than it\u2019s $200 price tag suggests. Put a more recognized brand name on the back and this device could easily go for $300 and up. The brushed-aluminum back impresses and the slight curves makes the phone easy to hold. Coupled with the weight coming in at 158g, the Honor 5X has an airy but solid feeling.\nPhysically, the Honor 5X is nearly the same size as the third generation Moto X Pure Edition. On the back, top center sits the 13-megapixel rear camera flanked by the flash to the side. Below the camera is the excellent fingerprint sensor. Up top, you\u2019ll find a mic and the 3.5mm audio port. Down below is the micro USB port with a speaker on side and a mic on the other. On the front you\u2019ll find the 5-megapixel front-facing camera, proximity and ambient light sensors, the notification LED, and earpiece above the 5.5 1080P (Full HD) IPS LCD display. The right side features all the buttons, with volume rocker above the power button. The left side has two SIM trays - the top one for use with a Micro SIM card, the other a dual tray with support for a Nano SIM and a micro SD card.\nOne missing piece of note is that the Honor 5X does not support 5 GHz Wi-Fi. You may notice a difference on crowded 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi networks.\nBut take a step back and the phone screams premium. You\u2019re getting very solid hardware at relatively low price.Fingerprint Sensor\nThe Honor 5X has an excellent fingerprint sensor. Set up was a breeze. I\u2019ve become accustomed to pulling the phone out of my front pocket while having my index finger on the sensor. By the time I\u2019m face to screen, I\u2019m at the home screen.\nBased on the results of the Android Central Readers\u2019 Choice Awards, it seems as though the having the Fingerprint Sensor on the back if the preferred choice for the Android Central crowd. The Honor 5X is my first daily use of a Fingerprint Sensor and for me, I would have preferred to have the sensor on the front of the device. My day job has me at a desk for most of the day and I\u2019ve found it cumbersome to pick the device up to unlock it to check my notifications.\nEither way, the Fingerprint Sensor just works - works well, works quickly.Camera\nIt seems like camera and image quality was the headline feature of higher-end Android devices in 2015. At $200, the Honor 5X seems to do an adequate job with photography.\nHonor\u2019s camera app feels quick to launch and is relatively easy to use. You can scroll through various shooting modes and a dedicated on-screen buttons for the flash and switching between cameras. Tap to focus worked well in, especially in good lighting. \nThe Honor 5X camera\u2019s auto modes were average and low light, indoor photos were useable for stationary objects. The front-facing camera worked well indoors for this price point. See Sample Photos below.Audio\nCalls on the Honor 5X using the earpiece were clear. I had no issues hearing callers and callers had no issues hearing me. \nSwitching over to speakerphone, the single bottom speaker was clear and loud enough. Audio from videos and music sounded fine. It\u2019s not as loud and clear as say the dual front-facing speakers of a Moto X Pure Edition, but the Honor 5X\u2019s speaker sounds good.Software\nFirst things first. Before I get into the software experience, there are two areas in the settings that users should be aware of, Power Saving and Protected Apps. This review was written with Power Saving mode set to \u201cNormal\u201d and all apps I\u2019ve downloaded set to be able to run after the screen is turned off. On day 1, I noticed some wonkiness with performance - especially with multitasking and coming back from screen off.\nEMUI is Honor's (and Huawei\u2019s) custom interface for Android. The Honor 5X is running EMUI 3.1 on top of Android 5.1.1. It\u2019s not Marshmallow but I can forgive that at this price point. That doesn\u2019t mean Honor is not committed to updates. During my testing, the Honor 5X received an update that bumped the security level from December 2015 to January 2016. \nYou\u2019ll notice the look and feel will be very iPhone/iOS-like. One reason is that EMUI has no app drawer. All apps are placed on a homescreen. You may want to disable app shortcut settings in Google Play or you may see a toast pop-up message after installing an app that says a shortcut was already created. For Android users that never use iOS, this may take some getting used to but if you\u2019ve used an iPhone, your setup on EMUI will likely just have a bunch of folders for your various apps and games. If this bothers you, you can just install a new launcher.Battery\nPersonally, I don\u2019t run battery benchmarks to come up with my thoughts on battery. As mentioned earlier, Power Saving mode was set to \u201cNormal\u201d and every app I downloaded was allowed to run in the background while the screen is off. Mobile Data, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS (high accuracy) were all enabled. I\u2019m not the type to shut these down.\nBased on my mixed usage, the 3000 mAh will get me through a days of use. In a typical day, I\u2019ll make a call or two, send and receive about 10 to 30 text messages, while checking in on various group chats on Hangouts. As far as media, I\u2019d watch a 5 to 10 minute YouTube video or two and stream over Google Play Music or Pocket Casts. The only days where I battery took a significant hit was when I played the GPS-heavy Ingress for about an hour. 15 to 30 minutes of Bloons Tower Defense 5 didn\u2019t do anything significant.\nOverall, users will find battery to be more than adequate though at 3000 mAh with no Quick Charge 2.0, it may take some time to top-up. The included 1A charger is slow and you may want to buy 2.1A wall and car chargers for day to day use.Closing Thoughts\nHonor's first official smartphone for the US market is a solid value. This phone is only $200. While there are trade-offs (\"flagship-level\" images, NFC), I feel that giving customers a big screen, an excellent Fingerprint Sensor, and all-day battery make the Honor 5X a solid competitor in a now crowded good mid-range market. Honor still needs to work on refining (and possibly simplifying) their behind the scenes options but for a first effort, they've done a remarkable job with the 5X.Who should buy this phone?Customers wishing to save money by not buying a \u201cflagship\u201d.Customers that want a great Fingerprint Sensor unlocking experience.Customers looking for a premium design without the premium cost.What would I change?The memory and battery defaults are conservative. In my opinion, the defaults should be set to normal and every downloaded app should be able to run with the screen off.Can I suggest an aggressive \u201cTurbo\u201d mode?NFC would complete the Fingerprint Sensor experience.The quick hits:Pros:Retail price is only $200.One of the best Fingerprint Sensor unlocking experiences at any price point.Good enough camera at this price point.Materials and build quality are a steal at this price point.Cons:Honor\u2019s software could be a little less aggressive with memory and battery management - default settings are conservative.iPhone-like default home screen could take a little getting used to for Android users.A great fingerprint sensor without NFC (and Android Pay) feels like a missed opportunity.Limited to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.", "time": "02-01-2016 04:52 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4980495", "text": "Sample Photos:\nNote: these were uploaded from the Honor 5X directly to Imgur through the Imgur app.\nPosted via the Android Central App", "time": "02-03-2016 01:48 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4981536", "text": "Now, these pics are not bad at all.
