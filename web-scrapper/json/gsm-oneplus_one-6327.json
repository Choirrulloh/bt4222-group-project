It was fully charged but no sign of starting. I contacted Support, and went through a rigmarole with some helpful person, who could only ask was it fully charged, then that I should back it up fully. (Why have someone with so little skill here I don't know, though she was very helpful, it would have been better to have someone more knowledgeable). She upgraded the issue to the next level and suggested I make an appointment for an online review, (incidentally I did that and it is arranged for 2 days time). She gave me a series of files to download in advance. I was insistent about the urgency and she got someone to speak to me almost immediately. \r\nSo i opened a real time session with the next guy, and as soon as i say i'm using a macbook, he backs off. Says it must be returned to them. It seems they could have restarted it remotely if i had a windows pc. Note one of the files I downloaded seemed to be a driver to allow an apple pc to talk through a USB port to the phone. This guy never mentioned that! \r\nAnyway, the next i get is a voucher and address label for the phone to be sent back by DHL. The address on the label is in Germany! I'm in England! So 2 days later DHL show up and pick up the phone! \r\nI'm here 5 days later having been told just now it takes 5 to 7 days to process it for repair. Remember they told me it could be fixed online in 45 minutes! So I've had no phone for a week, my business is dependent on a phone, and i haven't talked to my kids in 10 days (they live in another country). \r\nNow I love the phone. Its easy use, and has a great screen. I cannot give a technical review like others here but I like it, especially the price. Except for: \r\nThe pain I had transferring data from an iphone and the convenient links to my macbook.  \r\nContacts: Some of my contacts didn't transfer. The phone wants to search google rather than the address book. So if I'm roaming, I cannot get some of my contacts. Inconvenient to say the least! \r\nPhotos: My photos don't automatically go to my laptop anymore! Some of my stored photos on my laptop have disappeared. I use Viber a lot. I get photos on Viber but cannot upload to my macbook. \r\nMusic: I use iTunes, I don't buy much music, and never online downloads. One of the problems i had with my iphone was that lack of storage for music. It was an iphone 4 and could only handle 100 to 125 songs. Not great out of my library of 7500. So I thought i would be able to get them onto my oneplus. I'm not sure, I think it's playing my music from my library but over the internet. I cannot see what's on the phone as it doesn't link to my macbook! \r\nSupport: Well I read about poor support but I liked the price enough to gamble on a new oneplus. \r\nWell you've seen the story above. Am I happy? no! My biggest problem is not knowing what is happening or when and if I'll get my phone back.  \r\nMy advice to potential buyers, is to consider the lack of linkage to macbook before mixing technology!\n", "date": "26 Mar 2016"}, {"text": "it has been December 2014, now the battery charge doesn't stay much, it gets heated up easily.

Everyone (mostly the people who updated the phone to the latest software update) who has purchased this phone. Well definitely this is a bug in Cyanogenmod OS where the 3rd Noise cancellation MIC [located near the camera] overreacts ;) to any kind of noise( including your voice) it captures and try to minimizes it. This results in call & voice breaks. The algorithm written for Noise cancellation using the 3 MICs is not working properly. And frankly speaking CM team is struggling to fix this.\n \r\nSo, for the time-being people who are facing this issue can make use of any of the following methods to fix this issue: \r\n1) Paste a tape over the 3rd Mic [located near camera] and cover it completely [Or] \r\n2) Uninstall any Call recorder software that you have installed [And] \r\n3) Disable \"Ok Google\" voice detection in Google Settings ->Search & Now-> Voice->\"Ok Google\" detection -> Disable all the 3 options\n \r\nThe method 2&3 worked for me and lot of other people too. Disabling of call recorder & Ok Google solves the issue because both these apps depend on MICs to capture the voice and when MIC is used, the buggy Noise cancellation algorithm kicks in and hence the problem starts.\n \r\nSo, people who think its a Hardware or Phone problem, please relax and enjoy your 1+1 as this is a SW problem and u can fix it using the above tweaks.\n \r\nKeep smiling. bye :) ", "date": "13 Aug 2015"}, {"text": "Last night I bought Oneplus with 64gb memory, from the store I bought it charge the battery for afew minutes at home the phone showed  thsat the battery low. so I charcan't be charge the battery.

I'd like to share a few  things tht i have found from my usage , \n\n \r\n1.first of all, Its a great phone for this price range excellent design and performance.\n \r\n2. Display quality is too good. it has a very good viewing angle and neat colour reproduction.. touch sensityvity is so good and because of the best hardware specs u will feel like butter smooth performance each time u using this device.. in display settings it gives additional options for sunlight enhancement and colour enhancement, enable these options and view the phone in direct sunlight.. its so sharp and clear. best thing about the display, its not getting heat even after heavy usage.. but it gets hot when u record video by keeing ur flash on.. ( only at the top edge, and its normal).. overall u wont get a chance to worry abt ur phone display until and unless u drop the phone\n \r\n3. about the camera- camera quality is not so awesome as expected..if you are a user came from sony xperia, motorola or samsung experiece u wont get compleately satisfied with the picture output.. after all , i personally expected much more neat images from a 13mp sony 6 lens exmor camera.  the dual flash is not so brilliant comparatively with other single flash phones. but stil its great. \n \r\nthe front cam quality is awesome...its really excellent. u wil surely say wow!! i have found these kind of clarity front cam only in apple ipads ..\n \r\n3.external speakers sound quality is is good but the sound quality of the earpiece is muffled.. sometime  its hard to recognise other end sound when attending calls from traffic or the other end person is speaking through the headset. its been said that this phone has 3 mics built in .. but personally i didn't feel any remarkable difference when i play my  voice clip in whatsapp. and most of the time, during calls, friends said they r not able to hear \"clearly\"what im saying. they can hear , but im telling abt the clarity of voice.. in long duration calls after 20 to 30,min the sound becomes like that u r coverd ur phone with a blanket and speak through it. but once u disconnect the call and call back , again sound wil become clear( its not because of network, cos i m in a very good coverage area and no problems with my other phones )..  \r\nloud speaker quality is superb. \r\n4. battery life is neat.. for me it gives 8-9 hours of battery life when using internet over wi fi (its like countinues usage) .. i was very much worried abt the battery life cos its 5.5\" screen.. but one plus has done their battery so good.. it providing  12 to 13 hrs of battrey life even  while keeping the phone in 3g mobile data on and light use of internet.\n \r\n5.performance wise its  really rocks ..i nevr had any issue in its performance and the phone never heats up while gamming ( i just tried only for testing.dnt know abt long duration game play and higher end games)\n \r\nthese are the pros and cons i personally felt in my usage..  and this sound and camera issues i feel like its because of the cyanogen mode rom. i faced  these issues when i tried some  cyanogen and paranoid roms in my other phones too.hopes it may get improved with the one plus one oxygen update.\n \r\nand one more thing if u r buying this one please do buy the original tampered glass screen protector..the  phone is awesome n good but if it falls, display faced down , seriously u wont have a smiling face after u picked up from ground", "date": "02 Mar 2015"}, {"text": "very", "date": "01 Mar 2015"}, {"text": "I really  don't know because its only one day now I have received my opo.

I wonder what prevents them from offering a detailed online manual which the poor customer could download and refer to at leisure.What is available online is a quick start guide which explains how to switch on,insert SIM etc. \r\nIf you search the Web you will not find any contact details of the customer support team. After many emails and telephones the Amazone team gave me the customer care number and an email id( support.in@oneplus.net ,tel :01204970940).The email support initially helped me with an issue of connecting the phone to PC however when the problem persisted they asked me to share my number so that they could call me and solve the issue. They gave me a call within 2 hrs ,but surprisingly my true caller app identified the incoming caller as Micromax support!!!!If you call the customer service telephone line it will make you hold the line atleast for 5 min before getting you connected!! \r\nThe problem of PC linking is still not sorted out and their executives have given me various solutions  none of them being a permanent fix!! \r\nSince there is no technical backup other than the forum, I have no idea how to address this issue now.A link for USB driver I found in the forum, to be installed on the computer was infected with virus!! i.e. the forum is not trustworthy and crowd sourcing the technical support may not be the solution for customer care!!! \r\nI sincerely hope this customer support issue is sorted out fast.

You have to get an Indian invite", "date": "03 Feb 2015"}, {"text": "Well guys I have spent 3 weeks with the oneplus one and here is my experience with the phone so far: \r\n1. Camera is pretty good, although the looks of the camera UI are quite dated. The dual-LED flash is not as powerful as I expected it to be, but still brighter than the sony xperia sp that I had before. \r\n2. The cyanogenmod user interface is just awesome. I have always been a fan of the stock android interface and the customization options just make it even better. \r\n2. The preloaded cyanogen gallery app sucks somewhat. I tried selecting the option to edit the photo but no photo editor would open. I ultimately downloaded the Nexus Gallery app from play store and disabled the cyanogen gallery. \r\n3. The file manager also simply sucks. It doesn't have a cut/paste option. There is a 'copy' option but it simply creates a second copy of the file in the same directory itself. Again I downloaded File Commander app from play store because of this. \r\n4. Performance of the phone on the default Dalvik runtime and the 'interactive' CPU governor was just average. Several transition effects were stuttery, and basic apps like settings took 2-3 seconds to load (multitasking wasn't an issue though). It felt as if I'm using a moto g with snapdragon 400 instead of a phone with snapdragon 801. I finally changed runtime to ART (via developer options) and set CPU governor to 'performance' to get the performance I expected from a snapdragon 801 (the phone might become a bit unstable by changing runtime but so far my phone rebooted itself only once so such reboots are very rare I guess). \r\n5. After fiddling with the CPU modes and stuff I'm sure battery life would be a little worse than before but for me it has not been an issue at all. The phone lasts for a day atleast with heavy internet usage, an hour of asphalt 8 and frequent use of whatsapp, instagram and facebook and some 2 hours of listening to music. \r\n6. The phone does tend to get overheated while charging (after modifying runtime and CPU settings) and temperature goes up to around 42\u00b0C but charging speed itself is pretty quick so that is again not an issue. The phone goes from 0-100% in about one and half hour so that is also fast enough.\n \r\nHope this review helps all everyone out there.", "date": "03 Feb 2015"}, {"text": "How long does it takes to receive invitation for an indian??", "date": "03 Feb 2015"}, {"text": "excellent device \r\nexcellent camera \r\nexcellent perfomance \r\nexcellent battery  \r\nHANDS ON!", "date": "03 Feb 2015"}, {"text": "is it a chinese phone", "date": "03 Feb 2015"}, {"text": "no difference between chinese ,indian and the globle version all are same", "date": "03 Feb 2015"}, {"text": "I have use 1month 1+1 not a single problem", "date": "03 Feb 2015"}, {"text": "I think u r phone is manufactured problem", "date": "03 Feb 2015"}, {"text": "you definitely made a big mistake because there is no better phone than this one at this price range", "date": "02 Feb 2015"}, {"text": "the screen turns light yellow if you press on the screen with your finger. the internet connection sometimes automatically stops working. you have to turn the phone off & then back on which wastes time when you're busy & one the go.", "date": "02 Feb 2015"}, {"text": "I want to  warn other potential customers about the OnePlus phone which I bought in December 2014 & was using it for about 2 weeks.

Superb build quality and especially the sandstone finish feels so different and elegant. SUPERB gripping.\n \r\n2)Read/write On Phone via Pc is Very fast. 64Gb storage a super +\n \r\n3)Cyanogen has done an excellent job. Super fluid Os.\n \r\n4)Cyanogen Theme store is so amazing that everyday i feel i have a new phone( s/w wise) due to immense ablity of the theme engine to modify the os. \r\nU name the Company/interface they have on the theme store. Max are paid but still they all are Super. Just search play store by typing Cyanogen Themes and u have 100's.\n \r\n5) Screen Recorder is great. So easy to make demos which wud be only possible after rooting other phones.\n \r\n6)Ultra Fast! SMOOTH Animations, Great Transitions Overall great Ui and Change able whenever you want.\n \r\n7)sound quality in Headphones is Top Notch. Audio engine is super guys. The bass boost to surround aound & all the effects actually work. What a sound chip.\n \r\n8)Customizable to the limit. Impossible is nothing for OPO\n \r\n9)Love the option to switch between On screen buttons and Hardware Keys. Never seen anything like this\n \r\n10)Amazing Battery life, with heavy usage i am easily getting a days backup. With nearly 5hr screen on time and 3hr voice calls.\n \r\n11)It feels so light in the hand. The weight balancing done by opo is simply superb and mind blowing. Being a 5.5\" phone u dont feel the weight.\n \r\nUpdated on 12/12/14\n \r\n12)The best thing it has both Micro /nano sim adapters... So actually from whichever phone u are porting u dont need to worry about the Sim card. \n \r\nThe Good /Average things\n \r\n1)The camera is not top notch. I personally use the M8 and am a fan of it never used a better camera/camera ui. \r\nBut this in any case does not mean that is not good but certainly not the best.\n \r\n2)Sound via speakers sometimes crackles at max volume.\n \r\n3)Screen is very good but comparing it to My Samsung tab s 8.4\"/M8 the color depth and saturation is not equivalent. \r\nFor a normal user who is not very particular this is still an excellent screen with great pixel density.\n \r\n4)Cyanogens gallery app cud have been better. Not bad but Dil Maange More Type of feeling and expectation from cyanogen. Wink.\n \r\nI think this is enough. But seriously guys its one hell of a killer. From looks to performance its a power house.\n \r\nGo for it u wont regret it and will actually realise that at such a low cost such devices can be made.

In similar circumstances our dear Nokia Asha was giving much better reception and calling quality.  \r\nIn the quest of making the best phone 'flagship killer' Chinese actually forgot to provide basic phone features in the device.  \r\nThank god I got it from Amazon who have now promised to take this back and refund my money.", "date": "07 Dec 2014"}, {"text": "Hi, \r\ni am also getting the same issue did yo find any solution for that.

I like a lot of things about the OPO: customizability, battery life, screen size/resolution; but the entire system is buggier than my Nexus 5. The OPO is also laggy compared to the Nexus. The screen sensitivity is a major problem... I have to tap 2, 3 or 4 times to get a click to register. The lag between \"clicking\" and the next screen loading is painful. The delay between a registered \"click\" and the readiness to accept another \"click\" is frustrating. (e.g. I click the \"Messages\" icon, and the screen opens, I quickly tap on a conversation, but the click never registers. I have to give the handset a split second after the screen loads before it'll accept another click. That happens in various applications, and is a huge issue compared to my Nexus 5.) These are issues that are independent of network connectivity. It's going from the lock screen to the home screen. From the home screen to the \"Phone\" screen. From the tray to open the calculator. Bringing up the keyboard in messaging & email apps. Etc. \n \r\nSwiping down to open the notification bar and settings menu is dodgy... it'll open, but sometimes slide back closed. Or open halfway and then close again. Then it won't register the next swipe down, and I'll have to swipe 2-3 times to get it to open correctly.\n \r\nScreen orientation/rotation is slow and sometimes locks up on me. Apps crash regularly that have always worked without a glitch on my Nexus 5. While on the lock screen yesterday, I couldn't enter any characters because there was a constant stream of numbers being input while the phone was sitting untouched on my desk. I tried to hit \"back,\" the power button, \"enter,\" all to no avail. I had to wait about 2 minutes for the stream of numbers to stop. Another time while on lock screen, the keypad refused to accept any of my touches while attempting to enter my security code. Result: I couldn't unlock the phone for 5 minutes until it started working again. \n \r\nThere's great potential, but the entire experience feels like it's in beta and not completely solid or ready for general release.

Why? well here's the story.\n \r\nI have always had a fascination about mobile/cellular technology and have had too many handsets than I'd care to remember.  I have spent quite a few years working in the mobile retail industry too, so I know the odd thing or two about them.\n \r\nIn the Western part of the world, we tend to be cautious of things that come from Asia, in particular from China. Why? Well that's another discussion altogether.  But even people from that part of the world even tend to stay clear.  Is this a fair assumption? I think so.  Is it fair to the companies in China? I don't think it is.\n \r\nFrom out of nowhere, (well, OPPO to be precise) a company called OnePlus hit the headlines claiming to be the 'Flagship Killer'.  Could this be so?  I mean, who are they? What's their game?\n \r\nHaving read about the One, I liked the look of the specs and looked for comparisons.  I liked the look of the LG G3 and was contemplating that on a \u00a333 monthly tariff on the 3 network. (If you haven't guessed by using the pound sterling sign, I'm in the UK)  This would have gotten me 600 minutes, Unlimited Text, free calls to 0800 number and all you can eat data and tied into a 24 month contract.\n \r\nI thought this was ok but though I would look at their sim only plans.  The above tariff was plentiful for me, 600 minutes equates to 10 hours per month talk time.  I'm a guy, I don't talk on the phone that much!  I didn't really want to be tied into a contract if I could help it so looked at their 1 month rolling plans.  There is was the above tariff, \u00a321 a month, can quit at any time.  So I worked the difference out between that and the first tariff which, accounted for a \u00a3288 price difference over the 2 years which isn't that bad considering the LG G3 is worth \u00a3500 to buy sim free.\n \r\nI looked around to see what that \u00a3288 could buy and wasn't amused to the lack of choice.  I wanted an all singing/all dancing handset.  Nothing took my fancy!\n \r\nBy this time, I completely forgot that I had registered my interest into the OnePlus One handset until, one day late in August I was sent an invite to buy the handset.  So I looked up the specs again but since other people had been getting their handsets I read a few of the reviews on there.  I took into account that one only hears negative comments about products.  We, as human beings are quick to raise a grievance but extremely slow to show our appreciation.\n \r\nI was a bit hesitant when I read about a yellow band, yet relieved to hear there was a work around (not fix) but a work around where you could blend the colours on the screen.  I decided there and then I'll order the handset.\n \r\nAs soon as I ordered I joined in on the forums (forums.oneplus.net) where I could converse with other users hear their experience and to help new forum members as time went on.\n \r\nThe Camera is astonishing, it's not cheap by all means, it has Sony's latest Exmor R sensor and takes stunning images and video recordings. I love being able to film my dog being ditzy, chasing her tail or running after a ball in slow motion, filming at 120fps in 720.  \n \r\nThe battery is great for a phone this powerful.  I get 2 days out of it with constant use, bluetooth, wifi, gps, constant checking of emails from the servers, full screen brightness all switched on which I think is pretty impressive.\n \r\nThe speakers....Well, I don't have to plug in any external speakers to hear my music.  I can now leave my handset in the living room whilst I'm working away in the kitchen.  This is two rooms away and I can hear the sound crystal clear.  One of my previous handsets was another One, the HTC One, again, this was a great handset but boy, the OnePlus One knocks the HTC out of the water!\n \r\nThis handset, by far, is the best handset I have EVER owned.  I believe when they say, It certainly IS a flagship killer.  Like they've said to Apple \"Welcome to the PLUS family\" :)\n \r\nFor half the price of a 'flagship' I have certainly got the best handset going!", "date": "15 Sep 2014"}, {"text": "To claim under warranty, simply go to the OnePlus website (link below) and submit your claim.\n \r\nPlease bear in mind that they are a new company, they are still evolving, they still have a lot of queries from customers wanting the handset.
