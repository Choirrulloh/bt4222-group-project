We can see \"black borders\" on the screens of other common digital products, such as tablets, PC and TV.\nWhat on earth is the black border? Is it necessary?\nAccording to Baidu.com, the black border is artificially designed, and its nomenclature is BM area. While being assembled, the screen of each phone has error and can't be absolutely aligned. If the screen frame is aligned with visible edges of BM area, bright borders will appear around the screen. Therefore, the primary function of the BM area is to prevent light leakage. Some phone screens show obvious light leakage due to the issue of screen assemble and the BM area cannot effectively conceal it.\nCan the black border on the phone screen be narrowed?\nThe width of the BM area is affected by three factors: The width of the LCD screen frame (a); the gap between the LCD screen and the front cover (b); and width of the dispensed adhesive between the panel and the front cover (c).\n1\uff09\tFirst, the width of the LCD screen is determined by the component itself and the choice of the manufacturers. Currently, the width of the LCD screen of the mainstream manufacturers is between 1 and 1.4mm;\n2\uff09\tThe gap between the LCD screen and the front cover is affected by assembly technology. The greater the technology, the closer the gap.\n3\uff09\tThe width of the dispensed adhesive can't be narrowed infinitely. The best technology of the industry can make it as narrow as 0.4 to 0.5mm. Excessive narrowing the width of the dispensed adhesive may affect the reliability of the LCD components, and the adhesive of the lens may break off.\nThe black border is widely existing, and the width of the black border is generally above 1.7mm. To narrow or eliminate the black border is depends on the technological breakthroughs in components, assembly and adhesive. Many manufacturers (I will not reveal their names) have managed to narrow the border to the largest extent. This actually harms the interest of the consumers!\nSince the black border can't be narrowed, is there any method to visually conceal the black border?\nThe general practice of the industry is to paint the black border in the same color with the glass panel in order to hide the black border. When the screen is lit up, the screen seemingly has no black border. But when the screen is turned off, the physical border of the phone looks wider. Currently, iPhone 6s Plus is using this technology. Meanwhile, we have noticed that some manufacturers have adopted a different method--using curved glass to weaken the black border. \nLet\u2019s use Huawei Mate 8 as an example, the actual width of its black border is 1.7mm, representing an advanced level in the industry. At the same time, it has adopted 2.5D drilled and cut float glass, which effectively narrows the width of the black border visually but will not affect the visual effect of the physical frame of the phone. \nHuawei is killing two birds with one stone!", "time": "03-29-2016 12:51 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5091975", "text": "Why does this make me feel like you work for or with Huawei?

SpookDroid notices the difference. I can't see any difference on a 55\" LCD TV screen at normal viewing distance between HD video and 4k video unless I get close enough to see individual pixels - and with plastic implants in my eyes, II have near-perfect vision. There's nothing I can't read on my Note 3 - maybe if someone comes out with an app with a 1 pt. font I'll have a problem, but that's difficult on paper too.\nAs for the battery, it also depends on the screen technology. An Amoled screen's power drain is mostly influenced by color - if it's displaying black, even an 8k screen will be drawing nothing. But if it's all white, a 4k screen with more pixels will be drawing a LOT more current than an HD screen. Straight LED screens will draw a little more for more pixels, but not enough to save more than a few minutes of battery by making it a 1080 screen.\nThe big advance is going to be in batteries. Once the automotive industry solves their problem (you don't see many cars with lithium batteries - they fail too often and are too expensive to replace), the cellphone battery industry can use the same chemistry or physics (whatever is developed) to give us 10,000 mAh batteries in the same size as the current 3,000 mAh ones, and for not much more money.
