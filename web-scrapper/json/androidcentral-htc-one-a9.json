But as the saying goes, hide sight is 20/20.", "time": "01-04-2016 01:35 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4932297", "text": "I've only had my A9 for about a week, but I posted the following over at XDA. Some random thoughts in no particular order:\nThe interface has been very smooth, opening apps is quick, and memory management seems pretty solid. Browsing is good on wifi, but I haven't had a ton of time to try on LTE. Gaming is fair. I don't play that many games and the ones I do tend to be simpler fair (not much into 3d gaming). One candy crush-esque game that I play performs surprisingly poorly (doesn't deal well with a lot going on on screen at once) but it seems to be the exception.\nBattery life is meh at best. Standby time is really solid. I only lose about 3% battery overnight, but the battery noticeably drops as the device gets used. It charges ridiculously quickly with a quick charge 2.0 charger though.\nThe camera has been okay. I'm not a huge shutterbug, but the pictures I've taken have been sufficient. I find it loses focus sometimes with last second movement (taking pic of my dogs can be difficult) but it seems good enough. A step up from the Xperia Z3 I had been using (automatic mode), a big step up from the Nexus 5, not as good as the Note 4.\nThe screen is a thing of beauty. I put it on sRGB mode and it's just perfect. Gets way bright, and gets dim enough in a dark room. I tend to keep it about 25% brightness and it works just fine for me. \nSpeaker sound is pretty good for a bottom mounted speaker. Nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done and is more than loud enough for my needs. Sound from the headphones is easily the best I've had from a smartphone. The tones are rich and thick, gets quite loud without distortion, and just sounds great. YMMV depending on your musical tastes, but it works great for classic rock, hard rock, metal, blues and jazz.\nFingerprint scanner has been flawless so far. I've added just my two thumbs, and it hasn't missed yet regardless of angle. It unlocks the phone quicker than I can adjust my hand to use it, so the speed is just right. I haven't used it for anything other than unlocking the device though.\nSoftware is very on point. It has a lot of the simplicity of tock Android, but with Sense bells and whistles to up the game. I like the presentation. It feels very clean, intuitive and smooth. I miss the HTC Sense method of displaying recent apps, but other than that it seems like a good marriage of HTC and stock stylings. The theming engine is good, but slightly frustrating at times. I like the stock launcher and want to keep it, but the itch to modify more than what the theming allows for may prove too much.\nIt looks like an iPhone. HTC or anyone can spin it however they want, but it really does. I'm okay with that because I tend to think that the iPhone is an attractive design. That being said, when you hold it, it doesn't really feel like an iPhone. Compared to my wife's iPhone 6, it has a much more solid feel. It has better heft, feels a little sturdier, and has a really nice curve at the screen that your thumb just floats over. I'm not going to test the bendability of the device, but from feel alone I can't think of how it would bend without the use of tools. It really feels like an incredibly well made device, and it looks phenomenal. \nAll in all, I'm pretty happy with it so far. I think it's priced to high, but there really is a lot of quality here to enjoy. It's also the only device on the market that hits all of what I wanted in a device: 1) Amoled display. 2) Compact enough to use 1 handed. 3) 32 GB+ and SD Card expansion. 4) Premium build. 5) Stock or Light skin. 6) Rapid updates.", "time": "01-04-2016 06:17 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4933130", "text": "Thank you!

I've had HTC phones before and I've always loved them.

When I unboxed this phone, I fell in love immediately! It's a gorgeous phone! It's as big as the Xperia Z3 that I have, but the A9 feels so much better on the hands. It's definitely thinner. The entire phone just feels good to hold.\nI am not an amoled screen fan. I think the colors are oversaturated and sometimes subdued. I still prefer the screen on my Xperia Z5 Compact. However, amoled also enables this phone brightness to be on about 25% and still clear. \nI didn't like the launcher on this phone. I didn't like the fact that there was no option to change the app drawer to horizontal. It only came vertical scrolling. Xperia got this one right. So, I installed Nova Launcher and I'm happy.\nI was also suprised to learn that HTC Music app wasn't installed. I tried installing it but it would always crash. To solve that, I installed Pulsar+. Happy camper here.\nI like the font customization that HTC included. No, I LOVE IT! I'm glad they added this. \nCamera. I am not really particular about phone cameras as I do have a real one for when I need to take some shots. Having said that, I am impressed with the cameras on this phone. Clear. Crisp.

Not because it's ugly. It's because due to the obvious resemblance to the iPhone 6, it looks somewhat uninspired. Many \"iPhone-inspired\" phones have their own design changes, so they don't look that similar. HTC's A9 is more-or-less like an iPhone clone, apart from the camera placement and the front. I'm pretty sure that there are some out there who like the design and I don't fault them. I just feel that HTC lost its sense of unique design, which makes me feel rather sad. (Before you say Apple copied HTC, the iPhone 6 only had a similar antenna band design to the M7. The rest of the phone took design cues from the 5th generation iPod touch). The bezels also looks a bit too thick for my liking.\nIn terms of hardware, it's pretty solid. SD617, 3GB of RAM with the 32GB model, 1080p AMOLED display, 24-bit/192KHz audio support and all that. Nothing to write home about. Capable hardware that's decidedly upper-midrange, exactly the point of the A9.\nInstead, the main pros of this phone come from the software. Sense has been lightened and resembles stock Android more. HTC is also promising updates within 15 days after Nexus phones, which is very bold and we'll see if they can keep their promise. Aside from that, Sense is snappy, responsive and largely clutter-free.\nWe'll have to wait to get a final verdict.", "time": "10-20-2015 10:19 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4763622", "text": "I like it but then again I lie simple phones.

Here's a quick head's-up:\nFirst, it's significantly peppy for not having a hex-core.

It's screen clarity is comparable to your iPhone, but even thinner. However, it's a bit slippery. A good composite silicon/polycarb case will serve you well to 'fix' that (and only costs about $9 US on Amazon!)\nThird, the A9 is the ONLY phone currently able to use Q-Comm's 'Quick Charge 3' series of fast-charging. I tested it by running my phone down to 45% and, after only 45 mintes, was back to 93%! So you're less likely to need to carry a External battery. (Though I do have that, too, and even then it only uses 1/4 of a 15000 mAh battery plugged in the whole 8 hours at work.)\nFinally, it has a current-gen capacity for microSD, topping out theoretically at 2Tb. So, Just slot in a 128Gb or 256Gb card and go to town!\nMy only downside? The face 'protrudes' from the frame, so it will shatter easier.

I was extremely skeptical about the A9 when I first saw the design, then again when I saw the specs, then again when I saw the non-promo price. Somehow I still ended up ordering it at the $399 price point ($499 is too high and I hope HTC comes to their senses).\nI've been a fan of HTC in the past. I had a Vivid a few years ago, then a One Mini (another phone with middling specs that was surprisingly usable). I read the reviews of this phone on a dozen different sites and talked myself into taking the plunge. \nI know people are gonna mistake it for an iPhone, but the design does strike me as very premium looking, and I love the garnet color. The processor isn't the best, but I'm not into gaming, so I'm not too concerned. The memory is supposed to be fast and 3 gigs of RAM will help. The battery is small, but with Marshmallow out of the box, and quick charge 3.0 coming I think it'll be ok. Sound quality from the headphone jack is important to me, and HTC has made that a focus. The Uh oh protection is appealing if HTC doesn't fold in the next year.\nI've been using 5.5 and 5.7 inch phones and I'm ready to try 5\" again. The AMOLED display is supposed to be good. The Oneplus X gave me some pause, coming in at $150 cheaper than the promo price with a tried-and-true processor and good design itself (though I'll take metal over glass anyday). But no NFC, no finger-print scanner, no quick charging, no OIS and the need to wait for an invite or general sale down the line made it less appealing. It's still in the back of my mind if the A9 doesn't work out. I've had a Oneplus One and I was happy with the experience. I'm hoping HTC is rebounding though, so I'm giving them a fair shot.\nI'm on the list for a Oneplus X though, and at $250 I might buy one also and use them back-to-back, then see which one goes one the market", "time": "11-02-2015 01:51 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4797334", "text": "OnePlus X lacks bands 12 and 17, which means that if you are on AT&T or Tmobile, this phone is not going to have good reception.

Then feed by the press, the trolls will all come flying out from under their bridges to continue the savaging. However, you still have to make a stab in the dark how how many to have available. Your marketing people come up with 2000 over a 72 hour period. That would be just about 28 units per hour to sell out. Sounds good considering the total departure from what we have been doing and the anticipated butchering in the press. Low and behold, 2000 sell out in 48 hours, or less. That comes out to nearly 42 per hour or about 50% above what is expected. This is when you realize you've made a serious problem and have to ramp up production to meet the demand because other preorders are flooding in.\nSince you think it is just a joke to have 2000 units available for a 3 day preorder trial in a relatively small country, what is the correct #?

Although it is disappointing when a product we are all looking forward to receiving is delayed at least HTC sent out an email apologizing with a 25% off coupon on accessories. Now, contrast that to Apple's attitude on the first iPhone. It too sold out and those of us who had pre-ordered were told nothing. When it didn't arrive I called Apple to check on my order and their basic arrogant attitude toward me was \"we're sold out - tough stuff\". I still wanted one and was able to order one by phone from AT&T fulfillment. \nIt's easy to kick HTC when they're down, but frankly between them and Apple HTC has always shown me they care about their customers whereas Apple takes customers for granted and just assumes they will always be there because of their \"vastly superior iPhone\". Let me give tow contrasting examples of customer service I've received from these two companies. I called HTC recently about my M7 to schedule a repair for the proximity sensor. The long and short is that the rep didn't tell me my phone was out of warranty and she couldn't help me, but instead said \"let's see if we can fix your phone and avoid you having to send it in.\" And she did just that. My experience with Apple, and part of the reason I no longer buy their products, is that if your phone is one week out of warranty and you don't have Applecare they tell you they can't help you. \nIt doesn't bother me the A9 will be delayed. I'll have mine next Thursday and I'm fine with that.

Very impressed by the Snapdragon 617 so far. We let the device run down to 3% so that I could test the Quick Charge 3.0 Charger I bought from Aukey on Amazon. I was expecting is to meet the 2.0 charging speeds knowing that the software update has not yet been released for the 3.0 speed. My first 15 minute charge test was very disappointing, as the device went from 3% battery to 5% after 15 minutes. Again, the device may have been still syncing items and installing apps, but the screen was off and it was plugged into the 3.0 charger. The good news is that an OTA update popped up that night and the device went from under 10% battery up to around 60-70% while the OTA installed. I will post more information regarding the Quick Charge as I get more test data.\nSome things to note again - devices bought from HTC.com do not include headphones in the box. This is a small price to pay and you can honestly get great earbuds on Amazon for cheap anyways or use a pair from your last smartphone. Android Marshmallow will have you enter your passcode/pattern to decrypt the device every time you power it on from an off state. This is a mandatory security feature of Android 6.0 and later and is meant to protect you from thieves. The Deep Garnet color is not quite as vivid as some of the video's I have seen online. It all depends on how the light hits your device and sunlight vs indoors can vary. In indoor lighting, the device will appear slightly more on the maroon side with the hint of metallic and red tints. Outdoors, I feel that you get much more of the red color tone and it really appears more vivid. Battery life does go pretty quick for the first couple days while everything settles. When you get a new phone, of course you are going to toy with it a little more often while you get everything setup the way you want it. I will report back once my wife gets a few more days on the device and will compare it to the battery life she was getting from her LG G3. So far, she is very happy to be back on an HTC phone (M7 user before her G3) and the performance has been great.", "time": "12-10-2015 12:02 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4884940", "text": "I bought the HTC 2.0 quick charger.

Is Auto-Sync turned on in Settings>Accounts?\"\nI'm using the Gmail app, and yep, it's set to auto-sync. This has been an ongoing problem since I got the phone a week ago. My Gmail contacts would not sync, so I had to go back to Sprint and have them transfer the contacts from my old M7. Thank goodness they hadn't wiped it yet. Anything Google related, besides the Chrome browser, seems to not work. \nLock screen only works when I have the fingerprint set to be used as well. If I disable the fingerprint, the lock screen will not come on, even when it's set to \"lock screen\". \"Do you mean that you want to double-tap the screen to make the screen turn off?\"\nNo no, lol. I want to be able to hold my phone without the screen coming on. If I don't enable the fingerprint, there is no lock screen so when the screen comes on while I'm just holding the phone all kinds of apps get pressed and whatnot. Drives me crazy.\"Do you still see a list of apps that you can share to, or does it automatically share to the same app each time?\"\nI see a list of apps. It's just that when I try to share a picture from my Bible app to Instagram, it tells me that it cannot load the photo. This was never an issue on my M7. \"Do you mean that you have to tap the Recent Apps button first, then the Home button? Or vice-versa?\"\n(Sorry, I didn't know what it was called, lol). Yes, the Recent Apps button. Home only goes to the home screen if I'm on the Recent Apps screen. It doesn't work anywhere else. The fingerprint won't take me to home either, even though it is set to. \"Do you mean that the notification panel doesn't even come down, or that you never see any notifications there? Do you ever see notifications in the status bar?\"\nI never get any notifications of any kind in the status bar, and sometimes I pull the notification panel down just to make sure there's nothing up there, and there's not. For example, the only way I know I have a text it my phone is on silent is the little number that pops up on the text message icon. In notification settings I have it set for anything to show up in the status bar, so I'm not sure what seems to be the problem. I feel like there's a piece of my phone not installed since I'm having all these seemingly simple issues. \nThanks again for your help!", "time": "12-18-2015 04:10 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4903052", "text": "Go to Settings>Accounts-Google>[your account].

Guess here is as good as anywhere. \nA little backstory though. I've been on Windows Phone since WP7. The last version of Android I used was 2.1 on an HTC Aria. Then it was to the HTC Surround (WP7), Samsung Focus Flash (WP7), Nokia Lumia 920 (WP8/8.1), Nokia Lumia 1520 (WP8.1), and then Microsoft Lumia 640 (WP8.1/W10M preview). Since I've been gone from Android so long, I'm taking a fresh, open minded look at it. \nBuild quality of the A9 is excellent. It feels solid in my hand without being too heavy, size is just right. Screen, Looks excellent to me, sharp and even with the brightness on a lower setting (about 2/5 setting) is still bright enough to see on a sunny day. Speaker sounds better than what I've used previously, most of the Lumias were on the back. \nThe OS. This is different. The level of customization is taking some getting used to, but is nice. Some of it does seem gimmicky (live wallpapers, though some of the space ones are neat), but I like the icon changeability. Notifications are similar to what I'm used to, having to disable some apps notifications as I catch them. Some of the games can be annoying in the amount they deliver. I've found some apps that keep crashing on 6.0, and I've emailed devs as I catch them. The ability to remove permissions from apps is nice. Also, I like that HTC still includes their built in flashlight app instead of having to download one. \nCamera. I've only taken a couple of pictures so far, but they've been pretty good. No complaints on that front.\nBattery. I know this is the hot button here. I think it's decent. If I could stop playing around on it, it would probably last. Been catching up on some games though. Plus, I'm never really that far from a charger or battery pack. If you're just using is for basic day to day use,texting, emails etc, I think you'll be fine. If you're playing games a lot, or watching a lot of video, keep a charge source handy. But then I'm coming from a Lumia 640 with a 2500mAh battery, so I'm used to this as well. \nAll in all, I'm pleased with the A9, and enjoying this version of Android.\nEdit: A couple of things I miss from WP though. Live tiles, though some widgets are close. Glance screen. Nice being able to see if there's texts or emails without having to wake the phone fully. The notification light kind of does this, but you don't know what you have.

I don't try to play FPS games on mobile, I can't stand using a touchscreen for that, so to me those are a moot comparison. But anything like your puzzle games, physics games, they run fine. I think the streamlining that Marshmallow has is allowing Android to do the same, get better performance with the resources it has. Now if the OEM's would just streamline their UI, instead of trying to cram more \"features\". HTC has the right idea with the minimalistic version of Sense that is on the A9. \nBoth allow you to put apps into folders, though its 16 (MM) vs 9 (W10m).

That sets expectations high. They've given it a premium metal body, but a mid price processor. They've then made it look almost as if it were an iPhone, again, setting high expectations. They have a reasonable price, IMO, for the states but that price is only good until Nov. 7. Then it jumps to near flagship price in the US as it already is in the rest of the world.\nI've read/watched first impressions by nearly every Android site. They all seem to be in love with the phone. One guy even said he loved it so much it was going to be his daily driver. \nOnce the reviews started to come out they still overall love the phone, but give it moderately good scores. Biggest complaint is the battery followed by complaints of the camera, while the best HTC has put out is not up to snuff with flagship phones. The reviews are waffling back and forth comparing it to other midrange phones but also flagships. They all seem to run the battery tests they would run on flagships, even though in my mind, it isn't really geared to a buyer that would go after a flaghip. Then they say due to price you'd be better getting the Nexus 6P or other phablet. They also say to get the 5X since it is only $379. But that's wrong since, in US, this is a 32 GB phone which would be $429 but still only 2 GB of ram and no OIS for the 5X.\nI'm coming from a Nexus 5. I hate phablets. There is no way I want a phone that hard to handle. A 5\" screen is optimal to me. The battery on the N5 is only 2300. Not much of a difference to the 2150. I don't play games or watch movies on it. So battery doesn't seem like that big of a deal. Compared to the N5 the A9's camera sounds outstanding but the reviewers only thought it was adequate. A9 has OIS which, IMO, his huge.\nI've been leaning to the 5X, but I'm really not impressed with the looks. Expecially not the camera bump on the back. The overall look just doesn't do it for me. At the $399 price, the A9 seems pretty sweet considering what I'm changing from. Nice build and looks, marshmallow with responsive UI and a much imporoved camera.\nI don't have any issue with reviewers saying don't buy this expecting a flagship but it's a worthy phone if you're coming from an N5 or older/cheaper midrange.

Thoughts?", "thread": [{"postID": "post4777205", "text": "So, it seems like $399 was only a promotional price. $499 is the actual price of the phone.\nHere are my thoughts.HTC is a company in tough times. They desperately need to turn things around or close its doors. Unfortunately, they seem to have not thought things through.The HTC One A9 is actually a capable phone. Packing somewhat decent hardware wrapped up in a polarizing but very premium design and great software. However, it's initial price of $399 was a bit tough as it was up in competition against some other phones, many of which pack punchier hardware on paper, like the Moto X Pure Edition, ASUS Zenfone 2 Deluxe, Nextbit Robin, Nexus 5X and even the OnePlus Two.\nThe $499 MSRP is actually a huge mistake, as that puts it in the territory of the Samsung Galaxy S6, LG G4, Nexus 6P and other flagships launched earlier this year. \nIMHO, the phone should have been $299 or somewhere around that mark. It's hard for HTC to make premium phones at affordable prices, but a phone that has weaker specs on paper compared to another phone at the same price just isn't gonna sell. I'm sorry, but that's the harsh reality. The non-techie consumers don't know what software optimization is. They just look at the spec sheet and buy the phone that has the strongest hardware and one with more features than the other.", "time": "10-27-2015 09:07 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4798448", "text": "Certainly a deal breaker, especially with the small battery and poor battery life as reviewed.", "time": "11-02-2015 09:35 PM", "replies": []}]}, {"postID": "post4777532", "text": "They clearly said on launch day the $399 price was a temporary promotional price. $499 isn't a bad price if you consider the competition - the new Sony Xperia's are $695 and $650; The Nexus 5X is $380, but it's plastic.
