The battery lasts quite awhile for me. I did not buy this phone for Tango so I have only even tried one app for a few minutes. I can say this phone is definitely faster than the Nexus and every other phone I've had(Nexus 6, Moto X Pure, HTC One M8, Galaxy S3, Iphone 4). Rapid charge works great and it works with the rapid chargers I had for the Moto X Pure. Pics are OK, nothing special. I am not a big photo enthusiast so it's fine.

I used to think \"Why do I need a fingerprint scanner???\" But now that I've had one I absolutely love it and it works flawlessly on this phone. \nA few things concern me. \n1. Audio Lag, when watching Youtube videos there is a definite audio lag. Netflix sometimes has a little lag and then sometimes its fine. I don't use my phone to watch videos that often so it hasn't bothered me as much as it probably should. Have only seen 2 others on the Lenovo forums with the same problem, no fix yet. If you turn off Dolby Atmos it gets better and sometimes fixes it for a bit. I have yet to try a factory reset, but others have with no Joy. I have not experienced any lag in games. \n2. Cases, there is a lack of cases for this phone. Basically there are 2 choices, a real thin TPU case that doesn't even have a lip to protect the screen and then a folding style case. I have the folding style case so at least there is some protection for the screen. \n3. Updates, I fear that updates will be few and far between for this phone. I will be amazed if it gets Nougat.
