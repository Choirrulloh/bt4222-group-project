Personally, I think this is pure lamesauce. 2015 flagships have already received their respective Nougat updates and while the OnePlus 2 can be considered a mid-priced device due to its $329 - $389 pricetag, its hardware still makes it the flagship of OnePlus at the time. Adding insult to injury is how OnePlus promised 2 years of support previously. With support for the OP2 pretty much ending on Marshmallow and the inconsistent release of security patches, this really is quite a mess.\nAnother thing is that on the aforementioned Q&A, the rep actually said clearly that the update is in fact coming. While it is not a direct promise, it does somewhat count in a way, which brings me to say this;Please do not promise stuff you can't deliver.With that out of the way, if you own a OnePlus 2 and have no desire to upgrade to a OnePlus 3T or 5, the XDA forums will have a Nougat firmware to flash, although note that because they're based on the Marshmallow kernel, full stability and other stuff like camera quality can't be guaranteed.", "time": "06-11-2017 01:57 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5847571", "text": "Agreed.

But annoying. I'm sure it's from the 810 being clocked down to help prevent overheating issues. \n2. Heat\nI can't tell the difference if one gets hotter than the other. \n3. Screen\nBoth have amazing screens. And too be honest. I prefer a 1080 screen so the GPU doesn't have to push so many intense pixels. So I keep more memory for actual day to day use. \n4. AUX sound\nWe all know the N6 external speakers can get very loud. And the OP2 speakers are weak. But the OP2 AUX sound is incredible. (based on headphones of course) but when comparing the OP2 sounded better with the same headphones (skull candy) plus the audio tweaks you get are a nice touch. \n5. Camera\nI was so excited for the OP2 camera. But I must say.... I'm disappointed. The camera app launches quick, but it's too easy to get blurry photos. The N6 camera was better at quick photos and not being blurry. (still not perfect either) but that phone is a year old now and I feel took better photos than the OP2. I do enjoy the OP2 video though. I like the slow MO and time lapse. It performs well overall. I'm really looking forward to an update for the camera. \n6. Being a phone\nCall quality is great. Phone on the ear feels better than the N6. But I (feel) like the OP2 has a weaker signal. When at my friends (dead zone) I was on emergency calls only. But the N6 with the same size will get around one bar and edge.\n(edit) I realized on t-mobile, my apn was set to a standard metro PCS, I switched to fast t-mobile Lte. So the signal could improve. Will update later. \nBut the OP2 performs much better when texting. N6 would get bogged down when texting multiple people at once and the OP2 is smooth and fast. Loving the SwiftKey keyboard. \nThose are some of my big comparisons. I hope this helps what people think. I know there is no such thing as a perfect phone, but as of now... I really into this phone and can live with the problems. It's a great overall phone and plan on keeping it. I am interested in seeing what oneplus does with oxygen OS and future updates. It can only get better.", "time": "08-31-2015 09:50 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5048016", "text": "As OP2 has fingerprint and Nexus 6 doesn't made me to buy the Op2.

I was assured it was an approved usb cable to work with my nexus 6P so I bit the bullet.\n2.

Nothing fancy really included other than the usual warranty card and boxing.\n3: Product stability - While I'm not a huge wire expert or such the usb cable is a thich gauge which in my understanding will withstand use! I've used thin wiring USBs before and they are awful! They wear out quick. This wire so far on my only usb type c device has worked wonderful without issue. I got the 2 meter option one. The power unit itself is your average size power unit. I'm glad they didn't go with the L shape unit because those are annoying to fit in a compact bag or let alone your pants (OUCH!).

It's the US version purchased with an invite. I installed the OTA update right away and then performed a factory reset before I started setting everything up.\nI'm very impressed so far. I wasn't a fan of the OnePlus One because the software was very buggy and the screen had a yellow tint across the bottom.\nFortunately, I have only encountered a few issues so far, which is about 20 issues less than I had with the OnePlus One. One is that the ProShot camera app won't launch on this phone, but that could be caused by a bug in the app. \nThe second issue, which might be my biggest issue with the phone so far, is that the hardware home button is very finicky. It was missing so many of my taps that I had to switch to on-screen navigation buttons. Some people have suggested pressing it like a physical button instead of just using a light tap, but even that didn't always work for me. This could be a grounding issue that isn't fixable with a software update as the home button seems to work better if you aren't touching the metal side or your hands are damp, but it's hard to say. I have seen quite a few others reporting the same thing.\nThe final issue is that the speaker just isn't very loud or full sounding. Definitely worse than the Galaxy S6 and G4, and far worse than the One M8 and Nexus 6. It's about on the level of the Nexus 5.\nSo those are my negatives, but there's definitely a lot more things to like about this phone than to dislike.\nThe build quality is great. Very premium feeling.\nThe side bezels are small and the back is rounded and grippy (if you use the sandstone back anyways) so the phone doesn't feel very big and is easy to hold despite having a 5.5 inch screen.\nSpeaking of the screen, it's phenomenal. I haven't been able to test sunlight visibility yet, but the contrast is good, the color temperature is somewhat cool, yet not too cool, and the color calibration is near perfect. I haven't seen colors this accurate on an Android phone before. Comparing side by side with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the colors look identical, which is good as Apple displays are known for their color accuracy.\nI've had no issues with heat. In fact, I haven't even felt the phone get warm, even when it was installing all of my apps.\nThe phone is very fast too. It boots and installs apps MUCH faster than my Nexus 6, and everything runs smoothly. Definitely smoother than the Galaxy S6 and G4, and about the same as the Nexus 5 and 6.\nOxygen OS doesn't have as many customization options and features as Cyanogen OS, but the features it does have feel more polished. I love the dark theme. I selected orange for the accent color and love the look. I think going away from Cyanogen and hiring members of the Paranoid Android team were both good moves.\nI haven't don't much testing of the camera, but a couple indoor shots I took looked good, better than my Nexus 6 and probably better than my Galaxy S6. The only issue was that there was a small delay between pressing the shutter button and the photo being taken, but that will probably be improved with a software update. The good news is that the camera2 API is implemented. In the Manual Camera app, I could adjust ISO (up to 800), shutter speed (up to 1/2 sec), focus, and color temperature (precise K adjustments), but there is no RAW support.Update 1 (August 27):\nI took a few outdoor photos before work this morning. My initial impression is that the camera is pretty good, but definitely a step below the best smartphone cameras like the Galaxy S6. It's probably about on the level of the Nexus 6. Colors and white balance look pretty accurate in auto mode, dynamic range is good, and sharpness is very good at the center of the photo. However, sharpness trails off rapidly near the edges of photos, more so than other smartphones I've used recently, and HDR does a good job of brightening shadows, but it can make colors look oversaturated and fake, especially green plants.\nI should probably mention that Wi-Fi, LTE, and Bluetooth all seem to be working as expected so far.\nFinally, there is one feature I want to mention because it annoys me. When you swipe down on the top right side of the screen, the phone pulls down the quick toggles, skipping past the notifications. Swiping down on the top left side of the screen pulls down your notifications as normal. The problem is, when using the phone one handed, I am always pulling down the quick toggles when I'm just trying to see my notifications because my thumb can't really reach across to the top left of the screen easily. I really hope they add a toggle to turn this feature off.Update 2 (August 27):\nIt's almost noon here and I just got my first chance to view the phone in bright sunlight. There isn't a cloud in the sky and the sun is almost directly overhead. I'm thrilled to report that the screen gets extremely bright and is easily readable in direct sunlight. I had the screen set to 100% brightness with adaptive brightness enabled. It was far easier to read in direct sunlight than my Nexus 6, my LG G4, and seemed about as bright as the Galaxy S6 in it's sunlight boost mode. Several reviews I read, including Android Central's, docked the screen for not being very bright or easily visible in sunlight. I'm wondering, did they not remove the screen protector that came on the phone (as I did), and did that cause some unruly reflections? Or did those reviewers get pre-final or defective hardware? I don't know, but my experience is completely different than what Android Central reported.Update 3 (August 31):\nAfter using the phone for a few more days, I've discovered a few more issues with apps that I use regularly. There's a chance that these issues are caused by bugs in the apps themselves, but I didn't experience any of these issues on my Nexus 6 so I think they're actually caused by some bugs in Oxygen OS. In Google Messenger, incoming messages are occasionally placed in a new thread instead of in an existing thread. Also in Google Messenger, threads occasionally come back after deleting them. In Pocket Casts, resuming a podcast after it's been paused for an extended period of time often results in the app losing it's place and restarting the podcast from the beginning. Finally, Google Maps Navigation simply won't rotate to a different orientation than it was launched in unless I leave the app, rotate the phone, and then return to the app.\nAlso, I can speak about battery life now. To put it simply, it's good, but not amazing. It easily beats the Galaxy S6, and is a little better than the Nexus 6 and G4, but it's still possible to kill it in a single day if you do a lot with it. I'm getting around 4 hours of screen on time in a 16 hour day with about 20% left to spare with everything syncing and a Moto 360 connected, but I'm on Wi-Fi most of the day.\nLastly, I had a chance to compare my OnePlus 2 to another OnePlus 2 and found a couple disappointing discoveries. First, the screen on the other OnePlus 2 had a noticeably warmer tint, and the color temperature was a little uneven too with the bottom of the screen being slightly warmer than the top. It was nowhere near as bad as the yellow tint across the bottom of my OnePlus One, but it's worth noting that there seems to be some variance between screens. Second, earlier in the review I mentioned that sharpness trails off rapidly near the edges of photos, meaning there is some blurring on the sides and corners of my photos. I'll attach a photo below so you can see what I'm talking about. Well, the second OnePlus 2 took photos that were sharp across nearly the entire frame, so apparently the blurring at the edges of my photos is just a defect with my OnePlus 2. Well, less like a defect and more like a high variance in quality. So one OnePlus 2 has a less than perfect screen with uneven color temperature, and the other has a less than perfect camera that blurs photos at the edges. I'm guessing the low cost of this phone means there is less quality control and more variance in quality between different units. That's unfortunate. If you get a perfect OnePlus 2, I think it's probably one of the best phones you can buy, but I wonder how hard it is to get a perfect OnePlus 2. Out of the two I've seen, each one had an issue with the hardware. \nPhoto showing blurring in the bottom right corner of the image:", "time": "08-27-2015 10:32 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post4698335", "text": "Any more updates?

There isn't a cloud in the sky and the sun is almost directly overhead. I'm thrilled to report that the screen gets extremely bright and is easily readable in direct sunlight. I had the screen set to 100% brightness with adaptive brightness enabled. It was far easier to read in direct sunlight than my Nexus 6, my LG G4, and seemed about as bright as the Galaxy S6 in it's sunlight boost mode. Several reviews I read, including Android Central's, docked the screen for not being very bright or easily visible in sunlight. I'm wondering, did they not remove the screen protector that came on the phone (as I did), and did that cause some unruly reflections? Or did those reviewers get pre-final or defective hardware?

There's a chance that these issues are caused by bugs in the apps themselves, but I didn't experience any of these issues on my Nexus 6 so I think they're actually caused by some bugs in Oxygen OS. In Google Messenger, incoming messages are occasionally placed in a new thread instead of in an existing thread. Also in Google Messenger, threads occasionally come back after deleting them. In Pocket Casts, resuming a podcast after it's been paused for an extended period of time often results in the app losing it's place and restarting the podcast from the beginning. Finally, Google Maps Navigation simply won't rotate to a different orientation than it was launched in unless I leave the app, rotate the phone, and then return to the app.\nAlso, I can speak about battery life now. To put it simply, it's good, but not amazing. It easily beats the Galaxy S6, and is a little better than the Nexus 6 and G4, but it's still possible to kill it in a single day if you do a lot with it. I'm getting around 4 hours of screen on time in a 16 hour day with about 20% left to spare with everything syncing and a Moto 360 connected, but I'm on Wi-Fi most of the day.\nLastly, I had a chance to compare my OnePlus 2 to another OnePlus 2 and found a couple disappointing discoveries. First, the screen on the other OnePlus 2 had a noticeably warmer tint, and the color temperature was a little uneven too with the bottom of the screen being slightly warmer than the top. It was nowhere near as bad as the yellow tint across the bottom of my OnePlus One, but it's worth noting that there seems to be some variance between screens. Second, earlier in the review I mentioned that sharpness trails off rapidly near the edges of photos, meaning there is some blurring on the sides and corners of my photos. I'll attach a photo below so you can see what I'm talking about. Well, the second OnePlus 2 took photos that were sharp across nearly the entire frame, so apparently the blurring at the edges of my photos is just a defect with my OnePlus 2. Well, less like a defect and more like a high variance in quality. So one OnePlus 2 has a less than perfect screen with uneven color temperature, and the other has a less than perfect camera that blurs photos at the edges. I'm guessing the low cost of this phone means there is less quality control and more variance in quality between different units. That's unfortunate. If you get a perfect OnePlus 2, I think it's probably one of the best phones you can buy, but I wonder how hard it is to get a perfect OnePlus 2. Out of the two I've seen, each one had an issue with the hardware. \nPhoto showing blurring in the bottom right corner of the image:", "time": "08-31-2015 10:34 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4654120", "text": "Lulz.

OnePlus' wrangling with Cyanogen and the somewhat spotty performance of OxygenOS (compared to CM12) is also a concern. Still, I was excited for this announcement until I looked at the details. There are a number of glaring flaws that throw the \"Never Settle\" idea completely out the door. In particular:No NFC - I can't imagine how anybody can ignore this feature with the popularity of Apple Pay and Google Wallet. With chip-and-pin becoming a required feature for credit card processing, people are going to be even more inclined to want to use their devices. OnePlus is targeted squarely at the enthusiast community who is probably the #1 user of this feature. Dropping it makes no sense whatsoever.No wireless charging - Not even as an option? Again, something that is billed as a \"flagship killer\" is going to take a lot of hits from the charging features on other devices.No Fast Charging - The battery life on the One is great, but with the new 810 processor and a smaller battery, I don't think this one is going to be even in the same league. A flagship killer shouldn't need to be plugged before the end of a full day.No QHD Display - Initial descriptions of the high contrast 1080p panel are encouraging, but with phones in the same price range starting to get QHD displays it makes this somewhat difficult to get behind. The phone has 4GB of RAM, which would be ideal for the higher resolution display.\nThis all comes in the light of the Moto X Pure Edition announced the same day that hits pretty much every spec out-of-the-park in comparison (fingerprint reader not withstanding). This from a company that doesn't require you to use a silly invite system, has a good track record for customer service, and even lets you customize at the factory. At a similar price-point, the OnePlus Two is hardly in the same class.\nIn conclusion.

It barely had any rivals in its price class and its closest rivals specs-wise were phones like the Samsung Galaxy S5, LG G3, HTC One M8, Sony XPERIA Z2 and others, and those phones cost $600+ when new, whilst the OPO was around the $300 mark when it was new, making it tremendous value-for-money. It does have its caveats, like the questionable marketing of the company and the invite system, which we still dislike to this day.\nThe Two is going to be way tougher to sell. That's because what the OPO also did was also give notice to other smartphone OEMs to create smartphones that pack flagship power for a midrange price, especially Motorola and ASUS, who have responded with the Moto X Style and Zenfone 2 ZE551ML 64GB respectively. The X Style is $399 for the base model and the Zenfone 2 is $299 for the 64GB model and $199 for the base model. That puts the OPT smack bang in the middle, at $329 for 16GB and $389 for 64GB.\nHowever, why I said that it's a tougher sell is because the 2 devices offer more than what the OPT has. Both have support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, NFC and several OEM features like Moto Assist and some ASUS stuff. The most important part, however, is that these phones can be purchased outright and you can have it on the same day you've purchased the device if you didn't purchase the device online, unlike the OPT, which has the invite system from the OPO and the wait times are still questionably long, due to the way their referral system allows people to jump the queue by thousands of people.", "time": "08-04-2015 05:21 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post4589742", "text": "I feel that the moto x play will be better than one plus 2 in many areas.

It also provides an orderly method like a queue, basically a \"first come, first serve\" method, where the first to come is the first to be served, unless that person may have made a reservation. It's not as good as buying a phone outright in the conventional way, but in theory, an invite should make things orderly.\nSadly, the way OnePlus has handled it is nothing like how I mentioned. You basically get a spot, but you're not guaranteed that spot. So let's say you're in a pool of 100,000 guys and you're in spot #1500. You've got that early spot and everyone else is late. One day later, you're at spot #15,000, because some guys behind you managed to spam referral links in other places. The next day, you're at spot #50,000.\nI personally think that the whole referral system is making this whole invite system pretty messy and I would personally either buy an invite off someone or the phone itself off Swappa (might be used). Personally, it's not worth my time to be sitting in front of a computer and keep sending referral links to maintain my place in the queue.

Golfdriver also made an excellent point that for a phone that is being actively marketed as a \"2016 Flagship Killer\", omitting even flagship basics like quick charging and NFC is somewhat odd and seems to be more of a cost-cutting measure. \nI'd also like to make a stand on his statement on Android Pay. If what he said is true about the last part about Android Pay being adopted widely in a year from now and that people would've changed phones then, that's kinda contradicting what OnePlus said about futureproofing the OPT with a Type-C port. It sounds like he's implying that the OPT is only going to be used by users for only a year before they change phones. That's hardly futureproofing to me.\nI'm in no way attempting to bash the OnePlus Two, since it's still a good phone for a nice deal at $389 for 64GB, but whatever he said is questionable to me.\nHonestly, I have to say that with all the new batch of phones that pack in flagship punch for midrange money like the ASUS Zenfone 2 ZE551ML 64GB, Motorola Moto X Style 2015 and possibly the upcoming Nexus 5 2015, looks like the OnePlus Two is going to be an even tougher sell.

I honestly thought the One looked better. The front looked pretty good but the camera placement on the back is just soft-of...odd.Lack of NFC. While OnePlus did state that not many OPO users use NFC, I felt like this came at a bad time. A time when Android Pay is gonna roll out. And while not many users might care about NFC, me just thinking how a cheaper Zenfone 2 has it makes it pretty weird IMHO.No Quick Charge 2.0 support. While many people could care about a rat's patoon rather than having QC, I felt like unless you charge your phone at night before bed, this might be an issue, especially if you're a really heavy user who ends up in the middle of the day with low battery. QC 2.0 apparently works with USB Type C as well.What I'm not sure aboutQualcomm Snapdragon 810. So far, I haven't heard of any overheating horror stories, but if the reports of the downclocking of the A57 clusters to 1.8GHz are true and if that 49k Antutu score is final, then I would say that it might have been more logical to step back to a Snapdragon 808, mainly to improve power efficiency. Not to mention the reputation of the 810 is getting more and more troubled, even to some regular customers.Wireless charging. I would've labelled this in the \"Stuff I didn't like section\", but I'm not big on it, so it's here.\nWould I call this the 2016 flagship killer? No.\nI think that's an overused term and personally, I would prefer to call it \"A phone with flagship performance without the flagship price\" since it does do a lot of things a flagship could and performs nearly as well as one.", "time": "07-28-2015 08:12 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 & qi", "thread": [{"postID": "post4577267", "text": "Hi can't find mention of this.
