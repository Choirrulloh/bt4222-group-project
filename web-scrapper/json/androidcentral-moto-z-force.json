I've cleared the cache and the partition cache and neither have helped.\nThank you!", "time": "02-28-2018 06:39 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post6175811", "text": "Does this also happen in Safe Mode? https://motorola-global-portal.custh...p/30,6720,9833", "time": "03-01-2018 11:03 AM", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "How-to: Fix \"Your device has failed verification and may not work properly\" message on boot error", "thread": [{"postID": "post5597623", "text": "I rarely reboot my device so I don't know when this error started happening.

Zagg is kind of pricey but through trial and error over the past couple years, it seems they do make a pretty good product and they are good with precise fits too. Verizon surprisingly had one left in stock when I initially was going to get the Force through them. As soon as I left Best Buy, I went straight to Verizon and got the Zagg and the Blue Incipio mod. The sales rep I could tell wasn't too happy since they are on some type of commission but Best Buy offering $99 two year contract and a free JBL Mod was ten times better than what Verizon offered. Verizon was around $200 two year contract and no free JBL. Best Buy typically has some pretty good deals.

My biggest gripe and not waiting on the note 5 is no SD card slot. I'm not interested in down grading to sg7.\nLong story short, my other half picked up the black moto z force because his HTC m8 was going down hill. I got the white/gold one. Verizon Corp stores have a special, buy one moto z force get the other one 50% off. Plus $300 trade in credit on his HTC m8 towards a new phone. Basically, we are getting two moto z force's for a hair more than what would cost monthly for one. It was a no brainer. I would get my SD card slot back and I could pay off what I owe on the phone anytime when the note 8 arrives next year if I don't like/enjoy the device.\nI'm not too bad of a Samsung butt lover so don't give me too much crap. I really love the camera and spen. I hate touchwiz with a passion.\nAnyhow, about my dislikes on the moto z force: it's a slippery phone. I had the moto turbo 2 and loved how it felt in the hand. So, I am looking for at least the JBL speaker moto mod or a different back plate with the bumper.\nSecond, the camera really sucks in low lighting or when not using the flash with bad lightning. I was really hoping moto was gonna update this from the turbo 2. I feel they would really corner the market and be up there to be an apple/Sammy killer. Why didn't they fix this. I try my best with other 3rd party camera/photo apps out on the market.\nThird, why not Miracast? You can only mirror your phone with Chromecast right now. I'm hoping this will be fixed in a future update as I did research this in other forums. I mirror a lot on my Roku. For now, it looks like I'll be buying a Chromecast stick until the fix comes. Sighs.\nThere's other little things but nothing I can't get use to like the mia notification light. Too bad they don't even give you the option of firing off the flash for notifications in the accessibility menu.\nWhat I love about the phone is the vanilla Android os. If moto does one thing right, it's this. They give you the ability to customize your phone with no rooting. I'm a big fan of Nova Prime and it continues to run smooth on the motos.\nSecond, the ability to have the SD card slot back. Yes, Sammy brought this back in the sg7 lines but I want a note series phone with the spen.\nThe battery is fabulous! I don't need to say more about that. You all know.\nAnd lastly I'm looking forward to using a bumper with the moto mods and different back plates. Again, anything to play around with customizing is a plus for me.\nThanks for reading! \ud83d\ude00", "time": "10-24-2016 06:13 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5518819", "text": "Regarding volume levels and notifications, I bought my Z Force this past Saturday.

It still blinks on and off anytime a new notification from any app comes in, so if you keep your phone close or handy all the time, it's really not all that different than before. If you like to set your phone down and keep it further away, then the lack of breathing is more problematic, but then that was never as good as an LED light regardless. My only issue at this point is really on principle. It seems like it would be pretty easy to make this a customizable feature, allowing the user to choose how many times or how long the notifications breathe for. The system itself in my opinion is still the best of any manufacturer.

But I do have some complaints, the speaker needs to have a grill over it, I'm in construction and it gets sawdust from being in my pocket. The USB C port needs to be able to be removed without having to return the phone. Make it a true Moto mod and make pieces interchangeable so you can replace them without losing your phone for the day. The screen unbreakable is awesome. So far I own all the mods. Most useful is the speaker and the batteries but all are awesome. I don't like when using the projector you may not be able to use it when streaming a video due to copyright of the video. I'm on my third Moto Z Force. First one would not hold the power cable when plugged in. The second was from the speaker being blown out possibly from debris inside the speaker port. We'll see how this one goes. I wish the Hasselblad camera came with a macro feature or interchangeable lenses. I would like a belt clip that would work with the screen facing your belt, so I could clip on to a belt when mods are Attached. The 360 camera is awesome, I am able to provide clients with a 360 view of progress of jobs. The storage of videos with the 360 camera is lacking, the memory it needs to store the videos needs to be substantially larger in the cloud without having to buy extra cloud space the mod itself should have a micro SD card slot. I eagerly await terabytes of micro SD cards to be available. Yes the phone itself is light and the mods are heavy but there are always sacrifices when asking it to do something that's not the norm. Yes it does get hot while charging. But I have never had the screen go black from sitting on my dashboard to Long. That's just amazing. I just had my Moto Z-Force a year and my warranty is expiring. Let's make the warranty much much longer. If the screen is invincible why not just make the phone lifetime warranty. Buying all these mods and then having to replace the phone is it just a silly way to make more money. Make money on interesting mods and give away the phone. They already pretty much give away computers why does a phone have to cost so much when it's only part of the package. The fingerprint scanner works awesome but it would be nice to be a home screen button or something else. The bezel next to the home screen button could have other features to be determined. Possibly a one-handed Mouse when the screen is large, possibly a small display so you could have notifications when watching a video...etc...I'm hoping for a Qi storage case with its own battery and AC plug, so when the mods are not in use or partially charged I could just put them in the case and they will automatically charge whether the case is plugged in the wall or not.", "time": "08-10-2017 10:02 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5924115", "text": "Ive owned many smartphones over the years, started with the Droid 1, went to the iPhone for a bit, had the Thunderbolt (bad idea), more Droids, Samsung GS7 Edge, notes, you name it.

Like a lot of you I'm sure, I've been watching the fall phone releases pretty closely. \nIt's tempting to change, especially since I moved a couple of years ago to buying phones outright and reselling them to make it easier to change when I wanted to. \nI want a large screen, battery life, top performing camera, and fast/not laggy software - and don't want to pay top dollar. I also use Verizon.. potentially willing to swtich but still prefer phones that work on all four US carriers for resale value.\nThis year is unlike other years - no phone is the clear cut best for me. \nAll the new phones have things that are awesome, but all have at least one major flaw as well. With prices rising as they have, none of them seem worth it.\n1. Pixel 2 XL - mediocre screen, high price, already more reports of bluetooth reliability being poor (but awesome everything else)\n2. LG VX30 - screen, laggy software (quad DAC, great camera)\n3. Note 8 - $#%^ expensive, laggy software (but awesome camera)\n4. Razer phone - unproven camera, no CDMA (but big battery.. and camera could be ok)\n5. Mate 10 Pro - crappy software (but the HW looks awesome)\n6. HTC U11+ - looks near perfect, but not sold in US (why didn't Google go with this phone for the 2 XL?)\n7. OnePlus 5T - could be great, but the camera needs to be better, still no CDMA\n8. Essential PH-1 - terrible camera (but awesome HW, fast stock SW, and a currently good value price)\n9. iPhone 8 Plus - expensive, like being able to customize the experience on Android, camera not the best anymore\nSo, with all that said, I decided to just stick with the Z Force. the moto power pack for just $38 to make sure the phone lasts a day (I'm a heavy user so battery life had already degraded). Reformatted to improve performance and stability.. and with just those changes I'm reminded of how much I like this phone. Moto does a great job with software and radios, which are often undervalued.

One of my other favorite Motorola phones was the original Droid Turbo. I actually still love that phone. It was what sold me on Motorola to begin with.

Then, replace the shattershield and put a protector on top of the new one. A number of people have put tempered glass protectors on, including some ~$10 ones from Amazon.

You could always look for a 3rd party blue light filter in the Play Store.\nRegarding the folders with tiny icons -- do you mean that for folders on the homescreen, you'd like more options for how the app icons are displayed on that folder icon (like grid, fan, stack, etc.)?

Right now it\u2019s averaging 13.5 hours on, 3.5 hours screen on time and that is without a SIM card or cell service. It has a very nice, accurate screen. It\u2019s a very comfortable phone with an excellent form factor as well as front firing speakers. I think the 808 chip does have issues. The phone heats up at times, particularly when turbocharged, which I no longer use. Performance is good, but I never pushed it very hard. Camera is good, although significantly weaker than the Z Force. After the initial Marshmallow update that was very quick, security updates have been few and far between and the phone still has not been updated to Nougat. \nForm Factor: It\u2019s certainly not svelte or sleek like an LG G6 or the Samsung S8 or S8+. It would be nice if the bottom bezel were a little smaller. Yet, I only use a bumper case and tempered glass screen protector because this phone is more durable than most because of its metal construction and Shattershield. In fact, I don\u2019t have insurance on the phone and that saves me several dollars a month.\nScreen: It may not quite reach the depths of vibrancy found on Samsung phones, but overall the screen is quite enjoyable, particularly blacks. It can get bright enough as well in full sunlight. The Shattershield is much improved over the Droid Turbo 2 as far as screen quality and brightness. \nPerformance: The phone continues to be very fast and very responsive. Occasionally I do a full cache wipe, but I have yet to do or felt the need to do a full factory reset, even after major system updates. The phone generally does not heat up. I do not play games. Taking photos does heat the phone up. The phone generally does well holding cell and wifi signals. Calls are clear. I don\u2019t listen to music much using headphones so no thoughts there. I enjoy the fingerprint sensor a lot. It is quick and generally quite accurate. \nBattery: Battery life has declined somewhat over time. At one point according to GSAM battery monitor I was averaging 25 hours on, with 6 hours screen on time. I know many have done better than that. But I live in a small town and generally try to keep the phone on 3G. Over time, battery life has decreased to 24 hours on, and 5.5 hours screen on time. I charge the phone when it gets below 40% when possible and not above 80%. I think that has helped somewhat. I sometimes use Pixoff battery app that helps with screen on time. I also use Greenify. Taking photos kills the battery quickly as it does with most phones. \nCamera: I have only used the front camera a few times, so I don\u2019t have an opinion there. The rear camera takes excellent photos overall. I sometimes have trouble with motion shots, but realize I could use the professional mode. Hopefully a two camera setup may improve that in the the 2017 version. Low light photos can be hit or miss. HDR can add a lot to the quality of photos. XDA developers have ported the Pixel camera app to use on the Force and it can improve indoor and low light shots. \nMoto Mods: I have several style shells. I enjoy the novelty of them, but they\u2019re not life-changing. I have the first generation JBL speaker and use it occasionally. It\u2019s a lot of fun. I have the Hasselblad camera mod. When using it for zoom, it definitely is a significant improvement. Otherwise, the Force camera takes better photos, which is a disappointment. What is really unfortunate is that I think the Hasselblad mod should take better photos than it does with better processing. I have the Mophie battery pack. It\u2019s somewhat bulky and could be grippier, but otherwise works well. \nUpdates: The phone was updated to Nougat very quickly. Security updates have been consistent and timely. It will be interesting to see when the phone is updated to O (Oreo) and if that will be the last major update, which I assume it will be. \nComparisons with other phones: I haven\u2019t had any of the other 2016 or 2017 phones to compare with the Z Force. Yet, I probably would be happier with this phone over the Pixel and Samsung S7 edge. \nBottom Line: I\u2019ve been very happy with the Z Force. Hopefully I will keep it for a second year before upgrading in 2018 with likely another Z Force if it meets my needs and preferences.", "time": "06-28-2017 10:22 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5866486", "text": "As a side note; I have been letting my 5 year old use the Moto Z Force as a mini tablet (unbreakable? screen FTW!).

I'm one of the many Note 7 refugees looking for a new device after years of Samsung fanboy devotion. I had every Note other than the original and never thought I could live without the Spen. I went with the moto Z Force and I'm happy with its performance. I had the opportunity to pick up a Pixel XL for basically nothing, so I did. Now I must compare them and I'll be handing one down to my youngest daughter. \nScreen:\nPixel is a bit better, but only noticeable to me when holding them side by side, both are very good. \nFPS:\nPersonal preference, I like it on the front much better than the back. Edit: as I spend more time with the Pixel, I've come to dislike the sensor on the back quite a bit. \nSpeed:\nIf there is a difference, I can't tell. Both are very fast and smooth. \nBattery:\nBoth seem about the same. I can get through a normal day without looking for a charge. I have been getting over 4 hours SOT from each in a 10 to 12-hour day. \nPhotos:\nPixel is very, very fast to take the photo. If you have small children running around you're attempting to photograph, the Pixel is your only choice between these two. \nAs far as photo quality and lighting conditions go, I've taken a few photos in different lighting to compare. \nThe moto Z Force and Pixel XL both take good photos for the most part. As expected, lighting plays a big factor in the outcome. I have added notes to a few of the photos to explain the color variations. In some cases, the difference is extreme. The Pixel tends to be closer to true color and a little flat or washed out at times while the moto seems to look a bit more vibrant but over saturated in some cases. So, personal taste, of course, is a big factor here. \nIn the following photos, first shot is Moto Z Force followed by the Pixel XL. \nThe moto adjust very well to the lighting. The Pixel XL is more accurate, but is that a good thing in this situation? \nMoto photo shows an awesome red in the side of this one, but there is no red on the car. Pixel is much more accurate. \nBoth look great, but the car is orange. \nThe reds seem better in the moto and the blacks in the Pixel XL. \nBoth look good, hard to tell much difference to me. \nBoth look good, I think the moto with its rich color looks better in this situation. \nIn this situation the red is more accurate in the moto shot, the Pixel looks dull or flat to me. \nFeel in hand:\nBoth are good to me. The Pixel seems a lot more like the Z with style shell. The Z Force is a bit thicker when you have a moto style shell installed. But if you're like most, you'll be putting a case on the Pixel XL, which makes it about the same as the Z Force. If you go naked, you'll probably like the Pixel better. I put a TPU case on both and can't tell much difference. \nBuild Quality:\nAlthough I believe both are well built, I prefer the moto. I'm very partial to the Z Force having the ShatterShield and Style Shell. I have the leather and red nylon style shells. Not sure why anyone would want a glass or aluminum back, neither would be my first choice. \nThe ShatterShield gives a piece of mind you just can't get otherwise. It's a big deal to me personally. \nAndroid Auto:\nThe Z Force hooked up to my 2016 Chevrolet Silverado first try and every time after that without issue and has worked great with all the features. \nThe Pixel XL has been glitchy each time I've tried to connect. It will connect one time and then not connect several times afterwards. Requires disconnecting the cable a few times and even a reboot once. Edit: Pixel has settled in and is now connecting with Android Auto like it should. Not sure why it wanted to fight with me to start with, but seems to have given up and is responding as you would expect.\nBluetooth:\nZ Force has connected perfectly each time. Both to my truck and to my LG Tone Plus headset. \nPixel XL connects to headset without any problems, but it has been difficult getting it to connect as easily and stay connected to my truck. \nNougat seems to be a bit less stable in both Bluetooth and Android Auto. \nOther:\nFor some reason my Pixel will not install the Verizon \"out of the box\" update for a Wi-Fi issue it is supposed to have. I spoke with Google support and they connected me to Verizon support. Google support pretty much just passed me along to Verizon, which is fair, after all it is a Verizon update. I went through level one support with Verizon quick (I'd already done everything including a factory reset) and moved on to level two. Although both Verizon support agents were very friendly, I'm now waiting on further instructions. \nI'm not knocking the Pixel for this. It's more likely to be a Verizon issue and I've not experienced any Wi-Fi issues. The update is not available if the Verizon SIM is not installed. \nOther Considerations: (pros/cons) \nZ Force - ShatterShield, battery mod, style shell, front fps (after a few days, rear fps is almost a deal breaker for me) \nPixel - direct updates, camera speed, slightly better display \nMy summary:\nBoth are smooth and fast. So it comes down to what is most important to you. I'll be keeping my Moto Z Force and handing the Pixel XL down to one of my daughters. Both are very good but the advantages of the Z Force are more important to me, making the moto my choice.", "time": "11-03-2016 07:27 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5544378", "text": "Great review!", "time": "11-03-2016 08:29 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5544393", "text": "Awesome review and I too had the Pixel.

The truck is red, correct?", "time": "11-03-2016 09:21 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5544465", "text": "Nice review. \nRegarding that first shot, look at the sky. The Z Force really missed it (also, it's less warm than the Pixel.) Also, the one with the white Mercedes on the black and white floor - I like the Pixel version more. Less contrast (or more exposed?), you can see more detail in the blacks, easier to see the signs in the back. I agree with you on the other photos. \nThis is picking nits, though. Key thing though: both cameras are more than good enough.", "time": "11-03-2016 09:24 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5544466", "text": "Good job!", "time": "11-03-2016 09:25 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5544467", "text": "Truck is red, lighting is from a street light behind me. The light does cast a yellowish color. It is fairly true to color, take a look at the sky, it has a better detail and color than the Z Force.

(I have too much time on my hands, LOL.)\nIn the picture of the truck on the driveway it's obvious the Z Force is cranking up the ISO to get a better exposure. As was mentioned, this blows out the sky detail and also obliterates the body seam of the front door running up the windshield pillar. The tree behind the telephone pole looks bluish in the Force photo. I know you said there was a yellow cast to the light, but the Pixel looks excessively yellow. Would you say the actual yellow hue was somewhere between the two photos, or was the Pixel accurate? Note you can read SILVERADO in the Force shot, not so easy to do in the Pixel shot.\nThe photo of the two door coupe with flames looks better in the Z Force shot, colors are punchier all around (check out the green on the car in the background, for example.) But as you say, it's not exactly accurate. More eye pleasing, for sure (Samsung Galaxy cameras make a living in this space!)\nIn the picture with the hot rod take a look at the air hose dispenser's base where it says \"Drink Coca-Cola\". The larger 21MP shooter of the Z Force allows you to read it clearly, not so much on the Pixel. But, as noted the color is inaccurate. (BTW, red is the hardest color for phones to reproduce accurately.)\nSimilarly, look at the photo of the 1960(?) Chevrolet Impala. You can clearly read the C H E V R O L E T across the front of the hood, the edges of the tread on the sidewall of the Lexus next to it, the Dodge Hwy. sign on the wall behind the Impala, as well as the Welcome to Truckville sign further down the wall. But the white in the Crystal Automotive sign on the wall and the white on the white storage totes are blown out in the Z Force photo.\nThe photo of the Harley is a clear winner for the Pixel. It has better contrast and \"shine\". Again, though, you can see more detail in the Z Force photo (look at Chopper Blvd. sign on the wall.)\nThe picture of the white Mercedes is better with the Z Force. It lacks the \"shine\" of the Pixel, but it's in better focus. I can tell the Camaro has a 350 engine in it by looking at the front fender, can't see that in the Pixel shot. Look at the clarity of the headlamp and the blinker on the Cobra in the Z Force shot vs. the Pixel. Also, check out the round, hanging, overhead lights, especially the one in the far left of the picture. In the Pixel shot they are quite blurry, not so in the Z Force shot. Could be slight hand movement by Connert on this photo, but I thought OIS was supposed to correct that?\nThe shot of the truck by the fence, it looks like the usual properties are reversed--the Z Force shot looks brighter, has more contrast and \"shine\", whereas the Pixel shot is a bit duller and darker. Again, I can clearly read SILVERADO on the side of the door in the Force picture, not so easy in the Pixel shot.\nThanks so much for posting these photos. Tough to decide which is better. For point and shoot in a hurry I guess the Pixel would win out. I suspect the Pixel would win at low light shots, too. But I do like higher detail and the ability to zoom in on areas of the photo by cropping which brings me to the Z Force. I can fix color inaccuracies in photo-editing software. I can't fix loss of detail.", "time": "11-04-2016 11:38 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5545634", "text": "Look at the trees in the background, though. HDR+ on the Pixel must be helping with that, maybe at the cost of detail. I guess it depends on what you like? (Obviously, I look at backgrounds a lot. Also, as I said, I like them both, actually.)\nOne other comparison that would be useful is burst photos. How many can each take in a couple of seconds? Is the 21 MP camera slowing down the ability to write to disk on the Z Force compared with the Pixel? (Or not...) Is the HDR+ taking so long that it affects how many can be burst on the Pixel?

I have a few spots that Verizon struggles to keep me connected and both devices did a good job. I didn't drop any calls and these are the areas I would have lost a call. My Note 7 would almost always drop a call in these locations. \nThe decision for me came down to a couple of personal likes or dislikes. For example, I couldn't wait to get back to my Z Force after a week of trying to get use to the rear mount FPS on the Pixel XL. \nPhoto quality and functionality were the other major differences. Both took great pictures and both struggled at times in my opinion. If you're trying to capture a little one running around the house and that's a major issue in your selection, you're going to want the Pixel XL. It is very fast from the time you open the camera to the time you have taken the photo. It Z Force is no slouch, but can't compare. \nAs for quality, both are very good but different. The Pixel is a bit more true to the situation but I don't think that's always a good thing. If you look back at the photos in the comparison, the early morning shot of my very red truck looks very orange in the Pixel photo and much more true to its red in the Z Force shot. The Pixel photo is more accurate to the situation, but the Z is much more accurate to the subject of the photo. I also personally like the deeper, richer color of the Z Force in the other photos as well. This is all VERY SUBJECTIVE. \nIn the end, I had to go back to the Z Force.

Better contrast, less blown out whites. Inside with average to iffy lighting, the NX app on auto HDR+ or HDR+ on did better at balancing light in shots than the Force camera app on any setting.

Overall the Z force is the better phone spec wise but I can not find that it is IP certified or MIL-STD-810 certified which is important to me because if I drop the phone in a mud puddle or stream, I want it to continue working. I've read some reviews that the Duraforce screen will work while wet which some screens won't and it is suppose to be able to be submerged for up to 30 minutes in 3' of water and it even has the ability to take pictures underwater. The Z force doesn't have a earphone jack so you have to get an adapter to use headphones of other accessories that plug into the jack. I really like the idea of the Moto mods, especially the projector, it would be nice to be able to hang up a sheet and watch a movie while camping but again I worry about how tough or durable this setup would be, what happens if I drop the phone on a rock. For the price of the mod, I could buy a separate mini projector that I'd keep protected until use. The drawback for me on both phones is a removable battery. I have a Casio commando (which is discontinued, too bad) that I really like but it's outdated, slow, and the screen is small but it could take a beating and with it I always carried a spare battery so if I were away for a few days or something like getting lost or an accident happened I had phone power( I know I could carry a power pack of some kind but a spare battery was more convenient for me). There are other tough phones out there with all the stuff I want but unfortunately I'm kind of stuck with Verizon because of a family plan and where I go the coverage sucks for other carriers. \nOne other thing that has kept me from buying a new phone yet is the ability to root the phone. I haven't done enough research on rooting the Moto Z force yet but with the Duraforce pro since it is fairly new and not a real mainstream phone I can't find any thing on a reliable way to root the phone. Can't really comment much about updates but Moto being a more popular phone brand would probably get them faster.\nSo in short the Z is a better spec phone but the Duraforce pro is a tougher phone so it depends on which you want.", "time": "01-22-2017 08:39 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5689786", "text": "To me this is a non-issue since you can use the battery mods exactly like a removable battery would work.

Probably took all of 10 seconds, but by the time I put the protector on, dust had landed on the adhesive side of the protector. :P", "time": "01-16-2017 02:49 PM", "replies": []}]}]}, {"postID": "post5645781", "text": "Thank you so much I appreciate that.

This past fall i was looking at getting a Moto-Z Force and went to the store to buy one. Somehow the verizon salesperson talked me into looking at the Pixel XL. I ended up not buying a phone due to the pushiness of the salesperson and I walked out never looking back. Now my faithful Moto X is starting on its decent to retirement and it is time to finally move on. Verizon has the great deal for $15/month which I am getting ready to jump on before I miss it. I am hoping the Moto-Z will be able to give me a many years of great experiences like my Moto X did. \nA few questions: \n1. I used my Moto X in Ireland on our Honeymoon, i just had to swap an Irish sim card into it. Would I be ale to do the same with the Moto-Z Force as we are planning on returning sometime within the next year or 2?\n2. My office is located in the basement and does not get any cell reception. How well does wifi calling work on this phone? \n3. I was originally thinking of getting an Otterbox, but I am planning on getting the Incipio dual pro case for it instead due to it being much less bulky. Would a tempered glass screen protector work well with the dual pro case and if so, any recommendations on brands?\nI appreciate all assistance and help.", "time": "01-22-2017 08:28 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5653943", "text": "#1 - Not sure, never had to use my Z Force overseas.

I even had TMO for a while due to their wifi calling but their actual reception was terrible anywhere else down here so I had to go back to Verizon.\n#3 - I have the Dual Pro and do not like it. It looks nice and is well made but I find it slippery (I have the red one if it matters). The bevels on the bottom side made it slide in my hands too much and I have pretty big hands. I had no issues at all with a screen protector and the case. I am using the flexible glass protector offered by Verizon as it seems to stick to the Shattershield better without lifting and it also fully covers the entire screen.\nMy favorite case thus far is the Tech21 Evo Check. Buttons are easy to push, offers good protection and it is grippy while still sliding in and out of my front jeans pocket easily. It is not very bulky either.

In full auto mode I would say the Z Force compares very well with the iPhone 7 and is better than the others in overall usage. iPhones still manage to do color balance really well as far as getting it \"correct\". It is not muted nor is it punchy like a Samsung phone. The low light shots are fine for every day use and sharing with the OIS helping a ton. You can get some pretty slow shutter speeds to let in enough light and still have a clear shot if you hold well. \nFrom my usage I would say the Z Force is better than all other than iPhone 7. The 5x was pretty decent but is sloooow, especially with HDR on. The MXPE was just OK even brand new. You could get shots that were OK on FB but dont blow them up at all.

I got an update a few days ago for bug fixes and an android security update. (Software Version: MCL24.246-36.

This feature, amongst other things, allows users to make calls and surf the internet or use the internet for that matter. For example if your using your phone as a hotspot for your laptop and someone calls, you will have to drop the internet connection in order to talk on the phone, unless that feature is activated via MyVerizon App. Its possible that other Verizon specific feature won't work, but this is the only one that I was concerned with. \nWifi calling: I haven't tried using this feature. This may be another feature that needs to be activated via MyVerizon App on the phone in order to use it. \nTo activate you must have a new BYOP sim card from straight talk. You can order the sim from straighttalk.com, walmart.com or go into walmart. I believe if you buy it on the Walmart.com or StraightTalk.com sites you can get the sim for a dollar plus shipping. But if you got into Walmart they bundle the BYOP kit (includes sims for all carriers) but its $15 plus the plan you want ($45 plan or $55 plan).

While I was talking to the Verizon Rep and transferring my 2 numbers from AT&T back to Verizon, I asked her what she was using.

Just got back from the Verizon Store where I played around with the Z Force, Samsung & Edge and iPhone 7+. I made a decision to go with the Moto Z Force.\nSince I have never had an Android device, I would like any suggestions as to what you would do if you were me upon receiving the phone. I read a lot about \"Verizon Bloatware\". I read about getting rid of the Verizon search ware and adding Google's search ware.

When you are connected to the same WIFI, the Android side will show the available 'server' IP addresses. Select the one you want to use and thats it. You can configure the android to be the 'monitor 2', and PowerPoint picked it up and used it as the presentation display perfectly.\nSpacedesk also (it started out with this purpose) will allow you to use a second PC as a second monitor for your computer. So if you have an extra computer/monitor, but your pc only has one monitor plug, you can still get dual monitors.\nIf you have the insta-share, this definitely makes it more worth the price and much more useful.\nMy only suggestion so far on this app, is if they can make it connect thru Bluetooth, so you can do presentations on the insta-share without having to be around a WIFI that you can connect to.https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...spacedesk.beta", "time": "10-25-2016 06:04 PM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5524054", "text": "Cool app find man!

As a former Droid Incredible, Droid Bionic, Droid Razr M and Droid Turbo owner, I am certainly familiar with this line of devices from Big Red. And after picking one up earlier this afternoon at Best Buy, I can say with confidence that the Moto Z Force is no exception. The device itself is impressive for all the reasons listed above. And the mods are truly a game-changer and done right.\nIf I have to complain about anything, it will be the little personalization tricks that Samsung includes in their devices since the SG3. I'm talking about the ability to change the font and themes. I know, it sounds silly. But everytime I felt bored with my Sammy device, a quick switch of the font and the menu colors would instantly give me the impression of a new device in my hand. (Hey, that's just my 2 cents!)\nPS: In my opinion, I would have loved to see Lenovo put the shatter-proof screen and better camera on the regular, thinner Z model. The addition of a batter mod or style mod would then bring the phone to the perfect thickness.

Ironically, I never put too much thought into pictures and took for granted my Notes capabilities apparently. Wasn't until I took some shots on the Moto I realized the noticeable difference. When scrolling through My photo gallery. \nI found myself continuously hitting the finger print scan button on the Moto expecting it to also act as a home screen button. I suppose I would've gotten used to that over time. Found the volume and power buttons to be oddly place and kept inadvertently turning off the screen. Also would've eventually figured that out too. \nI prefer Samsung pay over Android pay. Nice being able to swipe up from any home screen to launch the app. Also, with Samsung pay I can still use it on legacy card readers. I love the look on the cashier's face when he/she tells me \"we don't accept Apple pay.\" my response is \"good thing I have a Samsung\" as my payment is accepted. Also For some reason neither the Verizon sales rep nor I could load my outlook email without having to install the Outlook app. The stock app simply wouldn't accept my login credentials. I absolutely love the stock Samsung calander, its display and the full screen notifications. Not a fan of Google Calendar and found myself in the play store looking for something to replicate the calander. Wanted multi window. As another poster advised that was coming in the next update but knowing Verizon, who knows when that would be and what else Verizon would tack on I'd end up disabling or unable to remove... \nThe absence of a blinking notification light was something I'd miss and wished I had back if I were to keep my moto. Nice being able to see from across the room whether or not I have a new message.\nTouchWiz had a bad rap, deservedly so. It's been scaled back and in my opinion blends well and is very functional. Just found Moto's too bland and would've had to run a 3rd party launcher. With my Note 7 I never considered another launcher (always ran a different launcher on my note 2,3 and 4). \nAll of the above I could have likely lived with but The biggest deal breaker for me was the low earpiece and speaker volume for voice calls, alerts and text messages. I found I needed to position the phone perfectly over my ear to hear a conversation. Also was in zedge looking for loud alert sounds for notifications. While in a restaurant I had to twice step out to hear the caller on the other end. Not used to having to do that. It was possible I had a bad device but figured if that were the case I'd might as well get an S7E if I were going to get another phone. For sure the z is a premium device and the gestures are nice. It's a very comfortable phone to hold knowing the screen is shatter proof! \nHope this doesn't come across as being nitpicky. I really wanted the Moto Z to work for me. Still annoyed with the handling of the Note 7 matter. \nWhile some of the above are personal preferences I believe you should get what works best for you considering the cost of these high end devices.", "time": "10-18-2016 11:42 PM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5504859", "text": "I am glad I read your review.

I find myself trying something and it not working like I expected and then realizing it's because that particular feature was TW not Android. So far it's not really been an issue and I find an easy solution (play store) or workaround that does the same thing, just in a different way. \nI went back to the beginning of this Z Force board and was reading through some of the topics from the start and have changes the way I do some things because of the information here. One was a thread about the Google keyboard and the lack of a number row. Someone on that thread mentioned that Google now pops up a number row when it thinks you might need it, which kinda interested me to see how well it works. I always turn the long key press time down to at least 200 ms and thought, what if I turned it down to maybe 150 ms to use the top row for numbers when you just need one number here or there. Ends up working out very well for me and I'm finding that I'm much better on the Google keyboard than with Swiftkey which I've been using for a few years now.\nI'm truly enjoying this phone and how fast and smooth Android really can be.

I connect 24/7 to my Pebble and no issues. I connect to my car everyday and no issues. Car is for phone use only, no music - calls and texts.\nDecided to get some BT headphones since I only have the one adapter and nobody seems to know where to get extras. Plus I thought BT would be nice when I am doing yard work or exercising to get the cord out of the way.\n4 days ago I picked up some Aukey Loops from Amazon. Decent reviews from real users vs. all the free shills and I have had good luck with their cables and chargers. Charged them, paired them, sounded halfway decent! Much better than expected honestly after reading how bad some BT headphones can sound. Super comfy and stayed put so I was happy. \nUntil... I tried to connect them a second time (or 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc). They connect instantly. I can receive calls and I can redial my last number easily. No music. All music comes through my phone speaker. If I check my connections it states \"Connected (no media)\". If I turn off BT on my phone and the headset and then pair again 8/10 times it will come back as normal \"Connected\" and music plays. That is the only way I can get it to come back and it is highly annoying!! I want to be able to just turn them on and go, not fuss with them every time. My Pebble and car do it flawlessly every single time. The only 100% sure way to do it is to tell my phone to forget the headphones and then repair them. Not doing that every time!\nI checked all the boxes under settings in BT and the right boxes are marked off. I even turned off media and phone for my car settings to see if that helped based off a tip I read and that didnt work. I also dont want to have to turn those on and off every time if I want to use my car or my headphones.\nDoing a search I saw a TON of complaints going back years with the same complaint from pretty much every manufacturer - Moto, Nexus, Samsung, LG, Sony, etc. What worries me is that I saw NO fix! This is going back to 5.0 through 7.0. I have to hope there is a fix out there with everyone getting BT headphones lately.\nOh - forgot - I tried my friends Jaybirds just to see if they worked. Nope.

My Note 7 seemed kind of like the iphone of the Android world in that it assumed a lot of things for you and in a sense that spoiled me. I'm having to go through that learning curve of finding the right apps to accomplish things. Where I used to be pretty happy with the stock apps on the Note, there either aren't any in some areas, or the stock apps (especially email) sucks canal water an this one.\nThe two issues I am struggling with right now is the screen size (which no one can do anything about) and volume. Believe it or not, that extra screen size on the Note 7 made a pretty big difference, at least to me. I have some eye issues and the extra real estate and the sharpness of the screen were a boon.\nThe other issue, and this is the one I have a question about is the volume. It just does not seem as loud as my Note. I have missed several text messages because of that. Is there a way to bypass the default maximum and up the output on the speaker for things like ringtones and messages? I suspect there isn't, but I though I would ask.\nMy decision now, over the next few days is to decide if these issues are enough of a problem for me to go back to the Note 7 now that they are going to be available.

After messing with it for an hour I gave up. He bought a Z Force soon after.\nAnd for full disclosure every smart phone I've ever owned had been Blackberry or Motorola.

This isn't something I would make an official recommendation on, because it's mostly subjective, and comes down to what you prioritize. For me battery life is the most important thing, and I've been using the battery Mod with this phone. It's absolutely ridiculous! I go 2 full days of serious use. I usually go to sleep with the battery Mod about kicked and then wake up with 80% left on the phone battery. The 80% easily lasts me the next day, and to this point I haven't had to charge again until bedtime on the 2nd day. So it's a for real 48 hour phone with the battery Mod, not just a phone with the capability of getting 48 hours under very particular use. For me that's a game changer. The battery Mod makes it a little heavy and adds thickness, but in my opinion not too thick or heavy given what it does. I personally don't mind the weight, but when you hold a much lighter phone, it's definitely gonna standout. \nAnd... \nCamera is excellent. Definitely better than my wife's 6s and up there with the S7 from comparisons I've done in person. I didn't really test low light in those tests but I don't look to take a lot of low light photos, so not a big deal for me. Overall I've gotten excellent photos, and the flash works perfectly well in dark settings. In marginal light conditions, it's been more than adequate. The T1 camera really wasn't very good as a reference point for my opinion. The T2 had a solid camera, but you needed a really steady hand. I think it's similar on the z-force in terms of what you need to do to optimize your photos. You probably need a steadier hand than you will with the S7 or Iphone. So it might not be quite as easy to point and shoot and get an incredible shot, but the capabilities are right up there with anything on the market. \nAnd the operation is the smoothest of any android phone I've used. I've had the last 3 Motorola flagships, and I thought all of them were buttery smooth, but this phone is on another level. It doesn't lag in the slightest and the screen transition and sensitivity is easily the best on any android phone I've tested.

I think the S7 might be a little easier to snap a great photo in that you just point and shoot fast, and the outcome is always excellent for the most part. I think the moto camera takes a little more skill. It seems more sensitive to motion and it doesn't snap quite as fast, so you really have to keep a steady hand.

The mod potential is there but my gut tells me we won't see more than maybe the camera mod and possibly one other and that will be it. Motorola made a mistake bottom line when it was released as an exclusive to Verizon. Verizon is big but they don't encompass enough users to spark enough compamies to to compete which leads to innovstion. No reason what so ever other than power play that this phone is exclusive to Verizon. What ever happened to compamies using economics 101?

Since the Razr though, I've been Moto-free, using iPhones, Sammy's, LGs and the Nexus 6P. I tried the Moto X Pure last year and hated it. \nAnd although not the prettiest looking, this Moto Z Force Droid is likely the best performing smartphone I've ever used. I was ready to give it up after using it exclusively for a couple weeks when the Note 7 dropped, figuring the new Note would carry me for the rest of the year. However, after about a week comparing the two, aesthetics aside, there is no comparison. \nRight up front the Note 7 - which is using the same Snapdragon 820 chip as the Z Force - is much better looking and has a better camera. In fact, it has the best smartphone camera I've ever used and is the best looking/feeling smartphone I've ever carried. (Nothing will top the StarTac for best feeling phone of all time. Nothing!  ) And if you're a big S-Pen user, this post is meaningless to you, as the Note 7 wins decisively there. \nThat's where the Note 7 advantages stop. Battery life, performance, software, convenience, modularity, durability, memory management - all land squarely in the corner of the Moto Z Force. And that's very surprising, considering they have the same battery size and same CPU. It's truly like using two different phones. The smooth operation of the Z Force compared to the Note 7 is an eye-opener. I don't want to hate on TouchWiz, because I think Samsung has improved TW by leaps and bounds from earlier iterations, but what else could it be? Same battery, same CPU and nearly the same display. I cannot imagine the .2 of inch in display size could make such a difference in performance. \nUnfortunately, Moto/Lenovo's marketing, timing and decision to make it a Verizon exclusive (why, oh why not offer the Z Force and not just the Z to everybody when they beginning selling them unlocked later this month?!) are going to prevent a lot of people from realizing this. By selling it in the window of the Note 7 and next iPhone iteration, well, that's like opening an expected blockbuster movie on the same weekend as The Avengers AND The Hunger Games - not many people will notice you. \nI don't like the long-term outlook for the Moto-Mods line, because the buzz and acceptance just aren't there, outside a few pockets of interest. The Z Force hasn't gone out of stock anywhere, there were no lines to purchase, no pre-sales hype and Moto/Lenovo really seems to rub a lot of former fans the wrong way with its business practices. But for as long as I have it, I'm going to enjoy it.

The Nexus is supposed to do \"always listening\", but it never worked well, where the Motos have. The chop for flashlight & twist for camera is wonderful too.- Durability.

This year, I've had the S7, S7 Edge, G5 and now the Moto Z. I also have the Note 7 on order. I wanted to provide a quick comparison of the Moto Z to the S7 Edge (the best phone I've used this year). It's purely my opinion and am posting to maybe help somebody who is on the fence on which phone to buy.\nPoints for the Moto Z\n- Speed: I know the internals are similar but the Moto Z is just much zippier. I'm not a benchmark guy, but the difference in my opinion is very noticeable in day to day use. Frankly, this surprised me.\n- Battery life: Although the S7 Edge battery life is really good, I think the Moto Z may be even slightly better. \n- Moto Mods - I flat out love them mostly because I'm just a gadget guy. I bought all three. \n- Screen: I am not a fan of the curved screen and having used the S7 Edge for the last couple of months, it's nice to use a phone with a traditional (flat) screen.\n- I love knowing the screen won't shatter. I'm still going to use tempered glass just to ensure it won't get any surface scratches but this is a sense of security that no other phone offers.\nPoints for the S7 Edge\n- Camera. This is really, the only disappointment to me with this phone. With the S7 Edge, I know almost any picture I take is crisp and clear. Not so with the Moto. In my opinion, the delta is quite noticeable in all pictures with the exception of those taken in bright sunlight.\n- Feel: Even though I love the feel of the phone, it's actually a little bit more slippery with the moto back on it than when it's naked. Probably a personal preference but worth mentioning. The phone is also a bit heavier than S7. Not much but noticeable. \n- Waterproof. I know the Moto Z is splashproof but I enjoy taking my S7 into the pool and take solace knowing if I drop it, it'll survive. \nScreen: The Moto Z screen is great and perfectly fine for use... until you compare it to a Samsung screen. Again though, the Moto Z is perfectly fine for every day use.\nI usually don't post my thoughts on phones. I did for this one because frankly, I think the Moto Z is a better phone than some of the reviews make it out to be. If somebody were to ask me which one to buy, I'd fire back one question to then: how important is the camera to you? If it's super important, go S7. If not, you'll love the Moto Z.", "time": "08-08-2016 11:52 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5309967", "text": "I sold my S7 edge yesterday at Best Buy and I picked up the Moto Z Force Droid and I must say, I like this phone better. I'm a heavy user and battery life is really important to me. I love the Incipio Offgrid Power Pack motomod! It's really thin against the phone. I hardly even notice that I'm using a battery pack. I had the mophie juice pack for my S7 edge and it was massive. I had the LG G5 for a week earlier this year and the moto does mods so much better. I love that the mods are hot swappable. I don't know why any company would bother making mods for the G5, to be honest.\nThe camera on the Z Force seems fine to me. DxOMark gave it a score of 87. The S7 edge has a score of 88. They're pretty close in quality. The S7 edge took slightly better lowlight photos and it had quicker focus.\nI hated the blue hue that was on the edge screen on the S7 edge. I didn't even use the edge features because they were pretty pointless. \nMy only complaint about the Z Force is that it doesn't have an IP68 rating. It's splashproof so that is good enough for me.\nI have 13 days to return this phone if I don't like it. I may switch it out for the Note7, but I honestly don't see that happening.

From the Droid Max, to the Turbo and Turbo 2 they've consistently had battery capacities that for their relative sizes are significantly larger than the competition's. The other manufacturers, namely Samsung in this case, are just catching up if anything. So to ask how the phone reacts while you're using it, and imply it dies under 1 day just like any other phone, is completely erroneous. On the last 3 phones I've owned by Moto, I can get through more than a day with heavy use without any issues, and it sounds like the Force is comparable.

I can spell out why on a model-by-model basis if you like. It seems that you simply don't like Motorola phones, and think the Z is too expensive. That's fine, you're entitled to your opinion, though at some point sharing repeatedly without getting into why isn't productive, and you need to understand that some of your complaints are simply preference or opinion.\nI do agree that it's disappointing that updates aren't as fast or dependable as they once were. That was one thing that made me hesitate at buying my Zf. However, while I was tempted to hold out for one of the new Nexus phones, my previous phone was the Nexus 6, and I really missed some of the Motorola features, like the enhanced always listening, twist for camera, etc. My Droid Maxx didn't have the chop for flashlight or the sensors where you can wave your hand & see notifications, and I'm loving those additions.\nAlso, while it's fair to be cautious about build quality with the transition over to devices developed under Lenovo, there's every indication that the build quality on the Z/Zf is excellent. You ask why it's worth similar money as iPhones or Samsung Galaxys, and the answer is build quality, features & specs, and discounts (few are going to pay full price for these phones, unless it's through a no-interest 2yr payment plan).\nBy the way, the camera bump is only there if you don't use a style mod, which is included, and I think Moto expects most people to use if they're not using another mod. You question the mods' usefulness, and that's fair, but the phone is excellent without them. And the regular Z has enough battery to go through a day for more average users, and the Force has enough battery to get through the day for somewhat heavy users. The fact that the battery mod is an option is icing on the cake. I have the Zf, and so far I don't see myself buying a battery mod unless i'ts on sale and I buy it for when I travel and use my phone heavily due to a lot of time to kill.

Its more stock than I'm used to. I got used to having a lot of features that this phone doesn't have. At first, it was strange, then I realized I never used most of the stuff anyway. Simple seems better to me. \n3. Display. I can read this anywhere. Indoor, outdoor, its fine.\n4. Camera. Simple, not the best but far from the worst. I like the fact that it just uses Google Photo and no BS.\n5. Antennae. I can connect to any wifi and the phone works fine. Data seems to be able to connect with no issue also. \n6. Battery. Quite simply, its great. I can get all day and more. My first day was a fairly light day and I forgot to plug it in before bed. It had 40% in the morning. Not too shabby. When I get a mod battery, it will probably last two solid days under light use. \n7. I bought an case for it and it sucks. The USB C charger is big and it charges fast, but all the cases seem to be designed for micro USB.\n8. Fingerprint sensor. Just as weird as getting used to the back buttons on the LG's I owned.

Coming from the Turbo, and before that the DM, I'm used to using my catch phrase to read my notifications. On my MZFD when I use my launch phrase I get to the pin unlock screen which negates the whole purpose of touchless. I keep going through the settings, but I don't see a command to eliminate that pin setting screen. It seems Moto keeps dumbing down its touchless implementation on its phones.

Turn off any & all PIN, fingerprint, etc. This is done under Security in the settings menu. Then it should work with the phrase seamlessly.\n- Set up trusted places/devices so that you generally don't have to put in security information if you're in a secure place or connected to a trusted device, and the phrase should work most of the time without having to put in security information.", "time": "07-29-2016 11:17 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5291527", "text": "Thanks for the advice, YAYTech.

Screen image quality seemed similar. As has been said in reviews, with that mongo bottom bezel why didn't they put the buttons down there??? I'll just assume there was no room to fit extra electronics. \nWith the regular wood back on the Force the phone felt fine and very comfortable in the hand, although when I put the battery mod on it it became unnecessarily heavy for something you'd carry around all day. I don't know how that compares to people with other phones that use Mophie cases, but I can't see carrying the phone around with the battery mod all day, nor can I see putting it on just to use it for wireless charging. It was comfortable to hold as far as size and shape, but just too heavy.\nThe phone seemed fast, but all brand new phones seem that way. My T2 has significant lag with a lot of things which really annoys me. I clear the cache every so often which helps some, but it's still laggy.\nThe camera seemed good, although it's hard to get a good sense just testing it there in the store and then not being able to send myself full res versions of the pics to compare. It should take better pics than my T2 though.\nThe fingerprint scanner wasn't set up, but I could tell that it reacts very fast just based on it prompting me to set it up when I touched my finger to it. \nI didn't find the visible sensors on the white model to be annoying at all, certainly not any more than on my white T2, which is to say that I really don't even notice them. \nWith the back off and the phone sitting flat there is definitely wobble because of the camera protruding. Don't plan on doing any typing like that. I can't really see using these phones without a back on them. \nI can't imagine using either the video or speaker mods myself. The store rep said he would use the projector mod for presentations or for showing movies on the side of his house outside at night. Really? Ok. I don't know when I'd use the speaker as opposed to a regular bluetooth speaker option with better sound.\nSo in the end... I'm not sure if it's worth the cost of the upgrade or not for me. I could probably manage without the 3.5mm jack, but I really like the wireless charging on my T2 for sitting on my nightstand at night and just grabbing it off to check things and then placing it back to charge. I also use an AirDock in my car that provides some wireless charging. I think if they came out with just a thin back that just adds wireless charging I could probably be talked into the phone. I'd be curious to know how the 3500mah battery would last in a normal day for me compared to the 3750 on my T2.

By that I mean if they bypass the built in lens and sensor, add an optical zoom and keep it low profile they could do well with it.
