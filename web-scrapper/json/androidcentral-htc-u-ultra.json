Far too many people assume that the screen size reflects the device's overall dimensions when in fact, the size of the bezel needs to be taken into account.\nThe truth is, a 3000mAh battery is just too small for the U Ultra's dimensions. \nThe U measures 6.39 inches on height, 3.14 inches on width and 0.31 inches on depth (that's 162.4mm on height, 79.8mm on width and 8mm on depth if you're eager to know how it's like with the metric system).

You might get solid results out of it, but once you use a phone like the Mate 9, you start to wonder how HTC thought that 3000mAh is fine for a device that huge. It's even more damning when you know that there's no headphone jack and HTC didn't even bother to make full use of whatever space it frees up.\nAlso note that it has to power not just a 5.7\" QHD display but a secondary 0.2\" ticker display as well. That's a whole 5.9\" of display space to power. And since IPS LCD hasn't caught on much in terms of display efficiency compared to OLED, it's just not as efficient as its OLED counterparts.\nI'm happy that you get solid runtime out of your U Ultra, but I can't and won't let HTC off the hook for packing a rather anemic battery for such a huge phone.", "time": "03-17-2017 12:50 AM", "replies": []}, {"postID": "post5715233", "text": "I don't think I'd classify the 3000 mAh battery in the U Ultra as \"small\" but it's definitely not what you'd originally expect for a phone of this size.

I did a video review for the phone, but if you want a more summarised version, just read below to save time. \nIn a nutshell, i would say this is a really decent smartphone. The camera is actually remarkably good, with consistent performance and natural looking colours. The performance is decent. The software experience, other than HTC's skin, works mostly similar to stock Android with some google apps as the default. The design is pretty striking too in the sapphire blue variant, albeit having big bezels.\nBut it's a phone that I probably wouldn't recommend most people to get at this point in time with the newer phones announced, or going to be announced soon. Especially not at its asking price.\nWhen I compare it to devices like the V20, Mate 9, Google Pixel, Galaxy S7 Edge (all of which I've tested myself), there isn't really anything that is particularly impressive on the U Ultra. Even when comparing it to the HTC 10 it's not a clear win for the U Ultra. While the U Ultra has a bigger screen, better rear camera, it loses the headset jack (not a huge deal for me, but some people might not like it), loses the OIS on the front camera, and the battery life doesn't seem be be as good (with the second screen on).\nAnd i'm still comparing it to devices from 2016 at this point. I can't help but feel like the phone came out a bit too late. It's still a really nice phone for most people I think, but for the more tech savvy, the only reason to go for the U Ultra would probably be the design and someone who wants a bigger HTC flagship device.\nIf you watched my video, you'll probably find it a bit on the negative side of things, and I really can't help it. I've been a fan of the company's product since the One X. And really its main series of smartphone has been constantly decent (except for the One M9 IMO), and perhaps a little bit too constant considering how much other manufacturers have improved. But in the past years of so, its product lineup has been somewhat of a mess (HTC 10 Lifestyle, Desire 10 Pro, One M9+, One E8, One E9+, One ME, One X9, One A9, etc). \nThis makes the U Ultra more heartbreaking disappointing to me considering how much expectations I had from the company. Especially after what I considered to be their return to form with the HTC 10. Anyway, hope this review will be helpful for those considering to get this phone. It's still a good phone, but perhaps I was just expecting a bit too much. If only the phone was priced more reasonably.\nAnyone already got the phone or thinking about it?

The only downside for me is the lack of a headphone jack. Considering that it won't work with any of the USB-C adapters I tried, this is a fatal flaw. Other than that it's pretty much the same as the LG G6 hardware wise and has the exactly same price. While 749$ isn't exactly cheap, it seems that all manufacturers have together decided to hike the prices this year. I believe the U Ultra will end up being one of the more moderately priced phones this year. The Huawei P10 Plus costs more, the S8 and the Sony XZ Premium will both be considerably more and the new iPhone will likely go for over a grand. The problem with the U Ultra is that it's fairly mainstream. It's the same device as the LG G6 and the Huawei. So why would anyone buy the one without the headphone jack if the others all have it and cost the same?\nThe 821 processor is a non-issue by the way. Early benchmarks of the S8 with its 835 are fairly discouraging. The S8 is barely faster than the S7. The 821 might actually turn out to be the better choice as it's quite low power and runs very cool. \nThe battery in the U Ultra isn't huge, but it lasts a full day and charges extremely fast.\nThe question remains: why buy this one rather than, say, a Pixel XL or an LG G6? Since they're all the same, it really doesn't matter. The second screen is very gimmicky and really does absolutely nothing for me. The lack of a headphone jack and no adapter available plain sucks. If it were priced 100$ less, it'd probably sell OK, but as it stands now, this will be a failure for HTC, IMO.

I have the black version and it is absolutely stunning. Fingerprints are not an issue and the device feels great in the hand. Much better than the HTC 10The second display is not a gimmick. It is very useful for notifications, and for quick shortcuts to contacts and apps. I use it a lot in these two days. Of course, important is to see what happens with usage when the novelty wears off. I really like it so farThe fingerprint sensor works very well, better than on the HTC 10Battery life: The press has been complaining about the 3000mAh battery of the Ultra, but it lasts the whole day with no issues. It is interesting that the same press doesn't have a problem with the Samsung S8 and its battery capacity..I wonder why is this happening (bias or money from Samsung)Audio quality is great. The speakers are really good and the sound through the usb-c speakers very very goodThe camera is great, better than on the HTC 10.The UI: Typical Sense, very fluidThe display is amazing. Very good brightness and sunlight visibility\nWhat I don't like:The device is very big. 90% of the time I don't mind that, but some people might have issues with the size of the device.The capacitive buttons could be placed better, more central.The Sense companion is useless so far. That might change in the future, but I wouldn't keep my hopes up. We will see.\nOverall, this is a top device and the press is just flat out lying about it. I understand that HTC doesn't have the marketing power of Apple or Samsung, but the press should try to be more objective. I watched the review video of the S8+ from Android Central and I was really mad. It was like a marketing pitch from Samsung. I wonder why this is happening..\nAndroid Central and other members of the press are not treating all manufacturers in the same way. \nLet me give you some examples:\nThe S8 has a small battery for its display size? No problem. It is a Samsung device so this regression is not important.\nThe HTC U Ultra has a small battery? All hell breaks loose. HTC didn't deliver\nThe S8 hat a badly positioned fingerprint sensor? It's ok, don't worry. It's a non issue..If other OEMs did that, the press would punish them hard.\nThe S8 has an Edge display which causes a lot of trouble because people might accidentally press the sides/edges of it. \nThe S8 has a UI which drops frames and is not as fluid as the Pixel or other devices (just read Ars Technicas review).\nWhy Android Central? I understand that you are a company that needs to make money, but you should be more objective.\nNo device is perfect, but when you present the same topic differently, depending on the device you are testing. Very sad.\nAnyway, the HTC U Ultra is a great flagship and it deserves much better sales..", "time": "04-22-2017 07:56 AM", "replies": [{"postID": "post5779268", "text": "Thanks for this.\nWhat do you mean by USB C speaker??

Also I really don't like AMOLED screens despite what the majority seem to feel so that was another thing that drew me to the U Ultra. I also have no light bleed anywhere on the screen and have to say I have mine on full brightness nearly all of the time and tend to use dark wallpapers so if it was there it would of shown up by now and the screen is absolutely brilliant being bright and clear. I managed to get an awesome deal on a 2 day old Black U Ultra although I think I would of still got one even if I had to pay full price to me HTC just build awesome phones and this one doesn't disappoint on build quality. I am finding the 2nd display to be really useful and a good addition and also don't get all the negative reviews and general hate that so many are giving for this phone. I chose this over any of the other so called flagship phones and have no regrets at all and seriously don't get all the fuss made about only having a Snapdragon 821 as I really think the differences between it and the 835 are going to be so slight as to not really be worth worrying about. Same goes for the battery size non issue IMO as I'm sure everyone would be complaining about how much heavier the phone would be with a larger battery and the fact it has fast charging sort of negates this issue to IMO plus it easily lasts me a day anyway.
