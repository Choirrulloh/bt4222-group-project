I waited about three minutes for this shot, and you can tell that the skies were not overexposed at all. Saves you the trouble of compositing the photo like you would with a traditional camera, right? So excited to be breaking grounds with the incredible P9 camera… 

It’s been lovely so far, see you all on the other side, and thank you! - @beautifuladieu

I’m amazed at how the Huawei P9 handles the details and saves the shadows. It’s difficult to expose the shadows adequately without blowing the highlights, but the P9 managed it so well! 

Let’s be honest, I’m impressed. Aren’t you too?

To put it simply, it takes multiple exposures of the scene and automatically stacks them to give you a high dynamic range (HDR) image that is not over the top. 

It also eliminates the noise you’d normally expect from taking a photo at night…But remember to use a tripod for this mode!

You can see the circular bokeh in the background that makes the photo really look like it was taken using a professional prime lens.

Aslo, you can readjust the aperture from f/0.95 to f/16 and watch your photo transform accordingly – it’s such a magical thing to see!

What’s going to make your shot stand out is not only having good lighting and a good camera, but also good composition! 

Did you know that you have more than one overlay option to help you with composing your shot? For all you composition junkies, there’s your regular 3x3 grid, phi (golden ratio) grid, and spiral overlay. 

You’ll have no excuses for not creating your own perfect shot now!

Even in its regular mode, the Huawei P9 delivers exceptionally sharp and vivid images with its dual lens. One sensor is used to capture colors, while the other sensor captures all the details!

The P9 camera is seriously all you’ll ever need when you want to go light, without the bulkiness of your camera!
