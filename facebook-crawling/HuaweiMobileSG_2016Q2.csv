It is pretty easy to take a high quality photo for the close objective with the use of wide aperture mode. Other than that, adjusting the focal point allow you to blur the background and make the subject more outstanding after taken the photo! 

Note: Make sure that the subject is no longer than 2 meters (6ft) from the camera for optimum results.

Monochrome: 
There is no barriers for you to take a classic photo anymore. The camera comes with a separate lens designed specifically for black and white shots.

Pro Camera Mode:       
Enabling you to fine-tune photos and gives you full control over composition, exposure, and shutter speed!

With that, you will have to pay extra in times of need for repair/servicing. 

To check on your warranty, visit http://consumer.huawei.com/sg/support/warranty-query/index.htm

And enter your set’s IMEI. If it is an export set, an error message “Sorry, the system can not query the match information.” will pop out. If it’s a local set, the web will advice you on the warranty period based on the manufacturing date of the phone.",4,photo
