Question: How much is the R9s? 
Answer: $679

Question: Why would i pre-order instead of buying it when it's released?
Answer: You'll receive an OPPO Lens Kit worth $218 when you pre-order! Also, the lens kits are in limited quantity!

Question: What happens when the lens kits are all gone?
Answer: Our current plan is to close the pre-orders. So hurry! Fastest fingers first.

Question: What color is available?
Answer: As of now, Gold. Why is it only in gold? We fought really hard to bring the R9s to our shores as soon as possible, and managed to push through the Gold version as a first wave :) We're one of the first 2 countries that are releasing the R9s outside of China. It's great to be in Singapore! :D 

Question: When is Rose Gold coming in?
Answer: Our other signature color will be coming in some time in January. 

Question: Will the other colors have a pre-order to receive the OPPO lens kit?
Answer: We haven't had any confirmation on this. 

Question: Will R9s be available in black?
Answer: As of now we're really not sure if we are able to carry it into Singapore. Let's all keep our fingers crossed.

Question: Is the R9s Plus available?
Answer: It will arrive on our shores some time next year. Stay tuned!

Question: When will the R9s launch with the Telcos?
Answer: It will launch on the 10th Dec :) However do note that the OPPO Lens Kit is only available for during pre-orders and will not be available after launch (unless we have an exclusive campaign after).",25,photo
