To mark the launch of Xiaomi's Mi Ecosystem, we also launched our latest product under Mi Ecosystem, the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker, an incredibly advanced rice cooker that uses technology and innovative design to help you cook rice perfectly all the time. Features: 

-WiFi-enabled smart cooker that can be controlled from your smartphone via the Mi Home app. Scan the packaging label and our rice cooker will intelligently choose which heating method to use based on the rice type and brand. Currently there are 200 brands of rice recognized by the app with more to come. The app also has 2,450 (2,450!!) different heating methods. 
- Employs a magnetic relief valve to precisely control pressure inside the rice cooker to create optimal boiling point of water, which results in more flavorful rice
- Electromagnetic heating technology delivers higher thermal efficiency for even cooking
- Gray cast iron lining for even heating and strong thermal performance
- PFA powder coating solves the issue of rice sticking to the bottom of the pot

""Xiaomi's impressive Mi 5 has the features to stand up against the very best...The Xiaomi Mi 5 has a sleek, lightweight design with a beautiful finish that's as good as any high-end phone. Great camera and dual-SIM features will let you use this as a travel phone too.

When I pulled out the pretty, lightweight Mi 5 in public, curious strangers who had never seen a Xiaomi phone before asked what it was... It works, and it works marvellously.. Photos are never more important than when you're capturing memories of the trip of a lifetime. The Mi 5's 16-megapixel camera didn't let me down.

The Mi 5 runs smooth as silk. Need to take a picture? Tap on the icon and boom, it's ready to take a shot. Switching between apps had nary a pause -- the phone has 3GB of RAM, enough to keep apps in memory without having to reload. If you're gamer with a penchant for great graphics, you're in good hands with the Mi 5.""

Other smartphones use only 2-axis OIS, which is not as effective as 4-axis, which compensates for movement across all possible directions‚Äîrotational and lateral movement‚Äîduring photography. This means that your photos will remain clear, sharp and in focus whether you're taking a shot in candlelight or trying to snap a photo of your hyperactive puppy. 

This technology is complicated and difficult to integrate into a smartphone, especially one that is as light (129g) and thin as Mi 5, and yet we were able to achieve it.
