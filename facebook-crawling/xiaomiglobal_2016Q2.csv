""The Xiaomi Mi 5 is a darned good smartphone for the price, but it's the ecosystem that makes it intriguing.

The Mi 5 is a conversation-starter, at least in my experience. People see the aluminum trim and curved white glass back and want to know what they‚Äôre looking at‚Äîa rare quality for a sub-$400 phone.

The Mi 5 excels at more than just looks. It‚Äôs also fast at opening, closing, and moving through apps, thanks to a top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 3 GB of RAM. Xiaomi didn‚Äôt skimp on the display, in terms of maximum brightness and viewing angles, and offering more pristine whites and vibrant colors to my eye.""
